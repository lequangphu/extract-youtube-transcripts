31 32 32 now okay great yeah good i was feeling bad i'm 33 and you're always like yeah we're basically the same age we're both 30 31. well i do it to slight you i do it as a joke because you're only a year older than me but i want to make it clear that you're all of the be still yeah yeah yeah and in my head i immediately stop listening to everything else you say and i just start thinking in my head i'm older than sam and then i have to be like why does that matter who cares and then i get back and i don't even know what's going on yeah 35 okay great i do it this will feel even worse now um my my trainer by the way he's at a 40 41 something like that and he looks great looks like he's 25 and anytime someone's like oh wow i didn't know that you know once they find out his age or whatever he's just like um he's like i'm living to 105 and he's constantly watching videos of people who are like 105 but healthy or like 100 and they have like you know they're still like madly in love with their husband or wife and he's just constantly watching these videos these outlier examples to be like that's me i'm going to have that life do you care about living until you're like really old yeah well i tell everyone 1 30. i say okay great i say i'm gonna be 130 but i'm gonna i'm gonna act like a current 70 year old so like my like the 70 year olds now that's what i'm going to be when i'm 130. okay why 130 where is that number from nice ambitious but realistic number i think that so i went out with this guy the other day and he's a um no i'll i'll name drop you look out can i name drop i went out with lance armstrong i got dinner with lance dude you weren't gonna say that you were just going to say i went out with this guy the other day yeah well yeah amazing i i i i ha the reason i'm saying that is like it come from a reputable source uh and he had this uh guy who worked at adidas and nike with them this like huge rip guy who was like he's probably 55 or so and he was telling me that there's a direct correlation between lean muscle mass and age so like longevity so the people who have more muscle at an older age are more likely to live longer and so that was like a realization to me so uh anyway that was uh so two for one you get to be jacked now and live forever yeah um but um wait what were we talking about oh yeah but i do but so we just did this little thing let's get back into it i got a card an email from my aunt my aunt debbie who's in her 50s called i forget what it was called but it was american greetings was the name of the company or the main i whenever i get like one of these things i scroll straight to the bottom and it says like the name of the brand but then it says like copyright american greeting right the like terms and conditions part yeah i'm like all right that's the good stuff so i always like wikipedia um and it was this company it's a greeting card company that just closed can i pause you one second that thing you just said that this podcast has like rewired my brain where that's all i do now i'm like oh cool this thing is in my life who's behind this how much do they make what's the company what's the backstory is there an epic founder behind this i was at the dentist and he's showing me an x-ray of my teeth yesterday and instead of looking at he's like pointing out something in my teeth he's like oh yeah who makes that machine i'm looking at the name of the software in the top left corner it's like vm you know vm imaging and i'm like i'm like hey can you hand me my phone real quick i need to just i need to write this down i'm gonna go look up this company i bet it makes like billions of dollars doing this x-ray software for dentists office or like he was like scraping my tooth with some tool and i was just thinking why isn't there like better divide this is the same scraper they've been using since like i was 10. uh who if every dentist is buying these things these things can't cost they have to cost a lot of money who's what's the company that makes these little devices and are they innovating why not you know blah blah blah so my brain has been like i have like this chip in my brain now that that has to get to the root source of every product i feel which is what you whenever i sent you a birthday card well when i see a building like a huge warehouse if that where like if it's a massive warehouse and there's a sign on it i always look up what's the story of that right i always do that so yeah i was thinking like you know people are excited about ar or like when google glass came out and they're like oh it's great you'll be able to read your email or you'll be able to like see directions you know like the map will be in front of your eyes and i was like the killer app of this is i just look at somebody and it tells me who they are like i can just like you know like when you you stalk someone you see someone interesting you like try to look them up you find their instagram you see what their life's all about i think it's gonna be amazing when we just have contacts or glasses and i could just look at you it'll be like sampar ceo of the hustle blah blah your last two tweets next to your face floating above you you have no idea that i just have like well there's also interrogated you there's also practical stuff me and sarah were walking on the street the other day and sarah saw a guy with college shirt and she's like i think we know that person but i can't tell because all white guys with collared shirts look look the same to me there's some practical there's some practical implications dude when i was a kid and i would use my fake id i had a fake id and the guy was a white dude but he had like a shaved head and it was like he had clearly had black hair but if you go to the indian or the black stores with like a black color like a different a clerk of a different race they all thought that like always looks just like you so the joke was you have to go to a like a person who's not white because they all think we look exactly the same did you ever do that when you're a kid like you go to like you got to go to the white collar i didn't realize that hack um but that makes perfect sense to me yeah do you think all white people look alike uh no not all white people look alike but definitely like you know john jeff and jacob you know i might mix them up from time to yeah in time same way that you know i look like you know i'm sorry to everybody you know what i mean like yeah but we were talking about american greetings american greetings and the reason i bring this up huge company and it's just crazy that this still exists um but i guess it's not that crazy it's funny just to explain in simple terms they do e-cards so you can send it to somebody 20 a year yeah 20 year membership and uh they do above a billion dollars in revenue they own multiple smaller brands so they own like jackie lawson have you ever heard of jackie lawson by the way no you should google this name so jackie lawson go look at her website and uh like welcome to 1982 so just i i mean whoever's doing the video on this you've got to pull up the job literally okay so that the profile photo looks like you know some bootleg carmen san diego and then it says jackie lawson and then like there's like there's like a mouse like a computer mouse is like like part of the n because probably like when she invented this it was like new to be like on the computer sending cards to people and uh this thing is incredibly popular people love jackie lawson cards she's like a really well-known solder company i think to american greetings and um i ran a company for a period of time maybe a year or two it's called birthdayalarm.com by the way i didn't start this company but the company's kind of remarkable i'll break it down so um michael and xochi birch were the investors in my previous company this was their first win so michael is a programmer at an insurance company he's like ah this is boring wants to go do a startup he comes up with this big idea to do a self-updating address book meaning like what if you had a contact list that was like dynamic so i'm in your address book if i ever move i can just change my address or my my email address or whatever and it'll automatically update in everyone's contact list uh you know dynamically so you have this idea of this um you build this product it's really complicated it's not really going anywhere but he adds one feature to the address book which is uh birthday what's your birthday and um which is ironically the thing that doesn't change you don't need a dynamic address book to do that but he started sending a reminder so like a little reminder would come out like i should have got a reminder yesterday that said hey it's sam's birthday today wish him happy birthday and um and this was before facebook so this is actually an incredible you incredibly useful thing so people used to email him being like hey um thanks so much for that birthday reminder i would have totally forgot my aunt's birthday you know you saved me on that one or you know i looked like husband of the year because of that birthday reminder and um so he's like nobody likes my thing but they just like this one feature so he makes that the product so he goes he makes it birthdayalarm.com and all it does is it reminds you of your friends and family's birthday and um immediately the the site starts to like do a little bit better but not like not gangbusters yet so he says okay well how does this product work i should be able to email all my friends and family and say hey add your birthday to my my birthday alarm calendar and um and then he does he at the time there was no term for viral marketing but he's like i don't have a budget to do you know i quit my job to go try to make it big in the startup world so i don't have a marketing budget so i need one user to recruit another so here's what i'll do when i email all my friends and families to add their birthday to mine and they go type in june 15th then it'll say do you want to save sean's birthday and your calendar and they're like oh yeah sure why not you know tit for tat he just asked for mine i'll take his and then it says cool your birth your calendar has one birthday in it who else's birthday do you want to know send this to your friends and family so that became the viral loop and all of a sudden he started getting tens of thousands of members still a free product but tens of thousands of users at the time to him felt like a million dollars it was like oh my god i've actually made something that's growing and then he's like all right how do i make this even better so he's just he went all in on this virality piece he didn't try to figure out the business model and he's like how do i make this even more viral and so he's like well today there's still all these steps involved i gotta type in each person's email address i have to figure out what to write so he starts one by one changing these pieces he's like oh instead of you having to think what to write i'll write it for you just copy paste this right here's a copy button to copy this into your email a client and then he's like could i just send this to their whole email address book and at the time nobody was really doing this and so he wrote one of the first scrapers for hotmail where he where you could just log into your hotmail and he's like great i imported all your contacts just hit send and it'll send to all of them and um he's like dude this is kind of crazy like he's like for sure hotmail is going to shut this down in 10 days but uh whatever 10 days of growth let's do it and so immediately he wakes up next morning and there's like 100 000 members and it just keeps growing exponentially after that and you know here we are he started that website in 2001 so 20 years later you could still do that thing in hotmail at gmail where you import your address book they never were able to like fully shut it down and so he's like that hack that i thought would last 10 days lasted 20 years and the site started growing exponentially so now it has you know it's had over i don't know maybe a hundred million members at this point um add their birthdays making like five million dollars a year every single year so at that point it's free now what happens is his buddy morgan um he who's like a a friend of his sends them a link to uh i don't know what it was it was either jackie lawson american greetings blue mountain one of these websites he goes dude you should do e-cards um i made a i made an e-card website you should add e-cards that could be the business model sell birthday cards right don't just remind them of the birthday let them wish them a happy birthday turns that on immediately starts making ten thousand dollars a day or whatever numbers are not exact in fact we re-released his episodes you can go listen to the exacts but basically starts making money that business with just like pretty bare bones so it was him working on his wife working on it you know his sister-in-law did the books and there was like you know cousin did customer support it ran like that for a number of years and just had like you know outsourced people making ecards and it was making at its peak four or five million dollars a year of revenue with most of that being profit like maybe 80 profit at that time and it ran like that for a number of years he used that to self-fund his next startup a social network called bebo and then because he self-funded it with birthday alarm when he sold bibo for 850 million dollars the husband and wife duo they owned like 70 plus of the company because he had self-funded it using it this using this e-card website and so when i went to go run his idea lab that was still the cash cow that was paying for that fancy office you saw all those silicon valley engineers most of it was because birthday alarm was still cranking two million dollars a year of profit even though nobody was working on it and there had been no updates for like multiple years at that point and so then i took it and we tried to like turn it around and make it grow again and so it started to grow again um you know after we worked on it but because of that i looked into jackie lawson and american greetings and jib jab and all these different companies and this space is actually pretty big yeah well that's why i brought this up because i knew i would get a story out of you like that there's also one other company that somebody who listens to the podcast had told us i'll give them a shout have you seen this app called givingly no so it's a it's a new age version of this same idea so giving me what they do what they make easy is that they're like not just good looking cards but a gift card to like any service so uh like it was my trainer's birthday i wanted to get him something i had forgotten to give him a gift and so i sent him a givingly which was like a beautiful little e-card i made on my phone in like you know five minutes and then i was able to attach like 100 door dash pass to it so it's like oh dinner tonight's on me is what i sent him and um and so it was like so easy to send a gift and a gift card and i was like oh this is actually kind of interesting and so i talked to the founders and their stats are honestly pretty impressive people send a ton of these and the way that they grew is a little unconventional they grew as a snapchat mini app which like you kind of don't hear anyone talking about like do you ever hear about snapchat minis no i don't even know what that is they released this like app platform called minis and like you never really hear anybody talking about it and then when they showed me their numbers i'm like dude where are you getting like hundreds of thousands of users and they're like oh snapchat like people on snapchat just send little cards back and forth to each other all the time we're the number one mini and it's like what and so i went and looked in the little mini store and sure enough they were like one or two uh at the time so i thought that was kind of interesting and it made me think oh i should do a deep dive into minis and see what else is actually working here that's that's fascinating and that's we've talked about this like idea of like you need distribution first and if you have that you have everything and like that's why i like chrome plugins that's why i like uh wordpress plugins i didn't even know about minis yeah and you know i don't know if you need it first there is definitely like a case for that other people will say no you need a product people love and other people say no you need a great team and like the way i think about it is this guy near ayal who i think also listens podcast he wrote this book called hooked and oh he's a listener that's cool i've i've read that book yeah and so he uh it's awesome book and so he he had told me this once in my office he goes uh every business is like a three-legged stool you have growth you have engagement and you have monetization gem and he's like uh you know when you start your startup you have none you just have like you know a stool with no legs and then you need to get your first leg on there it can be growth or it can be engagement like a sticky product that people love um he's like a good startup will have two and if you have two you have a pretty good shot of figuring out the third the problem is there's a whole bunch of people here with one-legged stools uh trying to go raise money and uh i thought that was so spot-on and so then when i looked at companies i just thought to myself oh do they have all three legs figured out two of the three i'm okay with one of the three i'm gonna wait dude i dig it i and i completely agree with that um we have like a ton of ideas here i'm i'm really excited can i tell you something really quick though that i learned yeah so do you remember is it called pro republic what was that article that got released with rich people i think pro republic was the name it was like the billionaire taxes i didn't read it by the way so i don't know you don't have to have read it but there okay so there's something going i didn't read it either but it's not important because it's the general topic of this of like how rich people pay little taxes and they do that by basically and like i don't know how to bring this up without sounding like a total douche but when you make little money like you get access to loans that are like 1.5 percent or 1.2 or whatever it is it's it's based off of like a lot of times they'll be watching people get the most free whether it's or cheap capital or cheap anything yeah basically like when you sign up for like a big bank you get a line of credit like i think it's 75 of your of the amount of money you have in there uh at like a one percent rate or it's like based off the london bond exchange and i was curious about this but basically a lot of folks like elon and just most people who are wealthy or a lot of people who are wealthy they take loans and that's what they use to live on but in my head i'm like but you still gotta pay that back so how are they doing that and i went and talked to some bankers and you know how this like do you know what the expectation is here the expectation is that you actually live on those loans forever forever yeah and your estate pays it when you die is that crazy is that a crazy thing to think about i kept thinking like but how does the bank get their money back and it's like oh no no like we expect that it's going to be an outstanding loan for like 50 years and we're just going to keep loaning and loaning and loaning and then when they die they're not trying to make their money off you the wealthy person they're trying to take all of your millions and millions of dollars and lend it out to other people who are gonna pay higher rates so they're like okay we need to lend money where do we get the money let's get the money from rich people how do we get the money from rich people we offer them amazing terms okay then how do we make money well we're going to take that money and we're going to lend it to people who don't have as much and we're going to charge them more right kind of sounds screwed up when you say it but that's the business model here i believe yeah it's just like something that i didn't understand i feel like if i'm wrong i might be wrong because i'm not a banker nor am i a bank nor have i thought about this stuff it's just weird i just thought that was weird and that was totally like that was one of those things where it's like well it's funny why this is how the world works i was like i didn't know that i'm just like well it's funny because like you're like oh um you're the ceo how much do you make oh wow this ceo came out and said he's taking a one dollar salary for the year what a great guy he's like no obviously that that just means he doesn't make his money off his salary he makes it off something else okay he's getting stuck okay great wow he's getting all the stock stocks going up you must pay a ton in taxes no no he he doesn't why is that well he doesn't sell the stock so he doesn't realize any gain okay then how does he pay for like that jet oh because he just like len he gets a big loan or line of credit off of his stock as collateral and so wait so he lives for free off that loan yeah yeah he does he just has to pay you know one percent or two percent or three percent interest oh wow that seems pretty good okay even better let's say he takes that money and uses it to invest now that interest payment is also tax deductible so it's like just gets like kind of crazy how the advantages sort of stack up against each other it was just he bought real estate great now he's gonna take this huge depreciation you know uh on on the real estate he bought and then if he sells it for a gain he's gonna 1031 exchange it into another real estate property and pay no gains it's pretty amazing i felt like um when i learned this i felt like i was sitting like i went to a fancy dinner table for the first time they finally showed me like that small fork is meant for like taking crab meat out of the claw i was like oh that's that's for oh like well goddamn that's the kid's fork yeah i was like that was the little people i don't know what that is anyway i that was like it's just like hit me in the head i'm like duh so that was the so i had a call with a tax guy a tech strategist um i'm paying for this like tax strategist because i'm like okay where did you figure this stuff out my brother-in-law had found somebody through a thing he and he saved him a bunch of money and he was telling me about it i was like i gotta talk to this guy so i talked to him it's got jeff and um he's like okay you know so what are your goals here you know and i was like i want to learn what the rich people do to pay less taxes and then you know decide or try to do some of those things if they apply to me and he's like okay and i was like so walk me through here like if i make this much money in a year i'm just doing this i'm just writing this huge tax bill tax check you know every year what do they do where they don't have to do that and he was like just kind of like amused at my line of questioning but in the end he was like super helpful he really like kind of outlined all the things and then at the end i was like all right how does attorney-client privilege work here i was like let's just say i tell you that you know this uh this part of my house that's my home office deduction sometimes i nap there and like also i store my dog stuff there right like this unrelated to my office um i said how honest can i be with you and he goes you can be totally honest and i recommend you do but there's no attorney like rivers i can be subpoenaed he goes i'm not to do anything wrong because i don't have to you're okay great you basically just need to ask for like red light green light yellow light like now he'll be like they'll be like yeah so like are you active or passive on that i'm like suppose i was active what would the number be at the end and then suppose i was passive and then i will give you my answer by the end of this and he's like reading between the lines of like oh okay i understand we haven't even actually gotten into any of my stuff but i wanted to ask all the questions up front to him about like uh like i i'm more fascinated with how the tax thing works i don't even have like a very complicated setup there's not really anything i could do uh because i'm not like elon i don't have this like complicated structure and all these shares i can borrow against in that same structure but i'm more i'm paying this guy to tell me what other rich people do and uh i'm fine with that i think that's a great trade do you want to talk about you want to go uh i've got one idea so so i i i well uh uh you want to do mine first i mean i can give you a summary then we can get into it later yeah do yours okay do you know who paul singh is i never met him but i've heard about him and my buddy is his business partner great so paul a baby bump bump boxes bump box so yeah sorry so you'll actually know more about this than i do so i reached out to paul because uh i don't even know how i contacted him but paul singh is a guy who started this thing called 500 startups they're not really around too much anymore but yeah they didn't start it right did he start it dave mcclure yeah maybe he didn't start it but he was like there at the beginning and so uh yeah i i don't know if he helped start maybe it's the right word and he was just he was a guy there um he helped make it popular and somehow he uh started traveling in an rv that was his shtick was like i he actually left san francisco before it's cool he goes i just want to travel in an rv and years and years and years ago he started a coasting company like a web hosting company and he wouldn't talk to me about it too much because it's kind of private but he's like basically i make millions of dollars a year from cash flow from that and i invest a large amount into privately held companies both brick and mortar and tech startups every single year and i would travel just to meet new potential investments and at one point i met these folks who had this thing called bump box it wasn't very popular and so it sounds like you know the people from bump box right yeah i know it's super well oh well then you probably know a lot more than i do but let me tell you what i know so he met these folks and he bought into it um he didn't start it and he didn't buy it outright but i think he bought into it so for like two or three hundred thousand dollars something like that he bought a portion i don't know how much it was but basically the whole shtick was we know uh statistically like where you should be in your pregnancy and like the the feelings that you're gonna have and the products that you're gonna need um and so we sell you a monthly box for fifty dollars well let me simplify that part i think it's more like when you get pregnant especially for the first time there's like all these new things happening inside your body outside your body you're trying to figure stuff out and there's like a million things that you're supposed to buy and get to do but you don't know what they are and even if you know what they are you don't know which product to buy because you want to buy the one that's like safe but also effective but also whatever into a lot of reading reviews trying products and so what bumbox did which is pretty genius was they just said look we're gonna find the best products for every phase of your pregnancy first trimester second trimester third and then post and we're going to package it up into a subscription box so you're just it's just going to show up on your doorstep you don't even have to think and worry about the stuff anymore and so paul came in and he's like yeah they're doing you guys are this is okay it's pretty good i think we could think of just a tad bit bigger and we could turbo charge this and so now their vision is basically from conception to like 18 19 20 years old a mother is handling lots of different stuff and we want to be the place that she turns to for a variety of different like needs to care for her kids right and the company's pretty interesting it's like 40 million dollars in sales his goal is to grow the company 2x every single year and of that 40 million in revenue 60 is from subscription boxes and 30 is from this 30 to 40 is this other stuff and paul came into this business and he goes these boxes are great but let's just make more and more and more stuff for this person so let's figure out everything the mom needs and let's just make it and so now 30 or 40 of their business comes from medical equipment which i don't even know what that means whatever i don't know what they sell so like i don't know if they're selling this yet we might have to take this out i don't know if it's out yet but like for example uh a breast pump so when you when when you're breastfeeding you're gonna pump in between feeds or whatever and uh insurance covers it and so you know these things are expensive devices that you need medical devices that the doctor sort of gives you that you'll use for the first year or so of your pregnancy after birth and the other stuff they sell is they'll figure out that you want this and they're going to call you and one of their insurance agents are going to call you and say here's the 50 best types of insurance companies that you should check out if you want to buy this breast pump or whatever they're it's all covered by insurance and then they make a cut off that lead so kind of an interesting company um that i wanted to talk about and i wanted to talk about because there's a few things going on here first this is a guy who has made a lot of money angel investing in tech companies and he told me i never want to raise money i want to own as much as this business as i can and we can either distribute profits to ourselves and our employees or we could sell for a load of money and b i just think that it's kind of interesting it's not like it's it's out of my world that you know i don't have kids i'm not a woman uh it's kind of interesting what do you know about this um so leland who's the uh the the founder and hit leona's wife i don't remember my name top of my head but they started this thing they're amazing he's been so helpful to me in e-commerce um he really knows his and just awesome guy i think they're based in illinois or something like that and uh you know super super nice in the midwest built this company out it's kind of a great company and i think subscription is really hard to do but when you do it it's fantastic and i think they've done a pretty good job of actually actually pulling it off and the way he says that he's like we're not a box company we're a mom acquisition machine and i'm like that's absolutely right and that's why they think bigger than just what what's one product we could sell them okay box might be the first what's the second what's the third what's the fourth because we're just gonna acquire moms um at an insane insanely good rate and be able to offer them products that they're going to need for you know the period of their uh of their child you know child care time and i said to paul i go you know like this is great but you are doing a lot of stuff that i think is a bad idea but it's a great idea i mean clearly you're making it work which is you are not just stan you're not focusing exactly you're you're focusing on the mother category but you're launching loads of different stuff and he goes yeah that's actually our goal and the reason we're doing that is uh our our whole unique strategy is that we're gonna move quickly but he's like when you think about it a hundred years ago at some board meeting the guys at p e or kellogg or whatever it is the big conglomerates nowadays they go you know like look we could start building you could start selling more soap or we could just buy all the soap and then buy all the razors and just buy everything that like you possibly use in your home and own the whole category as opposed to just focusing on this one thing and even though tech focuses on this one thing let's just do the opposite and say you know why can't we build a family of companies and i thought that was pretty cool it broke my frame it's a little different than what i've heard um or what i would have done and i think it's neat to see something that's the opposite of what i like i think they did focus on getting boxes core to work for a number of years right that's not new obviously yeah so so you you buy yourself the right to try a bunch of new things by getting your core to work really really well and get to scale so i think they did that part they weren't doing i don't think five different things before the other thing is like this idea is so simple and but when you talk to leland you're like oh you're like a badass operator like he's in the nitty-gritty he's like oh yeah and facebook ads i can put i can copy paste this over here and if i do that it's like it's just a little bit better the platform doesn't even really support it but i can do it manually this way or like you know um they'll use it you know like they're when they're marketing to people they're like yeah we actually call i don't know if you've ever heard of this have you heard of like ringless voicemail no this is like this marketing tactic that he's like oh yeah we call our customers i was like don't people hate getting calls he's like oh it's not a call it goes straight to voicemail i was like what is it yeah there's a way to call somebody that goes straight to voicemail you leave a message so it's a great way to like that's staying in the email inbox and you're buried under 5000 of their emails the person might get one or two voicemails a day and one of them can be from us and people like hearing from us and they hear a voice of a human being talking to them i'm like he's just doing a thousand of those small operational wins every year and i'm like oh that's why you win because this is a simple idea that i think nine out of ten entrepreneurs who tried this same exact idea would have failed same idea a portion of it if he's a powerhouse he just needs some help early on i think they needed some capital and i think they met paul pretty impressed by him and i think he's been a good kind of partner for them but you know if you if you offered them a deal now i don't think they would take it right because he's in a different position now than when it's just like i mean he started the company him and his wife were like i think they were like at a conference or something like that and they were just like walking it was like you know like the parking lot or the water the hot dog stands like you know far away because everything's even convenient at an event and while they were walking there they basically like had this idea they're like screw it why don't we do this like let's start a business why don't we just go for it and they just like kind of decided to do it and so you know at that point you're really green you don't know anything and then now he knows obviously a lot because he's been doing this for i don't know whatever seven years or something have you heard of i'm making a quick pivot have you heard of this thing called the anti-galloway index i don't know if it's a real thing i know that a lot of people basically make fun of scott galloway for being absolutely wrong about all his investment advice and predictions so there's this guy someone turned it into an actual festival no no no um so there's this guy named scott galloway scott galloway i've had lunch with him he's been nothing but nice to me but a lot of people dislike him because he makes some crazy statements he's um they tease him for being real woke he makes these predictions where he puts like the my the winners and losers of each year and he makes these really bold predictions yeah and a lot of people attack and a lot of people in general make fun of them because his predictions i mean i'm sure some of them are right but like a lot of them are wrong like really wrong massively wrong like one time he said that macy's is gonna crush amazon and that's just an example and some who i love made a thing called the anti-galloway index and if you so basically if you would have done the opposite of everything he said since 2019 uh tech companies that professor galloway has predicted would fail have outperformed the s p 500 by a whopping 61 percent no no they've outperformed as you've heard and have the return itself is 61 percent sorry you know during the time and you know even if you it says even if you exclude tesla which was one of his big bets that he said was fail and it took off and said even without that one still 23 percent uh return that's crazy isn't it this is hilarious who made this let's give him a shot i don't know okay that's hilarious this is cool uh yeah let's so okay here's the idea by the way which is um is there i think there is there's some new products that are coming out that let anybody create a basket of stocks that's like like for example i think there's a company called doji that's doing this doji and what they do is uh you can go cr i can go create the sean index and it's five stocks that i'm investing in and you can actually put your money into my index and buy it buy those stocks and then it'll show over time how my index is performed um and i can make the tech index and i can make my like high-risk high-reward index or whatever that's my understanding i haven't used the product but my understanding is it's kind of like that which i think is an awesome idea by the way what do you think of that idea yeah i mean why can't you do that on um i i've mentioned him before i think it's called like bull bull something there's that one uh there's a one israeli robin hood uh competitor and they've done this it's called copy trader and you can create weeble is that what it is um and you could do this on that platform i think it's sick i think it's awesome yeah it seems really cool i don't know if i get some incentive by like sharing my basket but that would be like a really cool model where essentially i get a small cut of the assets that are invested into it if we perform or something like that and and then you can see like who's right who's wrong and not just people who cherry pick oh i invested in this one thing and it's done great but they don't tell you about the five losers they had here it's like all on the record what you what you picked and then you know you can see like the gallow index uh i think it's amazing so you want to talk about some of your ideas uh yeah sure uh which one do you want to do so uh have you heard about this phantom secure thing i thought this was pretty sweet no so um okay so there was a story the other day about the fbi had this huge crackdown on criminals and i was like okay that's interesting tell me about it and so i was reading it and in there they were talking about this um the story okay so there was this app called phantom secure and phantom secure was it was marketed basically as a as an app that you can use if you don't want you know anybody to see what you're writing here right so obviously criminals are like hey that's interesting i'd rather right there than on gmail right where my stuff is stored on a server somewhere and i can get you know those those records can get subpoenaed or whatever and so phantom secure at its peak had 20 000 users um it would make 80 million dollars off those 20 000 users so just like math because you would pay to use it right because for you you're like this is a business tool for me if i'm a criminal uh i need secure messaging i'll pay for this and so they were making four thousand dollars per user and just for like comparison whatsapp makes like two dollars per user so you know four thousand dollars per user was it's like an enterprise product for criminals but why were they paying for that versus like the other things like telegram or whatever it is because this was even more secure what you were getting here is you're not just getting an app you're getting a phone that has been wiped all the uh all the other apps are gone there's only a secure messaging app on the phone that secure messaging app will self-destruct under certain conditions if you're like you know arrested or you trigger it or whatever somebody misses that mess up the password three times so it's a like it's a burner device designed for criminal communications cto gets arrested um the only way you could even get into the app was through referral right so so this thing existed they arrested the guy and criminals were like oh we don't have this app anymore so the fbi these i don't know the story is like these two detectors were out to lunch one day and they're like why don't we create another phantom secure but we own the thing we own the bag channel so they created this app called anon like anonymous and they put it on 12 000 phones it took and they let it be out there for 18 months for criminals to use and start to trust and refer other criminals onto it and the whole time every message is going to the fbi secure servers but they just waited they just let the thing spread like a virus all throughout the criminal organizations and then they just took everybody down and i was like that is a badass story how did you find that props i don't know i saw this story and i just clicked it it's amazing so do you think okay so i think that i actually think this is amazing idea by the way it sucks that people were using it that way but i i think it's an amazing idea kind of like silk road is like an amazing idea where it's like yeah like it's cool to create like a marketplace where you can sell anything but it's kind of shitty like i don't want to support anything where like right now who are the people that want a marketplace that'll sell them anything even different stuff than i can sell on ebay oh right you know drug dealers in it like you know assassins it's like weapons like i'm not like in favor of actually everything you know i'm not actually a true libertarian because i do think that like some stuff should be illegal right right um but i am incredibly bullish on things like what's it called the so there's duckduckgo do you see duckduckgo they just took took a bunch of funding i didn't see that no yeah they sold 100 million dollars worth of um secondary shares and they're doing over 100 million in revenue right and then also do you know proton is it called protonmail right the the laughing so the funny thing is all these ideas i remember hearing about like duckduckgo six years ago i remember reading about it being like oh that's kind of weird like i thought it was like huge does anyone care like do people really care oh no it doesn't seem like they care move on protonmail signal all these apps and then they were right their core insight which is that people are gonna care about privacy people are gonna care about not being tracked by big tech companies not being advertised to and they're going to care about not having their all their messages stored forever in a way that could get leaked or hacked and uh you know you get cancelled or you get your business secrets you know outed like sony did right and so all those ended up being true and at the time and for years they looked like non-winners people weren't really using them at the time i totally agree i thought it was stupid i'm like doctor go what are you talking about now i uh it's my it's my it's what i use you use that as your default uh uh i use it often and i'm starting to use that as default yeah and um do you use brave because brave is the new one that i think fits into this category break brown no i haven't yet because switching from chrome is shockingly challenging right but switching from anything switching from mail messaging they're all they're all google's a bit easier is it why like switching my search thing yeah oh i mean i could probably get good results on bing or google i mean i i i i'm just really trying to go to the wikipedia or quora or facebook or twitter right i'm pretty i'm pretty sure that uh private browsing basically you know like a brave brave or a brave like company five years from now we're gonna look at it and it's gonna be just like duckduckgo or signal um in that like it just takes over slowly but surely i agree and i think that ten years from now we're gonna say like i can't believe you used to use x y and z and you would just do that like that's shocking to me right you used to just give up your location to to anybody to be advertised to right you used to like alexa right you used to just have like a hot mic on in your house all the time right so those are going to seem like strange strangers the other day if you didn't listen we had this guy named mike maples on and he was kind of a genius and he was he talked about inflections and he's like what i i invest in early stage stuff and it's pretty impossible to predict what's going to be big so i try to use some frameworks and i just basically think like you know what interesting things what interesting inflections are going to happen in 10 years that's going to make x y and z possible but it's not possible right now and i'm going to try and get into it so like for example uh uber what made it possible was everyone started having really great phones that had gps's in it without those gps's it would have been very challenging to do this right and one of those inflections that i believe to be true and i'm trying to put my money where my mouth is and invest stuff like it is this privacy thing i believe that that i believe that to be true i believe that's going to be a big thing coming up i don't know who's going to win or what the uh what the end result will look like but i believe right right you know what to look for and you know what's going to look strange now right we talked about guardian that app on your phone that like it's like a auto vpn for for your mobile apps brave browser i think fits into that you know when mike maples was on he said something really fast that i thought was actually super insightful that we didn't really go into he goes he goes every like kind of era of tech um the old valuable thing becomes like completely commoditized and there becomes a new valuable thing so what does that mean so he goes you know back when it was like at first you were selling pcs and all the money to be made was in the hardware and then you had like microsoft and others basically come up and they're like cool ibm you be the hardware we're gonna be the software and then like all the money shifted from being made into hardware to the hardware became completely commoditized and all the money was made in software applications and then it was like oh software applications are you know like where all the money's made and then people started making services like google and facebook it's like wait it's a free software application so then how do you make money it's like because data data's the valuable thing you don't realize that right microsoft doesn't realize that they're going to charge you for the software we're going to give away free software but we're going to make all the money on the data and it's like okay great and the shift that's happening now is that data is the thing that makes money we're gonna make our data open open source we're gonna make our blockchain open anybody can build on top of it and uh we're gonna go open data so then where's all the money to be made and then you have like kind of like a new answer that comes after that and so i thought that was like such a spot-on observation and it's like that's how you observe that's how the next you know 100 billion 500 billion dollar company looks nothing like the last one if you're just looking to match what's the next microsoft you're never going to think it's facebook this college social network that's free right you're never gonna think it's google the search engine that's free you're gonna think it's supposed to look more like more like microsoft this like enterprise paid software thing but no it keeps switching because they they react to it in that way and so like that's why you know i got kind of made fun of when i was talking about bitcloud but big cloud i think is an example of this where they took the most valuable part of facebook and twitter which is the social graph and the data that's uh that's underneath it and they were like nope that's going to be freely available anybody can take our data you can make a better version of big cloud you can like you can make a new skin make a new client you can make a fork off this the data is all open open chain which facebook would never give you access to their database that shows you every person their photos and their friends you can never get access like that it's their most prized possession and big cloud basically says that's now free instead we're going to make our money on these crater coins right a different method i think that you've said a lot of amazing stuff for the past two years i think this little rant right here might be the most like not valuable in the sense of like whenever you talk about like fluffy that's useful of like i need to have confidence yeah like that is useful i call it fluffy but it's incredibly useful i think what you just said right there actually might be one of the most valuable rants in terms of just money that you've ever said i think that um i think that i do not have the ability to build pretty much any of the things that you're discussing i don't you might have the ability but i certainly don't i don't think you do either but i think that if you are listening to this and you think you have the ability to do some of this some of this stuff i think like there you we've very clearly just said a thesis of what like the world's gonna be like in 10 years and i would bet my own personal money that that actually is going to be true and i think it's going to be um not just true little but like true a significant amount right and there's not just one trend happening at once right like i remember talking to alex to the founder of calm and he just believed that like mindfulness and being and you know calm and meditation was going to become a bigger thing and there was multiple years where it was not getting it was not growing very fast because it wasn't a thing and then sure enough people started to feel really fatigued with technology they started to feel really busy and constantly on and the mobile phone was too much and then wow there's this app that like is actually designed not for me to constantly use it and check it keep checking the notifications over and over and over again this app is to calm me down and mindfulness and mental health became a thing and it's like yeah mental health became a thing and he was prepared he was ready with a solution for that that he had been baking for years yeah so i i think it's bullish or bullish i think it's amazing i think it's gonna be a thing you want to do a couple more you want to do this chick-fil-a thing so i read this i read this blog post this article that the chick-fil-a tech team put out and um if i'm not the biggest chick-fil-a customer i'm top five easily in the country so uh you know so anything chick-fil-a i'm gonna read and what they were talking about was like chick-fil-a using ai machine learning blah blah and i was like oh let me see what this is some and i started reading it it was actually pretty interesting first of all 90 of it was just over my head but i thought it was pretty fascinating what they were saying well first two things they kind of like they put their stake in the ground which i appreciate they go chick-fil-a is you know a restaurant that's sort of different than others we're only open six days a week but we do more sales than people that are open seven days a week i was like baller like strive to be chick-fil-a you know like i want to be the chick-fil-a i want to work less and make more uh than somebody who's working more and the you know the other thing i thought about was like a lot of people hate chick-fil-a because they're like kind of like overly christian and like have like like anti-gay marriage and stuff like that um and i'm like oh that sucks but like this chicken is so good i'm gonna eat here you know like the chicken wins and then what i would always say it's like i can like r kelly's voice but not like him like i can admit that i believe i could fly is like a banger and also say he's a horrible human being also you're not invited to my daughter's birthday party yeah like i could do hope it is possible to do both and so with chick-fil-a it's like i want to stuff my mouth with chicken and then be like you guys you guys are wrong you know like that's how i want to be so anyways i'm i'm like you want to be like chick-fil-a a product so good that you can actually be batshit crazy or even offensive and still the person who disagrees with you they need your product it's that good it's must-have so then they were talking about their tech and they were like well our stores when we designed them we thought they were only going to handle like let's say just for simplicity say 100 orders 100 customers a day or whatever but the actual usage the demand is so high for chick-fil-a that we get three times more output than the store was designed for and he's like so how do we do that right once you design the store it's kind of it's already built you can't really go back and change it so we've had to use technology to get 3x the output that the thing was designed to do it goes so the first thing we tried to do was can we like predict demand better right so if you want to pump orders out faster instead of waiting until after the order happens i should i should just say hey there's always a lunch rush at noon so i'm going to throw a bunch of fries in and i'm just gonna know that i get this much demand he goes but the problem is there's too many variables you know a soccer game ends nearby you get a rush of customers the weather changes and that causes a dip in customers um you know there's too much traffic on the highway that's caused the dip so it's too unpredictable you can't just say fridays at noon are always gonna have this much demand um too many external variables but he goes so what we did do instead was we put like hundreds of sensors inside of a store so that in real time i'm basically taking the you know like the order as the person's typing it into the to the machine and that's that's uh being matched with a sensor that tells us how active the fry machine is and then it gives a signal to the worker to basically like hey dude put more fries in there's going to be more demand or whatever right like they're taking all these signals and how many people are in the drive-through times this times that and basically making predictions of what do they need to make so that they can get that extra 20 of orders done per hour for throughput and so i thought this was kind of interesting and i don't even fully understand the model and i'm kind of like i'm kind of like um what's like it's not like mansplaining i'm like dumbsplaining like the thing i just said is not actually what they do but it's the essence of what they do uh which is they take a whole they have a hundred hundred like sort of smart devices like what this whole podcast is is we just said like they just it just it just bump boxes all they do is they just sell that like i mean need that's all right they're not like expert at facebook ads or experts at like deal making for like supply chain stuff i mean they just do that right so so the point is there's like 100 smart devices in the chick-fil-a that are feeding into a machine learning algorithm to put something out there so that a front-line worker who makes i don't know 16 an hour is able to be more effective and they're able to get more source more sales per square foot and so i started thinking like first of all i had no idea that like kind of old-school companies like chick-fil-a are that deep into like adding technology into their stores and their services and it made me think two for two ideas the first is those people should spin the engineers working on that should spin out of chick-fil-a and then go offer this as a service to every other restaurant is basically like hey chick-fil-a spent 50 million dollars over the last five years developing the technology to make their store smarter um so we generalized it and it's a product for you right that's my my old export framework they should export this idea from chick-fil-a and make it available to any any restaurant chain so that's like the first idea the second idea is what are the companies that are like mckinsey or like a consulting company because i assume chick-fil-a when they go out in the job market they're trying to hire machine learning and ai engineers i bet they're finding it pretty hard to compete with like google and facebook and open ai and all these other companies like what what great engineer is going to work for chick-fil-a right like i think you'd be surprised um you know who who crushed it with um tech stuff or relatively speaking was walmart um walmart had this amazing thing called the walmart innovation lab in silicon valley yep it was pretty sick and i went to um i was reading the other day about the most beloved brands amongst young people and it's like uh target it's like vans starbucks one other one and like the number one most loved brand is chick-fil-a right so fair enough graduate is going to work for chick-fil-a and they're cutting against the grain but i think most people are going to go towards more traditional brands which really told me the way most companies are going to solve this is not by having as much in-house tech talent as consultants that basically take good tech talent but like hyper hyper charge them to get them to go faster and so i'm curious i bet this exists but i'm curious who's building like a mckenzie type of company like a badass consulting company that is only tech consulting it's hardcore engineer it's engineering specifically around like the new age stuff of machine learning and ai and i think that you could build a new mackenzie deloitte pwc that is basically when your company needs tech when your company needs tech answers you basically hire this high price consulting firm that comes in and these guys are not suits that are great talkers these are and make great pitch decks these are engineers who come in and they actually build and they teach your team how to build and they build themselves i know that mentor or all these guys offer that you think they do offer it but i think their brand is not branded as this and so i think there's an opportunity to come in and say we dress differently we talk differently we don't even do we don't have these 10 other offerings that mckinsey has we are actually the best if you really want to hire the best when it comes to engineering you know all of our guys are straight out of facebook google stanford harvard uh that's our crew and these everybody's got a computer science degree you know this is our ceo look he's a nerd he's got cheeto dust on his shirt like that's who you're dealing with here um whereas today i know that mckinsey and others are like offering offering these as part of their services and in addition to like tax planning and like 10 other things that they're gonna do you know like financial audits and like other so i think there's an opportunity to create like a big four type of consulting company if you just went all in on engineers i'm on i'm on board i think it's cool i i think that any engineer who's smart though would never want to start this business because that would be hard as but i do think that um there's so many cool things that started as agencies that eventually they create their own software and it becomes badass so for example i do think it would be cool to do this for five ten years and then eventually just make the software and you could become it would be a really easy way or not easy straightforward way to have a bootstrap software company so have you ever heard of consensus no what is it so consensus is a uh it's it's a tr it's a version of this um it's in the crypto space so it was started by this guy joe lubin who was like one of the first kind of like six guys backing uh ethereum so he was like he was like ethereum pre-launch i think he was one of the main funding sources essentially he came from the finance world and uh he believed in ethereum and so he he's known as one of the co-founders of ethereum guy basically became a billionaire off of ethereum takes the ability he takes that he basically spins off ethereum launches and instead of sticking with the ethereum foundation he creates consensus consensus is like we have an office in new york la shanghai whatever right like tokyo whatever they like kind of a traditional consulting model and um but they weren't just doing consulting but what they do is they they had like in-house projects so for example metamask which is like the most popular ethereum wallet i think that's built into a browser uh was like either incubated there or they like kind of like found the guy who built it and brought him into consensus and that was one of their projects um but they basically they make like they'll go to like mastercard or visa and be like you guys keep hearing about blockchain right don't you need like just a group of blockchain like specialists who can come and teach your company how how you should be using blockchains and we'll consult with you that will build projects for you and like we'll be kind of this like hybrid like agency incubator consulting company type of thing and they do like i think they said they forecasted like 60 million of revenue in 2021. um now i should say i personally think consensus is kind of a shitty company they hired like a thousand people uh i don't think they had like the business fundamentals to support any of that um you know so so i don't think consensus itself is gonna be that successful but that's an example of somebody who said cool all of the fortune 500 is interest is curious and interested in this new age technology we can brand ourselves as the like de facto group of if you're a big fortune 500 come talk to us and we're about blockchain this this consensus company's nuts started just recently right oh no 2014. yeah it started right after ethereum they do did this guy joseph lubin's help create ethereum yeah like i said he he was basically one of the big kind of like financial backers early on and kind of helped when they were pre-launched he was involved when there was like you know this group of seven or eight people that were helping build it and they each had a different role this is creating in such a more short time is crazy like do you know that one guy um okay so what was that disney movie called like the secret service kid or uh the first kid you remember first kid okay yeah i don't know where you're going okay you remember that movie remember the kid actor uh i don't remember mike he was also in the movie um mighty ducks oh which one was he in mighty dex um i don't actually know what he was in my what the name was but his name's brock pierce okay do you know who brock pierce is he's also in sinbad yeah well no sinbad was the uh the the lead secretary security guard first kid okay remember i remember this movie i love this movie yeah it's great right okay this guy's name is brock pierce he's a bitcoin billionaire now what yeah dude google brock pierce so he was a kid in mighty ducks he plays young gordon bombay so he's not one of the the kids he's he's the flashback of gordon bombay as a kid yeah but he was like a well-known actor like he was in um first kid was a thing he was in little big league he just did all like the 90s like kid movies yeah every movie everyone if you if you are born in um in the 80s you recognize who this kid is if you're 31 like me and sam then you uh you recognize who this guy is dude google him he's a bit he was worth like a billion dollars hilarious you'll recognize him he's got he's a bitcoin crypto guy he wears that stupid hat he wears a stupid hat now that's just google i go to images go get brock pierce oh okay yeah i've seen him is that yeah he's a stupid hat leather vest guy like that's what he wears he goes to puerto rico dude that guy is a is a billionaire now because he was in on crypto in like uh 12 13 14. he's like he's okay i need to i need all those royalties from the first kid we're putting it into eth we'll put it in the east crown cell let's do this it's just the amount of wealth that this is has created and so quickly it's just crazy um it's just it's fun it's such a fun story but brock pierce the first kid gordon bombay when he was a kid whatever the guy's name was he's a bitcoin billionaire billy of the week that's it two of my favorite things two of my favorite things in my life were mighty ducks and bitcoin and uh this guy's involved with both of them now i don't know but on i read his wikipedia the other day he's got like some shady going on where i mean obviously you kind of look at him he kind of screams shady but he like his partner was like raping kids i mean it was pretty up and like if your partner's doing that i'm not saying you're guilty but i'm saying like you probably like are involved like yeah like where there's smoke there's fire type of thing it's kind of weird to me and uh so there's like a this guy's got a lot of this guy's going to be like the modern day mcafee you know like yeah he's just max v he's like he became a billionaire and then also like uh like did some crazy in uh botswana or where the he went that's what this guy's gonna do but anyway brock pierce crazy right that's crazy um okay by the way i also have this a little calculator in excel that i should publish which is will the winklevox get the winklevoss twins get the last laugh which is what does the price of bitcoin need to be for them to end up wealthier than mark zuckerberg for taking and taking their idea and making facebook and uh and then i thought about it i was like i wonder if zuck just owned some bitcoin as a hedge to be like you'll never you'll never pass me but i don't think he's got that petty streak i'm thinking about selling my facebook stock because i think like i've totally done 180 i think facebook's whack as now but uh why it's just lame like who uses that now i mean twitter's just kicking it's just whack and instagram i think is even stupid now i love how you're like who uses that like a billion people could raise their hand and be like me every day multiple times a day i just think that um it's just lame i think tic toc is so much better and more positive i like it more um but i think that um zuck is someone i would never bet like i just think that he's just the greatest in terms of did you see the video of him spear hunting recently no what is he doing oh dude you gotta google this uh google mark zuckerberg spear and there's this video so he like went hunting or whatever he went on a hunting trip i think that might be separate then he's like at this little like kind of like a throwing range and there's like a giant target and then you see mark zuckerberg in slo-mo running up at it with a spear and then launching the spear and getting a bullseye in the target and it's just like it's everything you would expect out of a zuckerberg video which is like you know two parts awkward robotic one part like sort of fearsome and weird at the same time i'm yeah i'm looking at it now i mean this is just yeah wow he got it by the way you said tick tock you should um follow this tic-tac account it's amazing it's called vitalik doing things so vitalik who's the co-founder of ethereum he's also like zuck like hilariously awkward i really love the guy i think he's like when he talks yeah he might have like kind of an awkward way of talking but i love his thoughts i love his brain basically he seems like a very genuine guy um he doesn't just like shill ethereum and like crypto and say it's the best thing ever and all that like he's just like way more reasonable and clearly like mission driven i'm looking at it now his story is kind of amazing by the way like what's he like like an adopted russian kid or something do you do you know how this guy like got started in crypto no he's 18 years old he like discovers crypto he starts by just he agrees to write free article or write articles for bitcoin magazine back when bitcoin was like super underground at the time and you know bitcoin magazine paid him 3.50 per article and he's like writing all about bitcoin and like all the cool things you're going to be able to do with cryptocurrencies he's just like a kid and he used to like go to different crypto projects and meet them and be like hey i'd love to like help or like intern or like kind of like write about you guys and he started just getting known as kind of like this little blogger boy and then like little blogger boy goes on to like he helped write the white paper for one idea uh called colored coins that was like gonna be for this other project and then eventually decides like you know what like i have all these ideas about how i think crypto could change the world like i'm just going to make it myself i'm going to make ethereum and so he invents ethereum at like age 18 or 19 and like is the youngest crypto billionaire in the world um since where's the name come from russia what's that mean oh no oh i don't know why you named it ethereum um ether is like kind of like it's sort of like i don't know if you know what ether is it's sort of like this um it's like out of the ether it's like this like it's like the substance of the war it's basically i don't know how you describe ether really it's like a it's like matter it's like it's like a word like matter uh in the universe and so i don't know why he called it ether i think it was like i don't know i don't know the backstory i should really speculate well you should have figured that out i thought you're like betting your life savings on this um i saw i took one look at this guy and i was like i'm gonna hitch my wagon to this nerd this this guy's taking me to the top i think that's a good i think that's a good bet to be honest but the tick tock channel vitalik doing things is amazing comedy um because he's just a very unintentionally comedic guy dan posted it so he goes i immediately realized that i liked it better than all the other alternatives that i'd seen i suppose it was fact that it sounded nice and it had the word ether referring to the hypothetical invisible medium that permeates the universe and allows light to travel right yeah that's the guy you want to bet on all right i think that's the show right yeah that's it i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back

let's say everybody's selling banana you can't say i'm a 5x better banana you instead you should come out and say i'm an apple and not everybody's gonna want your apple but a hundred percent of the people who prefer apples are gonna want what you have i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like my days off on the road let's travel never looking back all right uh yeah sean this um i i was playing this podcast pretty good um how'd you feel um it was good it was like we showed up no no context like what are we going to talk about do i need to do i need to talk about bitcoin do i need to have something smart to say about bitcoin because i kind of just you know i believe i buy i hold right i'm like a monkey in this space i'm not like you know one of these experts but um but we talked about solo biggest solo capitalist solopreneur and uh some of the different kind of like things around that so i thought i thought it was actually pretty good conversation ben was there and he was like i liked this one because i feel like everything you said in this was something new that i had never heard you say before he's like whereas you know once you listen to somebody for like hundreds of hours you kind of hear the same greatest hits over and over again he's like this felt like new stuff speaking of listening to us for hundreds of hours or listening to you at least we had a good episode we just interviewed this guy named mike maples mike was pretty cool so mike is a little under the radar but he started this thing called floodgate which is a really big venture capital firm but really fascinating guy what what all have they done they've done lyft twitch um twitter crews octa which is like a giant enterprise company that's public so yeah a bunch of bunch of big winners that he was an investor in pretty early considered um one of the best venture capital firms there is so real insightful guy he kind of had a hint of biology a little bit uh i mean he was like real high iq i've been using the word high functioning um he's like a real high functioning he was a high functioning southerner right he had this disarming way of talking because he's got this you know kind of like is this southern or midwestern accent yeah and uh you know very very relatable likable guy but then the things he was saying each one was like you know like sort of a bullet into you know of an idea of an insight and he definitely had like a few refined ideas of where he thinks the puck is going and i appreciate that i like that he gave us basically these four waves he's like you know i believe these four inflections are happening right now and that's going to create a bunch of opportunity and that's what i look for is like how is the world changing and then what's what's going to be new because of these inflection points yeah i was taking notes the four things are blockchain cloud office american x the cloud culture for consumers so those are like the four things and we went into like we didn't actually go into each one entirely but he talked a little bit about each one and we delved uh we went deep into cloud office and he talked about the opportunities there i thought it was great what do you think i loved it i loved the way he had some phrases for things i thought at the beginning he was like a little bit too intellectual for me i was like okay wait where do i go with this but um it was interesting but i didn't know how to attach it to like a concrete idea and then i thought about you know that was maybe the first 25 and then the next 75 i thought were fantastic where um yeah it came down to earth and also he has these this is kind of amazing way of talking i'm kind of jealous dude you are like that i know but i i because i like because i try to be like that when i see somebody who's really good at it i'm like oh [ __ ] you're good at this thing most people don't even care about this thing he had these little phrases coined terms for either himself or his fund or his philosophy or his mental models and uh you know he'd be like you know startup is like a jazz band not a marching band and then he would explain the analogy and then he was like he was like i want people to choose not compare which is hard to understand but once he explains it then it's like oh that's actually a wonderful mental framework it's like that kanye song where it's like what does it mean it's like i don't know what it means but it sounds provocative and that's how i felt with a lot of his things was like effort i was like and immediately interested i leaned in when he would say one of those phrases even though my brain hadn't figured out exactly what it means yet and then he would explain it so anyways i thought it was really good and super nice dude i really thought he came you know he's so humble uh and and very likable so i don't know great episode i i liked him a lot i agree and he offered to come back i couldn't tell if like when guys are being nice i'm like well if you have time let's just keep going all right i couldn't tell if he was being kind we'll have to have him back on uh he was awesome right uh how did you feel about uh when you hit him up for some intros there was that smooth uh i thought it was pretty smooth yeah you gave him the opportunity to be a hero and if not it was totally okay yeah i asked him i'm gonna start asking every guest that the the question i'm gonna start asking is uh who do you think would be an awesome guess like who would be good for those podcasts and then uh what do you think's the best way to get in touch with them right and then they have the opportunity to be like yeah just reach out he's a nice guy or yeah let me just shoot him a note right now i'll tell him uh i'll intro you guys right i thought that was a great angle i know i wanted to call it out because people are listening uh they get this sort of behind the scenes of as i heard you say it i was like oh smooth smooth guy sam going for the intro we didn't get the kill on this time but uh we got i i feel as though i've we've built enough rapport with him i can out email mike and maybe he'll help he'll hook it up but yeah he did a good job there we go so mike do you um i was connected to you because my friend my good friend noah kagan was like you gotta holler at this guy he's pretty interesting and i've known about you as well because tim ferriss um lived near me and was a friend of mine and he told me that he's like there's like two people or three people whose advice i listen to when it comes to investing one is naval the founder of angellist who is scott belski who started the hands and is now probably going to be the ceo of adobe and three was you yeah okay and i was like that's kind of interesting you know i i have not really heard of mike too much you know you're kind of you kind of you kind of keep a a low profile and i looked it up and so you started floodgate which eventually you guys have messed it in like twitter twitch lyft all types of amazing stuff but we so we have this podcast show tonight it's pretty popular um you know millions of people listen and all we do is just brainstorm interesting ideas and so we thought you know we got to get you on to come and talk about some stuff and so here we are let's give it a shot why not thanks for having me and by the way i've listened to your podcast uh a bunch of times i remember the the in the episode with the with kevin systrom from instagram is okay one of my favorite ones so uh what's the exact thing is starting starting greatness or starting starting greatness yeah starting greatness and it's it's kind of a labor of love you know i uh uh some of the people that work at floodgate occasionally we'd have some hallway conversation or in a meeting they're like dude i wish we could have recorded that right so so in many ways the the guests not only help with the the content but but we're trying to help help the some of the key ideas of starting greatness come alive through the voices of the guests because i think there are some some counter-intuitive lessons of starting a great startup that are not obvious to people right and you have a you have a good voice and then b your intros are great on the pod you uh it always has like i don't know how much time you spend on that but uh the intros are great compared to us we put we're sort of famous for we barely do an intro like you'll be 10 minutes in and be like who the hell is this guest and then um you know sometimes at the end we do the sort of irish goodbye where we're like okay that's it we just sort of like we end it we go about our day and so people have like started making fun of us making shirts about the the irish goodbye because they're like dude i also hate saying goodbyes it's it's you know i hate the unwind of a conversation i like how you guys just leave and and so that's that's kind of our thing um but what we want i guess i want to start with we could talk about kind of like all the great stuff you've invested in uh but i guess i'm more curious about what's get what's got you excited now what space is what trends are you seeing where you're like huh i don't fully i don't fully know what's there but uh there's enough there for me to be interested yeah and it might be kind of a good segue into how i think about what the next big thing will be because there's this there's this thing that i say to founders which is very encounter it's very counterintuitive i say if you want to start a great startup don't try to think of a startup and uh the reason for that is that great startup founders are like time travelers and they they get out of the present and they visualize different futures that are a breakthrough that break free from the present and when you try to think of a startup right now you tend to orient yourself in the world of the present and so you tend to come up with incremental conventional ideas rather than breakthrough ideas that sort of change the arc of the present to a different future and so um and that gets the areas that i'm interested in so what i what i encourage founders to think about are what are the inflections what are the waves of change they're going to be so massive that uh it's gonna allow an entrepreneur to change the subject about the future because on some level these waves are the gathering power it's like all the power of the ocean when you surf uh you you gotta catch the right wave to have a chance to do great things and uh it's these waves or these inflections they allow the entrepreneur to wage asymmetric warfare on the present only with big inflections does an entrepreneur go from being uh disadvantaged to incumbents to having a fundamental advantage vis-a-vis incumbents and so then in terms of the areas that i'm interested in i tend to go with the inflections and so um one inflection i'm interested in obviously is uh the blockchains uh with crypto uh i think that if i was starting a startup today that's probably where i would spend most of my time another another area of interest for me is um the the transition from what i like to call office culture to cloud culture and so in the past the cloud was sort of more of a delivery mechanism uh and a business model for application software but now what we see happening is that um the the you know microsoft office literally is a metaphor of the office and it's files and memos and file drawers and that's what our desktop looks like but now people you know it's it's not the editor that matters as much anymore as the comment system and the versioning it's kind of more like github meets knowledge work and so you know when you when you have cloud culture rather than office culture you you can take advantage of a lot of arbitrage time arbitrage talent arbitrage geography arbitrage you know that very tim ferriss you know we talked about him a little bit earlier uh and then the other thing that i'm interested in is um what i loosely refer to as america next and so on some level i think that 2020 was the first real year of the 20th century or 21st century and why is that uh i think that there were a lot of uh issues that uh people were paying lip service to uh a lot of stagnation that people were paying lip service to and i think that 2020 helped people understand uh our military needs to become more agile and more tech forward that our research and drugs and drug discovery that our ability to get uh life-saving remedies to market faster we need to take seriously there's just you know china as a geopolitical uh challenger and so as a result i think that um there and you know now people talk about buildback better but i just believe fundamentally the united states the western world are going to decide they need to invest for real in tech forward infrastructure and then on the flip side of that they're going to realize our infrastructure is vulnerable to cyber hackers and ransomware and things like that whether it's organized by rogue gangs or nation states so so those are i'd say those three areas plus also i'd say uh cloud culture applied to consumer which some call the metaverse but those are those are the main things that i'm chasing right now and you know obviously i have a lot of colleagues as well at floodgates so we you know we go after cyber security and uh cloud infrastructure and other things but the areas that i described are the ones that i'm most accurate most actively going after for that cloud office one what what products are you looking at that excite you yeah so i'll kind of give you an example so um one company i'm involved with is called almanac and uh it allows uh teams of people to create documents but like if you think about it um this has already happened in uh code and in design so in code you had github and in the past you just had code snippets that you shipped around and had some version control but github made code social and you could branch and fork and uh you know collaborate as a team at the center rather than as an afterthought and then figma did the same thing with design right so figma and so so what what we believe is that in a world where talent can live anywhere in the world it's going to matter more that you write things down and get consensus and part of how you get consensus is you have a paradigm that's not office centric in documentation but it's cloud-centric and so you know why shouldn't you just like github be able to branch and merge and fork documents and be able to within that one document know every version of that document that every ever existed and everybody's and you know if somebody forks it and uses it let's say it's an employee handbook if somebody uses it for their next company why not want to know that as well and so uh but but that's just one of many examples of where i believe that in the future you're going to have all these different products that uh presuppose that people will collaborate you know what else do i think will happen i think people will say if it can go in the cloud it should if it can be asynchronous it should because if i put things in the cloud and make them asynchronous i can take advantage of all those different forms of arbitrage to run my company better whereas if i'm a meeting centric culture i have to be in the room where it happened when a decision got made and i just think that that's an outmoded way of thinking about things in today's world what so sean and i are similar or almost the same age we or we are the same age we um like when we started work i mean we use google docs right away but you're a little bit older than us and like that would that was a you probably didn't i mean that was kind of kind of interesting to you right when that when that first came around so when you say like what needs to be in the cloud in my head i'm like wait are you kidding me isn't everything already like that what specifically are you for example there's there's startups that are doing like virtual office so they're like great everybody's remote you have all these advantages remote what do you miss out on you miss out on being able to socialize and get to know each other and build trust outside of the you know the water cooler the what you the conversations that used to happen in the break room so there's these crazy startups that are saying basically like like online town and stuff like that that are like here's a virtual office you can literally walk around you can bump into people i don't know if any of these work right but they're like taking stabs at trying to move the like physical office into the cloud too sam so it's not just docs are in the cloud but hanging out is in the cloud right co-workers in the hallways in the cloud yeah and the problem with most cloud offerings today is that they're basically re-hosted office culture right so like zoom zoom is a meeting but it's a meeting online it's not like it's asynchronous in any way it's not it you're just re-hosting the meeting rather than redefining how work happens now with zoom you can take advantage of geography arbitrage i suppose so that is a good thing but you're not able to take advantage of time and talent arbitrage as easily but like like what i what i believe ends up happening at the limit is in in office culture everybody has a job description and uh and what i think in cloud culture you know people have already talked about this but this idea of uh jobs to be done theory and so like when you think about it all of us don't just have one job all of us do a whole bunch of jobs like if you take even a very simple example let's say that i work at a flower shop i might type things into the computer to manage customer records i might take reservations and orders i might some parts of the day arrange the flowers well when you really think about it the principle of comparative advantage would suggest that any parts of that any of those jobs to be done that could be done asynchronously or in the cloud you should try to do that if you can because then you could take advantage of labor arbitrage time arbitrage and geography arbitrage and then if i'm a great flower arranger that's what i should be spending my time on is the thing that i'm really good at and so what i think cloud culture lets people do at the limit is um broadcast their comparative advantage to the world and uh get paid by the network for giving the network what it wants so i think that it'll you know the reason i call it cloud culture as well is who says everybody has to work at a company right like people said that robots are gonna eat the jobs but i think that's precisely the opposite of what's true i think that software is going to reduce the need for people to think they need to work at companies because it's going to all the things i would have had to possess to to have a job i'm not gonna need those things anymore uh by working at a company i'm gonna be able to have all those things in software on my own and so i think more and more people are gonna people are gonna realize that really there is a uh aggregate of jobs that people do and all of them could be thought of as like almost like a derivative that can be assembled in different ways and then move to the cloud or you know let you specialize and i think that that'll over time change the fundamental culture of how teams work and tell me if i misunderstand this but i think one thing that you just said in there is that this idea that one person belongs to one firm is potentially now an outdated and uh you know sub-optimal idea that instead you said like a user basically contributes to the network and gets paid for that contribution to the network and so one person might belong to multiple firms and you know firm might change so so what does that look like you're the time traveler yes let's say we fast forward 10 years uh smart guy like me how does my like today you know my company got acquired by twitch i got a day job at twitch uh you know great that's that's you know something i do and i you know before code thanks for your efforts there by the way i mean we we monetized that a little while ago but thanks for your efforts of course anything i can do for you by the way uh a vc is saying we monetize that is a wonder that that's a really cool flex i'm gonna i'm gonna feel that so okay so then what 10 years from now so like maybe maybe i should start from the beginning there so what do i think is really happening right that underlies all my investing i basically believe that starting around 1850 we had centralized means of production mass distribution mass production and what that allowed us to do is to create the modern corporation but in 1870 there was no accounting there were no org charts none of this stuff that we take for granted as a company really existed but mass production and mass distribution had a tendency to to centralize things because you got supply-side economies of scale and mass distribution allows you to get things out to people i think what started to happen uh probably in the late 70s early 80s with the microprocessor is now the economy is animated by mass computation and mass connectivity and those two uh those two attributes tend to decentralize the means of production and so you know i think we've moved from river rouge plant for ford model ts to personal 3d printers in the future and i think we've moved from peak centralization of three tv networks in the late 50s early 60s to now anybody can be their own publisher or media company that goes direct and so there's a a lot of very basic assumptions we have about companies that are just 150-year artifacts of time like somebody in 1820 wouldn't recognize a normal company of today there weren't there weren't any companies more than 20 people in the u.s you know in in 1820 hardly maybe a few spinning looms with 100 people but so what i believe is now the idea is the the social contract between a person and a big company people assume that it's not gonna that it's gonna persist i think it's gonna be radically different so in in the in the 1900s you know you had uh people wanting to be at a company for a very long time and you had large country companies because uh the coordination advantages of having a large organization at scale with supply-side economics was valid and created abundance then the same happened with the military then the same thing happened with the government media all of our major institutions but now i think the pendulum is uh swinging in the other direction towards um a worldwide network where everybody on the network every individual is a node on that network and every individual as a node on that network has a comparative advantage and they get they get paid by the network when they give the network what it wants uh and that's true for money it's true for jobs it's true for everything in my view are there examples of startups now that are that are executing this yeah so in the early days our investments were in these pure play networks twitter twitch uh companies like that what would it be what do you mean pure play a pureplay network would be you're not really reimagining a part of the economy so like twitch was a whole new thing and you could argue that twitter's had a big impact on the media but but that wasn't the thesis when we invested but then we started to get interested in this idea of well perhaps every sector of the economy is going to be reimagined around um sort of the the the micro means of production and so rather than economies of scale it's going to be local economies of algorithmic computation and networks that span the globe and so why did we invest in lyft lyft was a more modern way to think about getting a ride than taxes taxis are a command and control tops-down dispatch-driven technology lyft says hey riders and drivers can advertise their presence in real time on a network and algorithms will form an ad-hoc connection so it's kind of like this return of the invisible hand and uh now all of a sudden the invisible hand is done by algorithms rather than uh you know kind of in the good old days of people trading fur for musket or something like that but like it's it you know that's what we see happening time and again uh you know ohm connect is another uh board i'm on they're trying to uh create um incentives for people to use less electricity but but they're basically applying the ideas of software-defined networks to uh subtracting energy that homes use uh during certain times of the day and so i believe that every you know what is tesla really tesla is a car company that's animated by networked capitalism not industrial capitalism right they it's a software-defined car that's updated over the air it leverages machine learning it leverages network effects with all the sensors in the network to help it self-drive better apple was a network capitalist-centric phone compared to like nokia which thought we need to sell the best widget and so in sector after sector of our economy the companies that are software defined at their core i believe software-defined network-centric companies at their core are going to keep winning and they're going to keep displacing the companies that think of computers as the thing that you did to make your industrial thing go faster so you know burger king isn't a software-defined network even though it has computers it uses computers to say how many hamburgers did i sell today but it doesn't use computers to reinvent food in any fundamental way and the companies that we're investing in are companies that leverage network capitalism to reimagine reinvent markets from the beginning damn big idea i hope that wasn't that may be a little bit out there but uh that's kind of it it's such a big idea that it's hard to how can i make this more practical for myself and the listeners of someone interested in this field yeah and so the way i would say to make it more practical if you're a listener is the tendency is to say uh what's my career path going to be but through the lens of the 20th century you know i'm gonna i'm gonna make a progressive set of steps and i'm gonna uh you know i'm gonna get rewarded as i do the things that i seem to need to do in society but i would argue that it's more important in today's world to figure out a what am i awesome at or or maybe not even one of my the best in the world at but what is my what am i best at among all other things i'm good at what am i best at and then what does the world value and then what am i passionate about and it's like the intersection of that set of things is where you want to develop your talents because over time that's where your comparative advantage will be the highest and that is where the network will pay you the most for contributing to the network but i think sometimes it's useful to not think of not just what company do i want to join or what set of companies should i join my career instead you should say the entire world is a network everybody is a node in that network how can i be the best version of myself as a node on that network how can i create the most possible value for that network so that i'll get recognized by it and pay paid for the value that i deliver so how do you do that so let's say let's take you for example so let's say you look at the world this way as it's a giant network and um and you're trying to have your comparative competitive comparative advantage so what's your comparative advantage yeah i would say that my job is to be the very best partner for a super ambitious founder in the zero to one phase so right like if you look at my podcast people say hey why don't you have this guest why don't you have that guest but starting greatness is all about zero to one awesome startup super ambitious what was it like before they succeeded and there's power there's addition and subtraction you know like sometimes uh by saying what you're not for but like niching down you're very powerful to the people who care about your niche because people say where have you been all my life and so what you're trying to do is find that set of like-minded co-conspirators for the niche that you've really chosen to be great at and and not get preoccupied with the fact that you can't do it all right you're you're way better off understanding what you can just stick the landing at and and and and develop your talent so you can do it even better and better through time and today floodgate is more like a traditional firm right it's like a company kind of like let's say current world slash old world right you have a you have a brand you have multiple employees uh you have a central fund you have your lp base it's sort of static and then you're investing in a specific let's say set a criteria of of companies um whereas the way you're describing things it sort of feels like if correct me if i'm wrong it sort of sounded like in the future what my you 20 years from now what you might have done instead of set up floodgate is you would have set up i don't know um you know a one-person investing fund uh yourself or like a dow or something like that basically a trust that's going to invest in a whole bunch of things on the network and um and you wouldn't need the structure of of a fund with employees with all these different things so would you if you didn't have this already set up and you were setting it up for the next 20 years would you have set up your investing differently than you did with a kind of traditional vc fund well i i like the way we're set up because i think that when you're when you're investing in these crazy risky startups too early way too early or legally ambiguously too early uh it's good to have friends and it's good to have people to run ideas by but we have a very i i'm not saying i'm not sure our point of view works for everybody so i don't even think a startup is a company right so i think a startup is the the capabilities and talents of the founders and their insight about the future and what you're what you're betting is on two things one is that their insights right and two is they're good enough to navigate the idea to a great product someday but like lyft started a zim ride and twitter they couldn't decide whether to call it voicemail 2.0 or twtr twitch started as justin.tv octa started as sasher and so like what do you do with the fact that 90 of your profits come from things that started out different and so my my theory on that is the way to succeed is to realize that a startup isn't a company at all and that it's it's the insights and the founders and you're you you make fun of your ability to predict what they're going to come up with that is false precision to even try but instead where you should be precise is can these people do the job and uh is this is this a powerful enough breakthrough insight you um you i believe it's your partner i looked up who the top venture capitalists were i think it was your partner what's your what's her name uh ann miraco yeah yes and is uh i looked at like cb insights 2020 2019 2018 2017. i think she was in the top 10 sometimes number two or three in many many many of the years um consistently you just showed me a sign or a a thing of dollar bills with steve blank you know who's like godfather of silicon valley saying everything mike does turns into money you uh i wish what what makes you guys great what makes you able to spot these interesting opportunities i think that uh you know it's funny if you if you had say um warren buffett uh on your show or you know you've had stan drunken miller before on your show right and um when they talk about investments you'll probably notice they talk about a few things what's the operating history of the organization what is their competitive moat uh you know they have a set of factors you know um that cause them to think that a company is a good investment or not um what's interesting is in our world none of those mental models apply and so because a startup's not a company there is no operating history there there's no moat they don't even have a product yet they got no customers and so what i think we're better at than most is a understanding that's true and b then asking okay so what should the mental models be right if if charlie munger and warren buffett have 90 mental models and they don't apply to startup investing well what are the mental models for startup investing then and so we've spent years right just being students of that question and you know we probably got about 30 or so that we've developed but we try to we try to evaluate the startup through the lens of those mental models rather than make the mistake of thinking that a startup is a re-hosted company it's not one or two of those mental models that we wouldn't expect right like uh you know i might expect somebody to say you know we want to be in a uh a big market with customers who really love your products like okay yeah great you know um we want to be growing you know extremely fast exponential growth well yeah it's obvious at that point i also enjoy checkmate uh so so what's a what's a mental model that's not so obvious where 100 people in a room would nod their heads and immediately say i already do that i already think that way when i when it comes to investing for me yeah so i'll just give a few examples you know so i'd say at a meta level we have a set of mental models about founding teams and then we have a set of mental models about insights and um founding team a good example would be um jazz band and not a marching band so in companies you have org charts you have people who want cheap music and dance steps and if you don't give that to them the organization is going to be a chaotic mess and all screwed up and discombobulated in a startup it's more like when you go to the french quarter and you watch a jazz band there the guy the lead goes on riff and everybody else just goes with it and you'll never hear that tune the same way ever again but everybody knows that that's what they're in it for and nobody's saying hey that's not on my sheet music you didn't say that was going to happen right that's that's the way they like to um offer their art to the world and so i like to say when a when a startup starts it goes through this breakthrough sequence it has to have a great insight which is something about the future that's not obvious that most people don't know and then after that they have to create a product breakthrough where they get product market fit and zero to one and then they have to have a growth breakthrough where they get escape velocity and then and only then do they earn the right to someday be in the pantheon of companies but it's but it's wrongheaded to give startup founders big company advice at any of those stages in fact all of those stages are different it would be bad to give growth advice to an insight developer for example because it would be precisely wrong uh so that would be an example on the team side uh to me the um on the inside perspective it would be don't be market first because there is no market yet and so rather than trying to think of a startup market we want to arrive at startup markets by following inflections we want to we want to say okay the cost of an ai prediction is going down exponentially how is power going to shift in the industry because of that and like what what new markets might arise that had never existed before these inflections they they power your why now so like um with lyft um gps has got included for free in smartphones and we believe that everybody's gonna have smartphones someday even though in 2010 only 10 did so you could say wow now i can see a world in the future where drivers and riders will be able to locate each other on a network and ever and there will be a network effect because there'll be all these people have these phones you could have been right about that before then but you would have still failed because you wouldn't have enough people with the phones and they wouldn't have been able to find each other and so i'd say that's the other counter-intuitive thing is that you can't you can't look at the company's tangible operating history because there is none what you have to do instead is imagine a world where their inflections change the future in a dramatic way and that that you know change the rules and like all the stuff that people think is going to happen something very radically different is going to happen and why do i believe this entrepreneur what what is it that they've discovered about the world that could cause me to take that bet what you're describing is is awesome and it's like but but it's it's a it's a narrow it's a narrow but wonderful outlook so what you're describing about inflections and looking at the world in 20 years is definitely about disruption and these are things that are this is what allows an uber or an airbnb to go from not even an idea to a small idea to a 50 to 100 billion dollar company these are like truly disruptive and transformative things but then on the other side there's like on the podcast actually aired today sean interviewed this guy named brian who owns 100 of 1-800 got junk their revenue might be four or 500 million dollars and he owns all of it so he who knows he's probably worth two or three billion dollars and has probably a pretty calm life and he's not doing anything probably probably innovative at all i mean maybe there's like micro innovations like you know our supply chain is a little bit interesting or the way that we dispatch people is a little bit interesting or or it could just be operational excellence meaning our website ranks number one or uh we know how to get email right yeah speller name cute brand how do you um so like your your what we just discussed was far on one end do you ever look at the other side or or for your job do you only care about one side and maybe you just like to for shoot the [ __ ] or talk to your friends who want to get wealthy do you say like yeah but this side's actually kind of interesting too yeah and it's funny because we alluded to this earlier um i don't try to be for everybody uh i try to be the the very best at the thing i try to be good at and so my view is that i want to go very focused on breakthrough startups and in that zero to one phase and how they so i like to say i'm a rocket fuel salesman and i go i go to founders and i say don't take my fuel if you don't want to achieve escape velocity with that rocket that's on the launch pad because if you're not sure it's a rocket this fuel isn't going to be good for your vehicle right on your scooter right and so like i probably don't deserve too much credit when it does escape but i probably don't deserve too much of the blame when it doesn't right i'm just like just be clear about what i'm selling here and and people say well you know it's not realistic that um that everybody should build uh one of the 20 billion dollar plus exit startups of the year and i'm like and you're you're correct about that like i'm not saying that my advice or my approach is mainstream or even normal in fact i would say it's hyper not normal but like but in that area in that area of i sell rocket fuel to people who want to blast their rockets into outer space and get escape velocity i try to be the very best period and so like that's that's what i'm in it for so a lot of your listeners might be like oh that's interesting and kind of intellectually interesting but i'm not i'm not one of those but that's okay there's lots of ways to get rich in this world and there's lots of lots of ways to succeed in business every it comes back to everybody should know what's my comparative advantage and not be preoccupied by all the things you can't be the best at so you're not even close to the guy who sees like oh wow there's um a ton of really poorly run laundry stores or laundry mats we should buy all of them and put a back-end software i mean that doesn't even kind of closely uh or that doesn't even even get you excited well not only that like if somebody said hey can you give me some advice on how to grow this i would say you should not listen to me i don't know what i'm talking about i don't know how to do laundromats at scale like it's it's not even a question whether i'm interested it's a question whether i'm competent uh and i'm not i'm like i'm not and i don't try to be and i i let go of the idea that i need to be you that i love i love your answer by the way uh i have something to say about that too but i would say like you know you've made me realize that i think one of the things that we're we're trying to build our comparative advantages is like um we could have this we get on this podcast twice a week and we shoot the [ __ ] either just me and sam or bring a great guest like you on and we talk about everything from i think one of the most popular episodes was um you know biology talking about like the future of startups our cities and it's like wait what and you know biology will will bend your brain with the blockchain and then uh the next episode so he's probably the most listened to and the second most listed too is this side hustle this entrepreneur has where he's we break down his business of vending machines he's got 27 vending machines he's making six figures of profit and you know he got started with very little capital and it doesn't take rocket science or rocket fuel to do it and our listeners like the um the breadth of that uh how we can hop from blue collar we have a segment called the hillbilly side hustle which is like you know just a blue collar kind of like simple thing you can do all the way to okay what is you know some disruptive idea how does ai impact the space and is it okay if we talk about biology for a minute because i think he's like amazing and he's crazy yeah so so like um you know earlier i mentioned this idea of cloud culture i think biology probably has the best handle on this of anybody i talk to so like and and you know i've listened to much of what he said but like what i think happens at the limit is that all of these different cloud cultures are like their own societies yep and so right now the main main organizing principle of society is the nation state which is also an economies of scale centric model right but if you think about it what is bitcoin really bitcoin is a society of people who care about sound money and the protocol is what enables governance and so these societies at the limit i think look more and more like the future version of countries right you know what is a country really it's a bunch of people who decide what their boundaries are who decide who gets in the club and they have a constitution where they decide how to separate powers and how to protect the rights of individuals against the mob and the tyrant um that's exactly what bitcoin does with its protocol and just to use some other examples so bitcoin is the people who have this you know cult-like belief religious belief around sound money ethereum is people who believe in programmable money and then you have wall street bets which is like hey let's just middle finger to you know uh to the large you know to the incumbents so how does you know david beat goliath and we're gonna we're basically gonna screw around with them and make profits while we do it that's what we're here for uh and we will we will assign ourselves names you know they call themselves retards and things like that because in their culture that's okay right yeah burning man is a pop-up culture that happens for a week in the desert where all these people will go behave totally differently than they will the other 51 weeks out of the year and so there's a whole bunch of these either pop-up cultures cloud cultures that all have different different virtues different uh admissions criteria and and all the different pieces you just described yeah and it's so interesting because it there's historical parallels right like in the in the reformation uh the pope used to declare all the answers and then all of a sudden the printing press comes out in double entry accounting and now martin luther can distribute the bible to lots of people uh with in a permissionless way ironically and then not only that the merchants of venice can trade with each other without a central authority because they can have double entry records and keep track of ious and so to me like the internet and blockchain are just so amazingly parallel to that and i think society ebbs and flows it's like when you're too decentralized for too long it's chaotic and so then then you have innovations that centralize the means of production but then it gets too centralized and so what we're seeing now i believe is wall street bets perfect example the people at the edge are saying the network should decide not the center and if you read books like revolt to the republic and things like that you see a world where the people at the edge are starting to say about the people at the center you're illegitimate just like people at the edge back in the reformation started to say that about the the pope and some of the things that were happening with um exclusionary you know sort of insider only activities and so in the last two years you know social media went from you know the edge to call it pointing at mainstream media mainstream media now is like synonymous with the with fake news right that wasn't even a thing five years ago right um mainstream media is now used as a derogatory description of something which is kind of crazy right that's a big change and the important thing is like i try not to be too judgmental about it so i don't sit there and say oh those mainstream media people are no good i'm just like it's inevitable that media is going to decentralize it's inevitable that money will it's inevitable that politics will it's inevitable that a lot of these things will and it's like arguing for it or against it's kind of like arguing against the direction of the wind it's it's just it's it's fruit but but then back to the your listeners to me what that means writ large is if the 20th century was about being the quote-unquote organization man and following the rules and progressing up the hierarchy it doesn't exist anymore now you have to be you have to take agency for your own life and own your comparative advantage and understand that that is your responsibility as a free person in this world and if you do that you're going to be incredibly rewarded in the 21st century but if you wish that it's like the 20th i got bad news for you it's not going to be floodgate invested into refinery29 right yeah um for those we have unfortunately or i mean it is what it is a lot of our listeners are men so they don't know refinery 29 is a huge media company geared for women refinance29.com they were pretty big right they uh were like maybe 200 million dollars or 150 million dollars in revenue and then they sold or merged or something like that with vice right yes um and vice is like a probably a billion dollar a year entity at this point with everything they have going on do you think that media companies like that given what you're saying about i mean because devices at this point even though they were new vice and refinery 29 are probably almost like old school at this point do you think that those style of media companies are still going to be great companies given what you've just said well i think that there's going to be a very rich ecosystem of all types of media companies but but to me the defining new characteristic will be that media is no longer a function of the credential elites telling you what to think and uh that that was the real problem that we started to get in the media in my opinion is that um you you had a set of credential elites running these media companies of which there weren't very many and um these institutions are all inherited now rather than founded and so the people running these institutions didn't really understand what made them great in the old days and so they they started to get worse over time in their effectiveness and legitimacy and so to me the real question about media is not so much is there one way it's going to happen versus not i think that the winners will be those that um niche down have a comparative advantage in the type of content that they cover and attract uh the attention of the people who care about that type of content and and the credentials won't define it because um the the old media companies had credentialed elites running them but they also had a monopoly on distribution with the newspaper and how they how they got print magazines out and things like that so i think that all of that's going to change is there any media companies or um opportunities that you're looking at and you're like oh that's kind of interesting for us i would i would say that my colleague ann miraco is probably smarter about that than i am you know i and it's funny even within floodgate i tend to stick to my areas that i'm excited about and i um so there's a lot of exciting things that i'll that i'll miss probably um but i'll ask you a question yeah i'm gonna ask you a question that might be hard to answer because it's one of those things like oh you know how how are you you but you um you've said a couple things that caught my attention you know you have these nice phrases so one is i didn't realize that i see this on your bio here i didn't realize you coined the term thunder lizards i've heard many investors talk about thunder lizards that's something they want to invest in which is like sort of like you know the godzilla type companies that emerge every decade or so and like that's what you really chase because those are where all the returns are and those are what change the world um but you also said the kind of the rock i'm a rocket fuel salesman you are catchier than your average vc you are uh more i don't know you have you have a little sort of gift there of coining these little mind viruses these little little phrases that stick with people rather than just saying a bunch of jargon um is that a skill you learned consciously or is that just you know growing up your parents talk like that where'd that come from uh i don't know but i guess the the way i look at things in this world is you want to force a choice and not a comparison and and so like what do i mean by that like like yeah you just did it again you did it again yeah exactly right so so like like if i say hey we're investing in particularly disruptive types of companies that's not the same as saying thunder lizards right and so why is it so important well if you're trying to create a breakthrough by definition it breaks free from the present so by definition it can't be compared to something in the present uh because if it's comparable to what's in the present it's too incremental it's too conventional and so like when i say force of choice and not comparison i said i say to founders if let's say everybody's selling banana you can't say i'm a 5x better banana you instead you should come out and say i'm an apple and not everybody's gonna want your apple but a hundred percent of the people who prefer apples are gonna want what you have and like forget the guy who wants the best banana there's a thousand of those people you need to waste not an erg of energy on them you need to spend your time on the people who potentially value your advantage and start a movement around that you know earlier we talked about markets companies have markets that could be segmented sub segmented and classified startups don't startups they create movements they create they have a secret about the future they get early believers who co-conspire with them to create a co-create a different future and the market emerges as a consequence of the movement succeeding but in the early days we just have to get people moving we have to get people moving to somewhere different not better and so as a result we must force a choice and not a comparison and as a seed investor i have to do the same thing because there's 2 000 seed funds now and so it was innovative when and i helped invent seed investing in 2006 but like now there's 2 000 firms and so we have to come up with some way for people to say okay i can't reconcile the choice of working with floodgate versus brand x um right writing checks with writing checks on the spot that's how we differentiate well i don't know but i think there's a lot to be it's it relates to niching down i think a lot of people would benefit from the idea of how can i force a choice and not a comparison it takes more courage and it forces you to say no to more than you say yes to but if you if you do it the right way the stuff you say yes to i like to say it's less but better is the way to think about it you've uh you've had some amazing people in your podcast you've invested in a ton of amazing companies and i bet you know just about everyone in this world of all these people that you've invested in or or did business with if you guys were put on a on a stranded island who do you think would come out on top who's the most formidable person that you've uh you've worked with oh there have been so many great people um i think a lot of it would be a function of just uh who had the right idea at the right time you know so much of this is just i call it a founder future fit it's just like you know like when it when andreessen did mozilla it was just he was the perfect person in the world at the perfect time to do that idea and so you know it's not just how formidable is the person but it's also just was it was the timing right and were they just the right person the right time but i'm i'm um i'm obsessed with stories and i love interesting personality types is there anyone that fits that bill of of being incredibly formidable like to the point of like you you think how can you be more like that person or or i wish everyone thought a little bit more like this person yeah yeah so i i try to learn from everybody but i not never try to imitate or be like somebody else because then that that that defeats the purpose i'm that now i'm comparing myself to somebody else and so i never do that uh i don't believe that people should compare themselves with anybody i think they should learn from people but i don't think they should compare themselves to others and i don't think they should have heroes and i think that yeah you mentioned a couple people that you've learned from uh you know biology being one um you know tim ferriss that he learned from you who are some other names you know if if people listen to this and they're like you know or me right i really enjoyed hearing you talk during this hour uh i think you got a bunch of smart ideas i want to know you know what's he eating basically what's your information diet what are what are your sort of some of your favorite people to follow and learn from that you're getting a bunch of interesting information that's not just like the rest yeah so um well i like that the farm street blog a lot uh with shane parish and and uh and by the way just because i don't invest like buffett and monger doesn't mean i don't study them like crazy right because i think that when i when i read how they look at the world i'll understand what's different about how they look at the world but i'll also connect dots that will make the difference of my world more clear i read a ton i probably read about one or two books a week just in general um what are some of the ones i've read recently that i liked one i like a lot it's called the courage to be disliked uh by a couple of japanese authors i think it's it's amazing and so then i went down this rabbit hole of the the psychiatrist uh alfred adler who who kind of came of age at the same time as freud and young but uh wasn't as famous but i think he's i think that alfred adler's ideas about individual agency are perfectly timed for the 21st century uh so i've been liking uh everything that i can get my hands on about him um and it's and it's weird because although i read a lot of books there's there's always a subset that i come back to over and over again where i try to take notes and because i try to i try to make sure i really understand it so that i could explain it to somebody else in a really clear way uh so i so i liked the courage to be disliked quite a bit uh i've been reading a lot of stuff on stoicism lately uh which i find to be very misunderstood um but you know what's the misunderstanding i think that most people think of stoics as uh you know uh emotionless uh turn the other cheek when things go bad and i actually find that when you read about the stoics and that there are actual philosophies in this world they're actually quite optimistic and quite inspiring and i find that uh it's helpful for me to um internalize so like things like some of the lessons of stoicism and some of the lessons of alfred adler all find myself reading those books over and over again and and trying to make the list of things to learn and ask myself every day am i am i exercising those muscles and then there will be other things where i'm like a friend of mine i'll say this is a really good book i'm like i should just read that so right you know that's just fun it's great all right we're coming up on the hour so we can we can wrap it um mike thanks for joining this is great where do people find you if they want to get more so obviously the podcast uh so starting greatness where else should they follow to get more yeah i'm on twitter or at m2jr uh let's see where that's probably the best place yeah or floodgate.com you're you're a tweeting machine i've been following you since uh i talked to him years ago about you okay yeah and and if you guys want to cover any other topics happy to i know that we kind of bounced around so uh i want the american next i feel like that would have been an interesting one that i think we should we if you're up for we could do a round two around american nationalities i think there's a bunch that's there that that people are talking a ton about yeah in all these themes right like i think that the idea also of uh you know blockchains and sort of thinking about um the the future of money and how we're going to a currency governed by commons rather than fiat government is interesting i think that you know the evolution of you know i like to say that computing uh phases you had mainframes and you had pcs and you had internet and they always start with an enabling technology and they commoditize the prior so mainframes computers were expensive and then pcs computers were basically free proprietary software becomes valuable okay next thing the internet software becomes open source amassing lots of proprietary data becomes valuable and so one way i look at blockchains are they're the next wave of computing and that they're going to probably democratize data and control uh of things back to networks and then what becomes a valuable thing my instinct is it's about governance and so there's there's like a lot of conversation we could have about that that might be interesting and then i totally agree uh america next all the stuff that i think is gonna have to happen and for the military to be more agile and uh for us to kind of upgrade our thinking about stuff you know when you're talking i'm like this is what i could be like if i could just focus on three things that i really believed in and i just stopped thinking about other [ __ ] for like two years i could have this level of clarity and uh and insight and you're making me want to focus which sam and many others in my life have ever have tried to get me to focus before and uh this may be the the most effective way well there's no one way right like i like to be people are like a t right it's like uh you want to be a mile wide an inch deep so that you just can appropriate creative ideas from the world but then i think you want to be a mile deep somewhere right so it's like a t right and it's like that's why you read several books at a time but then you also go deep on a small number they're truly great do you um who who should we invite next on this podcast who do you think is some of the some some of the are some of the best storytellers and prolific idea folks you had reid hoffman we're trying to get in touch with him is there anyone else that you think is is we should invite you reed hoffman naval ravikant um you know chris sacca is always a good storyteller um i can think about that you know the instagramers are fun uh andy radcliffe probably not as famous as some some of your guests and stuff but boy is he a clear thinker uh a great communicator what's the best way to get in touch with reid just to call emily you think probably uh let's see um um or you just say that i've mentioned you guys and that it was a good show and then i enjoyed it the people that you just mentioned i'll email the people you just mentioned and i'll say mike said you're the mike said you're the guy yeah i'll just still you know i haven't seen as much of chris sacca lately so i don't know if that would be as effective with him but uh but i think that uh some of the other guys would would uh would recognize me pretty well i showed up for chris one morning he texted me said hey i gotta film a shark tank intro we need some bodies in the background uh to for my my intro and i i left my job i went to where he was at nine in the morning and i filmed a uh i was a body double i was i was an extra in the background for his shark tank intro so i'll pull that favorite card and be like hey chris now's the time to pay it back yeah if you haven't had mark cuban i think he's really good uh um and and by the way on this so it's funny because you guys are using zencaster um so does shane harris so i was on his uh sorry shane parish and on his um after he listened to the to the talk he's like there's so many up front questions i wish i'd asked you uh can we do this again and so i was like sure so we ended up having a lot of content that he kind of cut down but like if if you find yourself in that position here let me know i'm happy to uh help you make it is bet you know less but better right so if we can right you know if we're we're gonna ship a product it might as well be [ __ ] awesome right so i love you where are you from i was born in oklahoma but moved all around because my dad was an ibm yeah and then worked at microsoft yeah i feel like um how old how old are you uh early 53. yeah so you're i'm i'm 31 so you would have had to have me when you were quite young but uh i feel like you could you could you i could you could be my uncle i think that's what the founders call me their nickname for me is the crazy uncle so yeah yeah i think we kind of look the same i can tell you i thought you would have been from the midwest or maybe the south i'm from missouri oh nice yep show me state yeah and uh my cousins uh live in oklahoma and uh in owens oklahoma where they buck bulls um i i had a i have a feeling you and i we could be distance distant cousins so we don't even know it yep yeah you never know coming from missouri and oklahoma you never know yeah well i appreciate this man this is awesome shawn you got anything to say no my camera died i'm at the overheating mark but uh mike this is great thank you for coming on i i enjoyed that that was good and you're in austin uh now i live in marin county so i'm in northern california oh i thought you lived in austin for some reason no i i helped tim though find his place so when he decided to move i you know i used to live in austin about up until about 15 years ago and my family's from there all my relatives and stuff and so you know you did the opposite of what everyone else did it it seems so and everybody keeps asking me when are we going to move back to austin i you know i don't know i'm pretty happy with where we live but you know it's pretty crazy time so you never know we'll see well thanks for being here we'll talk

i get to see how they're wired i get to see what makes them tick i get to see what they're motivated by so now when it comes time to get great you know great effort out of them i know what moves the needle for them personally i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be so on this episode uh we're talking to dan we're asking about them asking about the episode we talked about we broke down the co-working space and we and we found like an interesting opportunity uh a founder started and sold the company in that space and he still said he would start another company in that space and thinks it could be huge which is a good sign we talked about this weird business called ice barrels and then we talked about the nike for recovery the nike of recovery uh which is a really interesting company great story and we talked about adam newman the founder of wework and how he's got this like crazy hypnotic personality and i love learning about that i actually think it's like something that you need if you're gonna ever lead anyone and then i shared a steve jobs story i heard that may or may not be true i have no idea but it could be true it could be true that's all i will guarantee all right that's the episode um by the way if there's like a follow button on your spotify do me a favor click that because we're trying to grow the podcast and then click the subscribe button on itunes thank you it literally makes us like you only need like a handful of people in order to like go up in the ratings and it's because of that i think so click it what's up what's going on cool shirt thank you me or dan dan got uh dan got a harvard shirt also so he's part of the crew now oh there you go dan you look nice but i actually dan did you go to harvard i could see that yeah he looks like a harvard man i didn't go to harvard but i have been to the bookstore oh all right same same same um what's going on anything new uh yeah lots of new stuff but let's jump in we have a bunch of topics today so we'll uh we'll spare people to small talk um all right i think they'd like that but that's fine i'm down let's get down to business uh where do you want to go first um you have something that you did a bunch of research on i want to go go to that first was it the co-working spaces you were going into what are you looking at yeah so oh by the way i see of ice barrel here interesting yes um i'm happy to discuss that um ice um co-working so on our trip ben made a suggestion he i i was one of us was teasing like we should do this we should do this we should do this him or you or me one of us but he he was kind of nailing down the point mentioned co-working yeah and i was like that's kind of cool i think his quote was he's like but here's my big idea for the podcast uh take the mfm take my first million and uh and create like a network of co-working spaces that already exist just license the name out and offer the promotion to your members to be to be able to access them that was his idea yeah yes and i started thinking about that and i've always i wanted to get a little bit more into real estate and i thought it was cool and i just basically put the bat signal out there and i tweeted out who is an expert in co-working i want to learn and what i love to do for this pod i did this with this vending machine all i do is i get someone on the phone and i don't want to bring them on the podcast because they mean they're boring or they're not good at this type of thing right but i basically just want to ask them tons of questions and that's what i did and i took notes and so i found a guy named preston uh i actually don't know how to pronounce his last name i know i never know how to pezic p-e-s-e-k so his twitter handle is preston pezik p-e-s-e-k and he had this company called spacious which he sold for um he sold the wework and i imagine he sold it for a lot of money because when i called him it was like noon east coast time and he was just going for a bike ride his butt so it doesn't work anymore yes well it looked like he was in like a nice area of town in new york and he wasn't working so i imagine it was a good deal but have you heard of uh spacious by any chance what was it okay does it still exist or they shut it down they shut it down but it was crazy interesting so the way so so we're going to talk about co-working right now and we're going to talk about where the opportunities are and where this guy where this guy thinks there's opportunities and he has an interesting perspective he wouldn't tell me the revenue but i bet i would imagine it was north of eight figures a year in revenue but spacious what it did originally was they would find restaurants that were only open at night or had most of their business from six to you know dinner time and they would do a co-working thing where they you would pay a little bit of money 29 i believe and you would get access to to use this restaurant as a co-working uh place so i'd heard of this before that there are restaurants that basically have prime locations nice interiors and they're only going to be used during meal times and so the kind of pre-dinner service which is like your work day they were turning into this i i remember thinking oh that's cool and i never heard about it again so i sort of assumed it didn't work but what you're saying is it started to kind of work and they got acquired no so what he was saying that it worked wonderfully but wework made him an offer so good he's like i can't refuse this um i don't know if this guy i met he worked at a hedge fund before but maybe like you know he he didn't come from a rich background and it was a big deal so i don't blame them but basically it started by doing restaurants eventually it did retail so what that means is um you have uh uh some type of like ground level real estate and they would make a deal with the retail uh so retail uh real estate so not necessarily like it's not like a lululemon store it's like a store that's typically used for lululemon they would make deals with them for as short as 30 days but it could be as long as six to 12 months where they would lease the place and then they would charge people 29 and you would try to get people to come in it's called a a hot seat basically so like a pop-up yeah well you know what that is hot desking yeah so basically you don't have you don't have an assigned seat you come in and it's sort of like first come first serve type of thing for the day so if i told you about this and you didn't know anything about the business i imagine you'd be skeptical and think like this doesn't this probably can't work that well right i'd be like yeah it's hard right uh you know it's cool to have the airbnb for for for for co-working or for your for work and uh i've heard of a lot of people try this people are trying this with your home you could take part of your home and turn it into a like a cafe for people uh to come and sit and have wi-fi and um i just felt like i never heard from any of these companies ever again i heard the idea and then likes crickets for the next two years so according to preston who started and exited the company he uh he may not start this because like i don't know if i want to start another company but he goes i would love to invest in this space which is always a great sign if someone has started and sold something and still wants to go back and do it he goes it crushed it and i think that someone could still crush it he goes it's just like a hotel uh four seasons can exist and also like um motel 6. a motel 6 like a lot of different brands can exist in this space but it's incredibly lucrative and it can work wonderfully so for his spaces the way it would work is they would have at least 100 seats which means 100 place 100 areas that someone could sit so 100 seats and then they would have check-ins but they would aim to have 200 to 300 seats in a good location the target was 15 check-ins per month and if a location had that 29 that comes out to be around 90 000 a month and uh the profit margin on that could be about 40 percent right so one low and that and that profit margin includes the the person manning the location and then rent so quite lucrative and he was like yeah we we could crush it and he was like you could definitely bootstrap this into a smaller location but he goes i think that there's a lot of space for this and if you're gonna do it raise as much money as you possibly can and i think a person could build a business that makes a hunt or makes a billion dollars a year in revenue so how is this different than just we work right like isn't this just i'll explain so the problem with wework basically it's long so so here i've tried to break this down into a framework and so the reason why a lot of co-working doesn't work now we're talking about uh what's it called hot desk hot desk is different than quote the traditional when you think of traditional co-working you probably think of like a freelancer or a small business owner who wants to spend 300 a month to have a desk all the time at a at a wework so let's just call that the traditional we uh co-working and the way that that worked is basically you sign an agreement for 10 years for a lease and then you go and do arbitrage where you find all right if i'm spending this much in my lease per square foot i'm going to subdivide it and i'm going to rent it uh for a short term but there's here's the issue long-term liability meaning your 10-year lease with a short-term uh income stream a short-term rental agreement and so the people may only stay for two three four months because it's a month-to-month lease that you're renting to your and he goes he goes basically you just get churn and it's just hard to keep up with that and because things can change like a pandemic where everyone works from home yeah and he's like that it just doesn't work and so what we did was we took short-term liability meaning a lot of their places can um kick them out at any time but they had so many of them and it was considered like a pop-up that it was okay and so it didn't matter if a place closed for a little while because they can just go somewhere nearby in that building um or in that area and so it worked out really really well okay i um i don't know if it's because i didn't talk to this guy or what but i still feel a little bit like yeah you know same [ __ ] different toilet um as far as like i'm not sure i'm not sure i don't i don't fully understand why this is that much better than traditional co-working and i think traditional co-working is you know kind of marginal marginally good or maybe i've just seen some disasters right breather uh breather raised a ton of money and looked like they were the next unicorn and i think so ended up selling for three million dollars so they sell to three million dollars for i don't know like you know i i have like an uncle who could have bought breather right so so it didn't have like a fantastic exit what wework is also run into problems that i think were not just the pandemic but um this arbitrage model was sort of thin so i don't know i'm a little bit skeptical but okay where do you see the opportunities beyond that's okay if you're skeptical to be honest i'm skeptical too but i still think it's cool but i've got another angle here yeah so co-working i asked him but co-working sounds more interesting because i want that lo i want that like more uh i want that recurring revenue and i don't want to open up like loads of locations how do i make that work he goes well the best way that you can make that work is you've got supply and you've got demand and the the supply being um i'm probably gonna screw up my supply and demand so actually let's just skip that part uh but basically you have your consumers so your people who want to come and rent that place he was like that's actually not that important what's important is that you pick good locations and you do the real estate part well but um what if you could figure that out which is like kind of straightforward but still a lot of work you have to figure out how to make your consumers incredibly sticky and the only way that he could find that can make it sticky is you have to have shared interests so for example do you know the wing yeah yeah the female co-working space he says that that's a great business and the reason is is that there's likely not gonna be the reason why you need to be sticky is you need someone to be willing to stay there for over a year right and so he goes shared interest is the best way and he goes how do you come up with shared interest you go to facebook groups you go to meetup.com and you just find like whatever is like people have like a fan base so it could be like uh women it could be different minority groups it could be fitness enthusiasts he's like i think that there's a huge opportunity for people in co-working as long if you can make it sticky so people working on similar types of things they don't want to leave their their office that's where you have a a really good business whereas we work it didn't really have that as much right so maybe an mfn co-working business could actually work but maybe not yeah maybe maybe you know one interesting thing i don't know if you saw there's a bank that did uh co-working inside of it i think chase bank or well it was awesome i used to go there all the time well which one was it uh capital capital capital one or whatever the capital one is it the capital one chase i think is is is the parent there so you used to go there so why were they doing that they just wanted foot traffic in the branch or what so here's the other thing is that co-working actually can actually be a great customer customer legion so another way is if you want to go in the co-working business it could actually be far more interesting if you're a software i i joked with my guys at hubspot i was like guys we should do this so if you're a software company i actually think there's an interesting play here to have a co-working or if you're a bank something that you are trying to get freelancers or business owners and you have a super high ltv of tens of thousands of dollars it actually i think could be interesting to do this yeah like i wonder why doesn't uh you know every every tech company spending so much money recruiting engineers um and like just recruiting in general why not just have space as a recruiting tool so so you basically rent out space even if you break even or are slightly unprofitable you would make up for it in the actual recruiting of people who are there because they're in your orbit they you know they're in the uber office in the uber co-working ring uh you know area and they get to eat the food and whatever else and sure enough you're just absorbing talent uh you know as you go as part of that i don't know if it'd be worth it but it is uh that's i don't know those are my thoughts on co-working i don't have a ton of thoughts i think that wework is great as a real estate company um and by great i don't mean like it's bulletproof obviously the pandemic was sort of the worst possible thing that could happen to any co-working um you know co-working company but i i mean i do believe most most value in real estate is by uh change of use so you um you buy a thing that's valued at uh warehouse you know uh square footage and you convert it into self storage and you make more per square foot um that's what we work with doing it's the same fundamental model as uh self storage but they were doing it with people and uh and i think that that business if not sort of managed by a lunatic probably wouldn't have got as big as fast but also would not have had the fall it did and um and i'm curious to see how this shakes out i would be shocked like a lot of people love to [ __ ] on wework they think it's a terrible business well i would be shocked if 10 years from now there wasn't at least two or three multi-billion dollar co-working uh companies out there so like you can [ __ ] on the space you can share it on wework but in reality i think that there are gonna be winners in that space let's talk about the the lunatic real quick so you just said it was worn by a lunatic if you're one of this is probably even more fascinating so i went and did a lot of research on this and i talked to people not this guy but other people who knew adam or worked with adam yeah so wework was run by this guy named madame newman he was like crazy maybe not always in a bad way probably mostly in a good way and i talked to a bunch of people and i narrowed it down and i basically said what makes this guy so great so basically they are explaining to me they're they go adam was here's like a quote from this woman i talked to adam adam was unique on a one-to-one convo it was like looking into it when i talked to him it was like looking into a mirror and seeing myself but that mirror was a megaphone of my best self he made me believe that i was the best and i could do anything and i asked him i was like was he's dyslexic isn't he and they go yeah i think he is just i've noticed that dyslexic people rank so high on having this ability to and this sounds negative and i don't mean this negative to manipulate people and to manipulate them into believing that like like to con to persuading and leading people and they and they just said he would i would tell himself and he would echo it back to me but for some reason i would believe it and i believe that i was the best that i possibly could be and he made me feel that anything was possible and i think that that is so fascinating and even more interesting than we work did you watch the wework documentary on hulu did you no i i did uh because you know you get to sort of see firsthand what's the guy like cause he's on camera it's pretty raw it's from you know it's footage from when he when we work with sort of still on the rise and um and yeah it was sort of this cult of personality around him he didn't seem particularly charming or anything like that but i think the thing i've seen with this is some people are so irrational in their belief right like it takes some irrationality to do anything because if if you're just perfectly rational you look at your current situation and you'll say this is what it is and anytime something else you know what a goal or a vision or a dream it will look completely irrational and so we all have a little bit of irrationality in us otherwise we wouldn't have goals we wouldn't have dreams um he was like sort of 90 10 90 irrational maybe not even 10 rational maybe it was just 99 1 uh irrational to rational where from day one he was saying what this was going to be how amazing it was going to be how this investor was going to give us all every dollar that they had how this customer was going to have the greatest experience of their life and he believed it with every bone in his body and when you encounter somebody with that kind of certainty it is very like addictive and sort of like intoxicating um because if they believe in themselves that much there's really two ways to go some people become haters because they don't have that sort of self belief in themselves and then other people sort of become followers and they they join in because they're just like being around that level of certainty so that was pretty cool i love it by the way you know when i watched that fire festival documentary yeah i felt the same way i was like first of all badass vision fire special was a great idea with and it almost worked god-awful execution and it almost worked it was so irrational that it almost overcame rationality but it didn't it failed in the end but most people point and laugh and i think that that was you know like kind of an amazing swing that was more impressive than that failure was more impressive than most people's successes as far as i'm concerned i thought there was a big big audacious vision got a bunch of people on board almost pulled it off um almost might be a little generous but uh you know at least what i mean is like he rallied people around like almost in the sense of like it could have yeah sold all the tickets got all the big names on board right like right you know and and it wasn't fraud like it wasn't uh intentional fraud from what i remember like it wasn't like i think it was but that's okay that that that's like not entirely important i mean i do think that like there was fraud but like there was a true belief of i can i can pull it off right there's fake it till you make it and then there's fraud fake it till you make it is hey it's not there yet but i believe i can pull this off we're gonna do it we're gonna find a way if i just tell them this if i tell them it's already booked then we'll figure out a way to get it booked you know intention matters i actually when we hung out this weekend i felt not the same thing but a little bit of that with you where you like you didn't say these any audacious things but you have this sense of belief it's like well yeah why not like you went and met with people that i'm like really you're doing that yeah just talk to him i'm gonna do this like you do do you know that you have a little bit of that in you as well you you have a more of a i think you and this this is not insulting you are because you're like emotionally healthy you're not like adam to where you have to say i'm gonna take over the world in order to feel good do you know what i mean yeah so like you're very confident you're you do [ __ ] almost because you just like it's more fun than it is out of a of a personality deficit of like i have to be on top and so it's a little bit more healthy but you have that same magnetism do you realize that right i do realize it because i try to do that and you know once you try it something for like five years straight you stop having to try you know effort effort is what creates effortless so i put an effort into it and now i don't have to try that anymore it just happens and the reason why the reason i know i did it was because i was very conscious about it the reason we both love conor mcgregor and why i think really any fan loves conor mcgregor is not because of the way he throws his left hand when he punches it's because the guy had this ludicrous self-belief when he was literally on welfare you know as a as a failed plumber in ireland and he was talking about how he's going to become you know the largest you know i'm going to become a two-weight world champion the biggest sports star on earth number one on the forbes list and then guess what this year where he landed number one on the forbes list he's the number one star in combat sports you know two-weight world champion achieved and so those of us who got to see that rise it's yeah we're happy for connor but really we're happy for ourselves that holy [ __ ] this guy with just literally nothing but self-confidence self-confidence drove him to work because he believed that he could achieve it so he was motivated and then when he worked plus the self-confidence you know overcame all the odds and had it maybe i can have some of that too put a little bit of that in my drink that's how i felt about it and so you know i don't care about becoming a two-weight world champion but i have my own versions of those that i just sort of decided why would i why would i doubt myself right what's that see what's you can see what's written behind me this is my uh this will be one of my sunday stories so i don't want to i don't want to spoil it but the the teaser is the teaser for this sunday story time with sean is doubt doubt if you're gonna doubt anything doubt doubt um and so that's how i feel now so how do you feel confident uh well you start to doubt doubt you you start to lack lack you start to doubt having lack you start to lack having doubt that's that's where you want to get to in order to have that sort of unshakable self-confidence what's that conor mcgregor had that forbes saying yeah the two-weight champion uh what what what's yours uh i've always said this i want to have a one percent of the world's population uh consider me someone who is you know like they're one of their favorite teachers somebody who who who they've learned from so the version of that that i saw was that math teacher that guy beat you in india who sold out a stadium he had a stadium full of people come to watch him teach i thought that was incredible and you know you start to see it into reality right we just did a live show okay it wasn't it wasn't 70 million people it was 300 people it was 400 people showing up at our live show right but but you start to see that come to come to fruition of like okay a year ago that didn't exist that who's to say a year from now that's not 3 000 people who's to say you're from that it's not 30 000 people right like that seems entirely believable to me and i've sort of envisioned it and so when it happens i won't be surprised i'll be pleased but i won't be surprised and i've actually heard stories about a lot of these people so um i've talked to a lot of the early employees one of my good friends his name's will he was like number 40 or something at uber and he tells me stories where he was like uh he's like i just felt like anything was possible it was i felt like i was in in war and my co-workers were were my fellow troops and i loved it i felt like there was constant action and we were in this together that had this similar type of vibe i've heard who else have you heard that from um i mean hear from a lot of like fraudsters obviously but yeah who else it's the sword that cuts both ways right you know if you spot it you got it that's that's sort of the way that most of these things work all the extreme strengths come with a corresponding evil right just like facebook a technology that connected everybody in the world and then guess what you know like [ __ ] chaos also from connecting everybody in the world the spread of information has never been easier we can spread you know and a student in india can you know has more access to like knowledge than the emperor did you know 100 years ago well guess what they also have access to fake news and porn and all these other bad things right like that's why it's funny whenever somebody would criticize crypto and say oh it could be used for all these bad things all that tells me is that this can be used for extremely good things also because there's a duality with all of those and so that's how i think about you know this extreme confidence if i was gonna rank i would put at the top if you if you think about what's the most intoxicating desirable thing when you meet somebody the first number one i would say is a sense of peace when you meet somebody who's truly happy like they're not like bubbling over with with joy but they're just happy you know when they're at rest when nothing is going on or even when you know quote unquote bad things are going on i think that is when you see that it's really hard to like you just want to be around that person you want to be like that person and who have you met anyone like that my trainers like that like just the other day uh he came came to our house i think i won he trained me for 80-90 minutes then he trained the next person and trained next person so he was going from 1 p.m till 7 30 p.m which doesn't sound like a lot of hours but when you watch what he's doing like he's not just sitting there like on his phone while you're working out he's fully on motivating you changing the weights demonstrating the thing bringing that excitement talking to you whatever he's got to be like switched on performing and so it was like hour seven he hadn't eaten anything he hadn't had a sip of water uh you know he hadn't had a single break and it was just one person and it wasn't even expected by the way it was just somebody who was like at my house was like oh can i get a session in he's like come on in and so bye wait wait wait wait wait you just had people coming in to your house like my mom was over and she she wanted to work out normally she does it on a different day but she he was like all right yeah jump in i'm here and so what happened was by the end of it um he so so i walk into the garage where he where he was cleaning up the like kind of like the workout stuff and he's got this huge smile on his face me and my wife we walked out because we were gonna go for a walk and uh we see him he's smiling he's laughing i don't even know nobody was there i don't know what he's smiling about he was just smiling and then he was putting things away and he just looks at me he goes part of time and i don't even know what he was talking about i have no idea what he was thinking about but he just was like in that mood and he was this huge smile and i go man i told my wife i go man you know how i am at the end of a work day like when i work hard and i feel like i really exerted effort and i had to go above and beyond and do a little extra that day i become like such a whiny little brat like i'm like i'm so tired i need to eat i need like like i did so much now you know i know you need to do that work i'm i'm done you know um and i become the sort of like entitled little brat about myself and you know and i'm like crashing and i felt like this guy was just like i mean to come at me and be like party time like i don't know what he was even thinking about but that's not the way i end my work day when i feel like i worked overtime so what's number two then you said happiness the next one is the is the is the sort of self-delusion it is the like irrational confidence in self when you meet somebody like that that is intoxicating even if they are not successful so like i intentionally have not put rich and famous people on this list yet because i've had experiences with both you meet a really successful person you meet a really famous person you meet somebody who is completely happy or somebody who is you know truly believes in themselves even when you're like dude there's no way you're gonna pull that off and they truly believe it they're not just boasting they're puffing their chest out to me that is like you know that's a drug to be around somebody like that because i want to be like that i want to be truly happy i want to be truly confident and um and they they don't even have to try to show it it's just like it's on their face it's in the way they walk it's in the way they talk and um and i can contrast that to the way i think and i see oh that's the gap that's where i want to be so i think those are the two most i guess like intoxicating things in people what do you think is that the same for you or is that just a method yeah and i know a bunch of people like that and i'm like in both ways i'm like i'm exhausted i can't be around you anymore but then i crave it constantly and i crave you when you're gone yeah yeah you know what i mean like i've got like when my friends talk about working with travis so like are you gonna go work at his new company they're like he's trying to recruit me and i just can't do i can't go to war again but i'm just too worn out but like i miss it every day so it's like a it's a duality there but yeah i completely agree with you and i'm actually um reading this book yeah the laws of human nature uh in order to like learn a little bit more because i used to study this stuff constantly i would read books on influence and persuasion because i was like i can't build anything so i just have to be a leader of people and i've got to like persuade people to do this because i i can't do it i don't have the ability so i i got to bring some attributes to the table and so that's my thing oh there you go dan's reading it too so what do you so like i read the laws of human nature by robert greene which is about like how to like influence humans a little bit and how we think i like uh how to win friends that influence people and i like think and grow rich for self-confidence is there anything you like i don't know so book wise whatever maybe i don't know but this you just reminded me of something i read yesterday there's a quora story about this guy who interviewed at apple with steve jobs have you ever read the story no oh sorry i'm pulling it up right here so you can uh you can have the link but i was shaking my head no yeah podcast bro we got to have audio um so um okay so so there's this thing like so this guy uh writes this anonymous thing this might be by the way this might just be straight up like fan fiction so uh so like if i fell for some fan fiction you know my bad either way it was pretty inspiring this guy goes yeah i was at mit and um uh you know i was getting recruited by apple and i didn't want to work at apple i wanted to go do something else i don't know stay in school or like go to a different job he was like but you know people told me like okay just go apple go go interview see if you get the job see if you get an offer like that's good for you so he goes to apple and he's uh he's sitting in the interview and sure enough like they're asking a bunch of questions that just make him be like if this is your question i just definitely don't want to work here and then he's like then i heard this sort of like um sound on the other side of the like kind of the glass door or whatever the mirror and uh and uh you know steve jobs walks in and uh steve jobs walks in and he kind of like dismisses the vp who was like doing the interview and he looks he's like he sits down he doesn't look at me he looks at the sheet of questions and he's just reading them he's like like i don't know five six seven minutes go by he hasn't introduced himself he hasn't said a word to me he hasn't looked up and made eye contact he is just reading this list of interview questions and he's like kind of scoffing at them as he's reading them and he's just like you know muttering kind of like like you know stupid uh and so he and he basically that you know sort of the long story short is he goes um you know how would we ever expect somebody interesting to uh to work with us when we ask the most uninteresting questions and so he's like muttering that and so he um he he puts the paper down and he looks at the guy and he goes who are you and you go the guy kind of like answers like most people would or whatever he's like you know i'm tom i don't know his name let's pretend he's tom you know i'm tom uh you know you know i'm interviewing for the job here yeah i know what you're doing i said who are you who are you he's like uh you know honestly i don't even really want this job like you know like i'm not that interested in working at apple he's like he's i'm not asking if you're interested in the job i'm asking you who are right so he's like going back and forth and the guy's like look you know whatever he tries to answer the question and then steve's like why don't you want to work at apple and he goes uh honestly you know i just blah blah steve goes like take a walk with me right and steve jobs famous for like these walking meetings so he he's like okay like i guess so you know and he said he takes a walk with him and so they they walk around the sort of campus and he's like you can literally see like it's like he's got a like a gravity field around him like everywhere he walks people just clear the path uh because they don't want to like talk to him they don't want to like get in his way bother him or anything like that he's like we're talking and he's giving me the whole spiel like you know we're making some really great stuff here like we're really really great like you won't believe er just like kind of the like steve in the keynote he's doing the the kind of like build up he's not telling him anything yet uh but he's telling him it's really great he's like you got to meet john johnny ive right you can be johnny and they go into johnny ive's office and he's showing him cool stuff or whatever anyways the story ends with with the guy sort of like getting wrapped up in the like intoxication of steve jobs he's like dude i told you i don't want to work here i don't want to work here and steve jobs is like um give me a month it'll be the best month of your life um uh i will you know i'll pay you three times what your normal rate would be for the month you know for one month i'll make you pay you triple we'll get you a car or an apartment or whatever else um just say yes and like say yes and we're it's done the guy's like okay and he's like fantastic and he's like jennifer uh jennifer will help you from here and like jennifer yeah you know like whatever he like goes and introduces or he he leaves the guy for a second he's like okay jennifer's gonna help you jennifer now knows all the details about this whole situation asks no questions um you know has him sign a thing he's like what's my job title it's like you're a steve hire he's like who do i report to i guess you'll report to steve we don't know uh don't ask those questions those are not questions you want to ask steve and is like um okay cool but like uh i don't live here i live in pittsburgh so i gotta like move my stuff like um or no no he's like he's like you know i i just have kind of my suitcase with me they're like no no steve's arranging all of your stuff to be moved here he's like well i don't know if i'm gonna stay the month he's like that's okay we'll move it back if you decide not to steve prefers he wants you to have your stuff here and your apartment is across the street here's your keys and a car will be there waiting for you and he's like this was like an hour of total time had elapsed and somehow like the world had moved to make steve's like wish come true and so i don't know again this might just be fair do you think this might just be fan fiction and even if it is i [ __ ] love it it's a great like you know random ass tech fan fiction god i love that but if it's true how [ __ ] cool is that i i i find it hard to believe it's so cool and also there's no [ __ ] point to the story right like i read the story i was like what's the point of this story i didn't know it stuck in my head and i told you now and you know tens of thousands of listeners and i still don't know what the point of the story is excited from how [ __ ] cool is that if that happened i think it's sick and i've and and and to bring it back to like these personality things um culture to wrap it up any i mean you've got a good personality uh what do you any resources for like improving that i'll tell you one thing i do i think that the whole cult of personality ego thing that might work for some people where they're like i'm great this place is great we're gonna do great work i think that works i find that to be really hard in practice to like uh execute with a straight face and so the thing that i use as like maybe my stepping stone towards being more like that is i i do this exercise with anybody i work with um and in fact you know we met dan in miami this was the one dan wanted to chat about ideas for the podcast because he's trying to do his job he's like hey i have a bunch of ideas for how we can grow the pod and make it work better and we did that normally what i would do when i first bring anyone onto the team is i basically do like a dream exercise with them i'm like okay come to this off come to the come to the whiteboard room we go to the whiteboard and they expect me to like kind of outline their role or talk about the project i'm like no no like same sort of thing who are you who you're trying to be by the time you're done here this this job this job is like getting into a car right you're gonna have a bunch of it's going on a road trip you're gonna have a bunch of other people in the car with you we you know we're cool it's gonna be a fun hang the music is good the vibe is nice roll up the window you're gonna feel it feel the air going through you know through your hair okay we're trying to get to some destination and your job is not to be like focused on the car making the car as great as it can be you're recognize that every business every experience is just a vehicle to get you to some other like destination for yourself and so like what is that for you who are you today and who do you want to walk out of here as and i start getting them pumped talking about themselves and um usually people have a very hard time even having a vision for themselves right it's like it's normal to have a vision for the company and a mission for the company 9 out of 10 people maybe 99 out of 100 people don't have a vision for themselves or a mission for themselves right and uh and how crazy is that like yourself is a lot more important than than the the corporation you work for and so i try to like sketch that with them and that does two things one is um they realize that i care about them as a person uh and i'm here to like i'm gonna help them get where they wanna go right and then the second thing is i get to see how they're wired i get to see what makes them tick i get to see what they're motivated by so now when it comes time to get great you know great effort out of them i know what moves the needle for them personally um so that's the thing that's a thing i do that's like kind of in this realm i i i feel like i'm taking notes i dig this [ __ ] do you want to um just bang out a few quick ideas you want to start with you want to do let's do the top barrels let's do can i tell the story about hyper ice and then we'll talk about the ice barrels go for it had you heard about hyper ice before do you know this what is it so it's this thing you might have seen if you've ever seen anybody who's an athlete and um after they work out or whatever they're wearing they're not like going in an ice tub anymore they're wearing this black thing that's wrapped around their legs that like is pumping some air or compression or cooling into their like onto their body yeah um you know the first time you see it they it looks weird right they're like kind of like it's like they're the michelin man they have did you discover this from the guy who tweeted at us no who tweeted ass oh someone was like i want to send you guys hyper eye stuff oh no way uh maybe he listens to the pod that would be amazing but uh i don't know i just saw this because um a random random story but like i saw it because in the nba games now you always see nba players all of a sudden for the first time ever when they go to the bench to rest they don't just sit there and rest right like it used to be you go sit down and rest the camera doesn't even show you then the camera starts showing you because they want to show your facial reaction and then what happened in the jordan era was he's always drinking gatorade right he's a sponsored athlete gatorade gatorade gatorade inside the cup of gatorade is probably water but like he's holding a gatorade cup always right because gatorade wanted to be the way you refuel your body you know as a drink right they wanted that that that niche and by partnering with all the sports team it was sort of a genius thing right uh when the super bowl ends they dumped the gatorade on the coach right they created these uh branding moments and so now every year at the super bowl hundreds of millions of people see the gatorades uh you know canister how genius is that so i saw a new thing that caught my attention and it was lebron went to the bench and he took this ferragun looking thing out he started you know like self-massaging using this gun on his leg to like recover while he was resting and i was like oh that's cool and it wasn't a theragan it was like a different device so i went looked it up as thing called hypervolt and hypervolt is made by hyper ice so what is this company so it's the same company that makes those those cooling like uh straps or i don't know what you would call it like this giant black thing you put it's a sleeve you put on your leg around your leg and it's like a way to ice your legs after you work out and so here's the back story there's a guy who's like a teacher and a high school basketball coach and um he was you know sort of always he was just a coach and he was sort of thinking about recovery because you know you get into your 30s and now when you're after you work out or after you play basketball you're gonna like not be able to walk great the next day and uh so he was sort of experimenting like is there anything better than just icing like basically he thought to himself what do the pro athletes do he's like they ice they ice their knees they ice their ankles and if you watch them do it it always looked the same it was like a giant bag of ice yeah with an ace bandage around the top of it and it literally looks like a wounded person right like you look like you're hurt if somebody was to draw a cartoon of somebody with a bum shoulder they would draw this giant ice bag on the top and um and you know and and basically uh bandage wrapped around it so he's like that sucks like you're not like broken uh you're recovering could we make recovery look cool and be more efficient so he starts trying to design a ice wrap that's less inconvenient and looks cooler so he's like oh it'd be cool if it just like you just strapped on to you and it wasn't a bag of ice that was like you know getting wet everywhere if it was just cold and um you know so he starts working on it and his friend is a guy who trains with kobe or he's like a the coach of a little college that kobe used to train at uh irvine in the summers and so his friend sees his thing and goes dude you've got to show this to kobe and he's like oh okay yeah sure and he's like you know a week later he's like dude i told kobe kobe was icing his knees after after we did a workout and i told him about your thing he wants to see it can you come so he goes he shows kobe and kobe says two things he's like first you know some product feedback like when we're icing uh you know the pressure keeps escaping out of the top so like it's not working it's not compressing tight enough so can you fix that the guy's like got his notepad out he's like yeah yeah for sure and kobe's like also um the name [ __ ] sucks he's like oh uh okay uh hyper ice you know actually i named it after you your favorite chew and my favorite shoe is like the hyperdunks uh by nike so i thought hyper ice and kobe's like name sucks and uh but he ended up keeping it and so he ended up doing product development with kobe and kobe made him a deal with kobe goes look if you can make it better than my current thing i'll wear it on the bench so you'll get free kind of exposure you know from this thing you see these pictures of kobe with icing his shoulder using hyper ice so kobe does it people see it on the bench more athletes started asking more lakers start asking for it now other teams players start asking for it he builds a brand around this and what he's building is nike for recovery so which is like the greatest that i mean that's wonderful that's wonderful because that um calm he says that he wants to be the nike for meditation or nightmare for the mind yeah and that makes sense i get that i think that's cool i think this is even better it's even better exactly because what is nike nike was all about the performance when you're on the court when you're on the field wear this you can run faster jump higher blah blah and then that became a super competitive space how do we get you to perform better right wear this wear this under armor you know um you know use these cleats whatever it is um but nobody was really he's like you would see them wear all this gear sell billions of dollars of merchandise by wearing it on the court and then when they got off the court they were using ace bandages and plastic bags of ice what is a brilliant um insight brilliant right [ __ ] he's like dude i had no idea no intention to go into business i was a happy teacher and coach but like you know i just sort of stumbled on this path really and so now hyper ice they do they have the ice product they have the theragun type product i'm looking at it and and i like this company because their shit's expensive and i would consider we're going to talk about another thing that's expensive i would consider buying this because i think expensive good health equals good yeah like when i see that and it like loves music equals good expensive equals good right yeah like everything i their branding is tight it's a well executed thing so let me give you some numbers last year 100 million in revenue is what they said they were projecting 200 million this year it raised last year at a 700 million valuation so it's gonna be you know if this continues to work this will be a billion dollar plus company that was started in the way that i just described how [ __ ] cool is that story i love that story and i love this concept we have an idea you have an idea and i have a couple other ideas about what else you can do here but here's the framework the framework is athletes are the one of the greatest marketing vehicles of all time go look at the shoe companies if you want proof of that uh go look at gatorade go look at who mcdonald's and coke will sponsor it's the top athletes even though they're obviously not eating mcdonald's and drinking coke in order to perform their best but that's that's they're the best marketing vehicle and the native placement is what matters so it's one thing to say you know i'm holding a coke and or you know mcdonald's in a commercial it's another thing to watch them actually drinking you know from a gatorade cup during the thing or wearing hyper ice after they train because that's feels real it feels like this is what the pros this is what top performers actually do so looking at the pregame and the post game how much more is there if you walked into a locker room before and after a game what are all the other things you'll see them doing and then how could you turn those from unbranded moments into branded moments right beats by dre is a perfect example of this beats by dre sold to apple for three billion dollars one of the reasons why is they made headphones well all right there's already a bunch of headphones out there there's sonos there's sennheiser there's all these other ones and um what beats by dre did was they gave it to all the athletes that they you know drew was had the kind of hip-hop roots and then all their commercials if you remember was colin kaepernick showing up to the game the fans are booing him he puts the beats by dre on he goes into the zone he can't hear the noise all he hears is his music and then he goes to the game right they intentionally always put it in the lockers of all the players so when they're doing their interviews they have headphones around their neck they have headphones hanging right behind them right they're walking into the arena that has become like before every nba game you they show the walk-in what is lebron wearing uh when he walks in so those become branded moments where maybe you can build products around that and he obviously got all the right people to invest i'm looking at the crunch base it's all athletes fernando tatis ricky fowler doc rivers deandre jordan uh what's that one uh naomi osaka osaka yeah uh this guy's gonna crush it this is the greatest thing ever and so tell me about this ice barrel thing because i think you have a cool story around this uh so i was at a friend's house i've talked about him he lives a few doors down from me and his name's andy and he started this company called student loan here i believe and he sold it for a lot of money 60 million bucks and i was at his house for lunch my wife and i and he had this huge barrel and i was like what the [ __ ] is this thing he goes it says company that i just bought a large stake in and i'm helping them get their [ __ ] right and it's this barrel that you hop into and it's just an ice barrel that's all it is is a nice barrel but there's one pretty shocking thing about it it's two thousand dollars so like i'm in this text group with you well set this up in in the way that that you're you're you're an athlete right people saw the quads they saw quadzilla in the in the twitter funny that picture right they saw the quads uh you were a track jack athlete when you were done training did you ever ice yeah did you do ice baths yes and what did you do for in your post game if i had walked in the locker room looking for startup ideas what would i have seen you doing oh i mean you're just sitting in the ice bath you're just sitting there the ice bath made of it's not a barrel well they use like trash cans typically like literally like you'll use like a shitty trash can or you'll use these massive plastic buckets but typically like a trash can right so it's this unbranded thing that the athletes are doing to recover and it's like this literally like a 64 gallon black trash can which is kind of gross of an idea that that's what do i do to recover i get in a [ __ ] trash can right so like that was the opportunity to make that sexy and cool in a branded moment and that's what these guys did it's a giant cool looking like barrel so you know it's like like a like where you would store like whiskey or something like that and there's actually a few reasons why i think this is going to be big so the best example i could think of is yeti there's two examples yeti and weather tech weather tech makes floor mats boring silly thing i buy whenever i buy a car i immediately buy weather tech maps yeah right away and they like you think that these are like kind of forgotten things same with yeti yeti was just you know everyone has a coleman cooler growing up they just made it cool and they like are 4x more expensive than the nearest competitor and yet we all do it and this what's it called ice barrel. basically if i was going to distill their formula it's like double the value quadruple the price right like that's the way i would i would like describe it plastic thing but the reason why it's cool is those trash cans if you're like a a big guy like i kind of am like you can't like push down on the thing otherwise it's going to like collapse yes and so you gotta like getting that sucks and it's and it's inconvenient it's not that inconvenient but it's inconvenient but for the type of person that ice baths like if you're gonna like make it a little bit more convenient and it's two grand i'm like [ __ ] it whatever i don't care like like five hundred dollars and two thousand 000 is like kind of like the same thing to me a little bit when it comes to like health and fitness right so i'll buy it if i if i'm into that and so it doesn't really look that spectacular but when your shit's two grand you don't need to sell that many of them i mean if you're selling 40 a day what's that 40 a day is 80k a day in revenue times 30 uh that's uh 2.4 million dollars a month which is 36 million dollars a year you got to sell very little and that's kind of why i like this business i think and and i think i talked to him about it i i he says it costs a lot of money uh because it they it costs them a lot of money right so like it's a pretty interesting business are you bullish on that i love that idea i wouldn't have been as bullish until i looked at it through this through this lens now i see now i see the value the other ideas that i think are like this so if i was gonna be like okay what else what else can i do um we've talked before about saunas i think saunas are going to agree saunders are just going to keep exploding in popularity 100 agree joe rogan is kind of like the lebron in this case who's been touting them but a lot of athletes use saunas i had one kind of like i had to keep one on amazon for a grand it was called the barcelona yes exactly so uh i want you know like where is our spanish sponsorship i'm waiting for my home sauna sponsorship uh you know i think a lot of people are gonna install home saunas there's also like other like technologies like that like i forgot like red red light therapy and some other [ __ ] like that i don't know what they are but i like to always educate me and then sell me right that's what you got to do if you're i tried buying a um sensory deprivation tank so i used to go to this place in the mission in san francisco and i'd pay 50 and you like sit in this thing that kind of looks like a tanning bed and it's filled with water and salt and you just float for uh like an hour and it was quite nice i loved it i tried to buy one i was like sure i was like you know i've got space what i'll put one in my garage how much is it it's like 20 000 or i mean it's like a [ __ ] ton and it doesn't have to cost that much money so so here's the why why is it i don't need a full body tank that works but if somebody made a dope helmet that was like go to the place of silence it's like what you go in this thing and you're not gonna hear a [ __ ] thing or you're gonna hear specific sounds like you know like calming sounds whatever it is um i think somebody could sell a helmet that is gonna like basically change your state sort of like the sensory deprivation idea um as just a helmet i think that would be kind of cool as a random idea all right ice barrel what else so we got sauna we got ice barrel we got sensory deprivation here's another one i bought these little things uh so man i could go pick them up but they're basically these little inflatable um pods so it's like a little inflatable uh plastic thing that i saw lebron using so lebron has his like warm-ups that's become part of the television programming as they show lebron before the game what is he doing to get ready and i saw he was always standing on or kneeling on these two little clear plastic things and one time when he was recovering from injury the reporter kind of showed lebron's been using this thing it's this instability ball and the idea is like a bosu ball basically you when you stand on it it gives you an uneven un like uneven surface right because most of our weight training we are on flat you know hard stable surfaces but then when you do athletic things you're not always landing at the exact yeah as that so he does his training on top of that he does all his warm-ups there and it like warm ups all his sort of like little micro muscles and microfibers they all get activated when he just spends time squatting on this hand standing on this balancing on this same thing with steph curry for his ankles he does the same thing and so i think that little products like that can work uh ben sent me another one of these that's like a medicine ball that's filled with water so you take a traditional piece of equipment like a medicine ball it's just hot it's just you know solid and heavy when you put water in it and you move it from side to side the water you know your arms move and then the water sloshes in that direction and then if you're trying to move back the water is moving one way you're moving the other so it's a good resistance training and so i think water-based uh water-based training things if the athletes are doing that i think that's kind of interesting and people want to buy what the athletes buy the other is braces knee braces ankle braces shoulder wraps wrist wraps you know like anything that is um like injury prevention i think could be sexed up because they are usually uh pretty like basic stuff right now there's a when you're talking i'll keep googling but there's a so you know how when you get surgery you uh have your head like you've never had this but you know like if you've ever seen your parents or friends get like a shoulder surgery you have to keep your shoulder in this like particular type of cast where your arm stays up high the l yes so there's this brand that is a startup that is like remaking those and it's called like what was it called it's like champion sports or something where they did a whole thing around these soft casts so like when you have like a walking boot they made like cool walking boots and that's actually a great one it's like a cooler walking boot and they built this business all around this and that's actually really interesting as well there was a woman who uh i don't remember the name of it but i'll try to find it maybe we'll put it in the show notes there's a woman who uh was like a designer of some kind and she got like paralyzed and went in a wheelchair and then she like changed her life mission she designed herself like the coolest looking wheelchair that didn't look like you know you're you know if you're younger like how do you make a wheelchair look slick it had like cup holders a place for your phone it was just like nice looking it wasn't the kind of like blue and metal like kind of look that you see at a hospital and she just made like an awesome looking wheelchair and it's like hey look if you're in a wheelchair um like okay but let's make it as good as we can and she was like this is my new life mission i thought that was pretty great too by the way it's called game ready check it out go to gameready.com it looks like they're acquired um they were doing 35 million dollars a year when they got acquired this is the ice thing yeah wow it only got acquired for 65 million dollars but yeah go to game ready they it's they have ice stuff but they also have like post surgery equipment uh kind of interesting right yeah same ways i think that i think there's an opportunity the brainstorm would be go hang out with an athlete follow them pre-game post game during the game during timeouts and just look for what are all the things that everybody's doing that's unbranded and then can you make a higher quality branded version of this can you create um you know can you and then you use that marketing strategy of the trickle down you give the athletes the coolest [ __ ] other people see it and you sell it to the wannabe athletes you're not making the money from the athletes themselves you're making the money off of right like ice barrel what they need is they need they need you to see this in pro locker rooms and then he then they need every high school to be like oh that's what you know that's what the lakers used when they're recovering or that's what the you know the um the patriots use in their locker room dude i feel like um i i gotta email this guy and be like hey we'll just give you a shout out we're definitely gonna get this guy's sales it's a small company i don't think they i think it's only like two employees they're definitely gonna see a bump from this and we're gonna have to ask them how many people bought because iceberry.com uh just go there right now and buy their [ __ ] and actually by the way it's not two grand i got it wrong it's uh 1200 yes 1200 uh yeah they're like thanks for the shout out [ __ ] you uh you made it seem even more expensive than it is yeah i thought it was two grand it's 1200 maybe the big one is 2 000 anyway it's cool it's a cool thing i'm excited to actually see how this works their their website looks pretty slick what is this i don't know this looks great so those are some ideas uh yeah i think that might be it peace out we actually have like way more but we're going to save those for later yeah dan what'd you think yeah so i like the episode i like the co-working section i think you guys bring a unique perspective to that and having worked and we work it's exciting to know that there are some i guess new opportunities and that whole concept isn't going to die uh with wework what was it what was the absolute best part of the episode the best part of the episode i like the recovery stuff i have one of the the knockoff um like uh hypervolts or whatever i like using that i haven't done a uh an ice barrel before but i have some friends that have done like those like cold chambers or whatever you do like the two minutes inside yeah you know what else blows that up by the way wim hof wim hof has gotten really popular in like you know some knee circles i guess but uh he's all about cold cold submerging yourself and cold would you pay 3500 to go to his house and train with him wim hof you can do it maybe i i s it's something like two or three or four thousand dollars i think i would do that it's not the money it's more the time like yeah if i had a little bit of time yeah i would love to do that that'd be great i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back

this is why on all my landing pages i always ask for email first i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back what's up we're back from miami and we got a new nickname i am sean fury he is the vanilla gorilla and we are back uh we had to wing it this episode because we had a guest cancelled last minute but i think it turned out pretty good so sam what do we talk about yeah so this episode actually turned out i think to be one of my favorite in a long time we probably discussed maybe 20 or 30 ideas um the ideas start about halfway through but we have a bunch of interesting ideas that are scattered throughout so a few things that we've discussed so businesses that we've both invested in recently including an event business we've talked about slingshot ideas so slingshot ideas that are ideas that have been kind of under the radar because of kovid but now that there's a lot of pent-up demand for events for interaction things like that these are going to be slunk shot is that the right word slung shot slung shooted back into popularity we talked about litigation finance so basically there's a whole bunch of people that will finance lawsuits and then take a cut the winning uh winning uh settlement kind of interesting we talked about secondhand stores shockingly that's actually it seems like a huge idea and then finally we wrapped up with one of the best sean stories i've ever heard where we talked about door-to-door sales trust me it's going to leave you fired up it's in the last 15 minutes it's awesome we were supposed to have bill smith from hello landing on i got an email from his pr team literally 60 seconds before we were supposed to hit record saying he's not gonna make it i don't know what what we're gonna do today i'm so angry about that oh my gosh i'm frustrated i gotta give you credit you uh you replied back to the email to the pr person the pr person 60 seconds before the podcast is supposed to record right we're in like the sound room in a green room getting sound check and uh it's like hey folks uh sorry not gonna be able to make it today looking forward to rescheduling and um it just goes are you kidding one minute before the podcast no context and i thought that are you kidding was uh very ballsy i would have just i would have just ate it just took the slap and uh i think you rightfully you're rightfully like what i mean okay so i'm reading this book called non-violent communication i'm reading it for i'm reading it for two reasons the first reason is i've gotten repeated feedback from you and abreu and my coworkers that i have a temper i don't think i have a temper so i'm trying to get that and my wife sarah the second reason and this feedback is pissing me off i i yeah i i think i could be a little hot and hey you gotta say i was with you the whole week we went to austin miami and you were like an angel you were totally patient you were just being grateful the whole time it was amazing and then you i think you even noticed at the end i was going to tell you and then you go i've been i've been really kind this whole trip i'm feeling really kind and grateful so i guess we can um we can talk about that but uh yeah so bill smith sorry brother like i have a feeling i have a feeling it wasn't bill's fault that that's what i would bet i bet he's got people and i bet that he screwed that up uh they screwed it up not him but i uh i replied you know what happens like sometimes you you don't sort of you don't really think about the other side you're just going about your day one thing is rolling over this other thing comes up and you're just like uh we got to move that call thing we got to move that podcast thing and um and so you know i've i've been on that side where you know i don't sort of fully you know appreciate that the other side of it has you know there's a lot of prep that goes into a podcast like multiple people on board and timing and then you need to record because you have to release and then you're preparing for him you're researching him you're not researching other topics so then you got to go live without them but look we're not big shots yet i would love to be a big shot we're not big shots yet but i would say we are big enough shots that like someone like it would be wise to take this at least seriously and give like a little bit of a heads up i'm not saying that we're like big deals but like it's a good it's a good enough platform he wouldn't have rescheduled tim ferriss a minute before the pot is that what you're saying oh definitely not look i'm not saying that we're big deals but i am and we are um all right now let's just roll so i hope you come back so i don't know what we're gonna talk about but you wanna do a recap of this weekend uh yeah let's do it so we had a fun week we went to i went to austin which is your hometown stayed at your house not my hometown my where your current town yeah and we did a live show uh i don't know about 100 people were able to fit into the venue we did it at the appsumo office with noah kagan that was fun then we hopped on a plane next morning 5am and uh got to miami where the bitcoin conference was happening so there was like 10 to 20 000 people in town for you know this bitcoin thing and we were there for our miami show and i think i don't know a few hundred people i don't know how many ended up being maybe i don't know what do you think dan 250 300 people something like that well 300 people rsvp'd but i think or no sorry show up yeah something like that yeah so 200 people showed up or so did the live show there met a bunch of cool people people who flew in from paraguay and you know all different types of places to attend and um yeah then we hung out and we flew home so that was a that's what happened but there were some interesting things that were going on give me your kind of like what do you think would be the most interesting one or two things to talk about from the trip i have a so uh i have a bunch and and thank you bill smith so i'm just rattling this off the top of the dome there's no research here but um the airports and hotel situation in both miami and in austin bananas absolutely crazy we went to the airport i think we got there at about 6 a.m we left my house at 5 30 i think and it was like an hour long wait including tsa pre-check to get past security and it was booming i went to miami the reason i came home early is because my hotels i went to book on hotel tonight and they all got canceled for some reason and i couldn't find a single hotel in between the ranges of 200 and 2 000 in miami i had to go stay at a family uh family's house travel is crushing it right now i'm i'm just shocked at how booming everything is yeah and also i came from california and um in california there's just like covered you know precaution everywhere and as soon as we got to austin you were like oh yeah this is my favorite like you know coffee shop slash bar i don't even know what the place was a lazarus or whatever it is whatever it's called and we walk in and i was like it's like stepping into a time machine i was like whoa everybody's just chilling everybody's hanging out at a restaurant indoors no masks uh ever some people had their mask on that's cool that's their choice and other people didn't um but it just it was like wow life has really gone on and people are back to normal and because in florida and texas i think they're probably two of the most like kind of forward states as far as like returning to the norm and then you know california i come back and it's sort of the same thing you know you if your nose peeks out of your mask you get three dirty looks and uh i'm i'm over the mask mask time i'm like i'm vaccinated let's uh let's roll here yeah so that was a takeaway um with some covet stuff my thing where do you think that do you see any opportunities right now so like you had heard about pent up demand and how the economy is going to bounce back after seeing miami after seeing um austin airport um i've seen a little bit of new york it's just it's booming where do you think the opportunities are do you have anything off the top of your head that you're looking at uh i'm glad i bought airbnb stock when it was down because i think everybody's going to do very well because i do think people are pretty roaring to get back out there and doing things traveling traveling especially i know a lot of people that haven't seen their family in like you know a year and a half type of thing so i think that people are going to be be coming back out that's not that like you know insightful of an answer it's just sort of obvious um and i think that a lot of things that we we did as a necessary evil um are gonna go away people are gonna ditch those with quickness the same way i was ready to just ditch my mask as soon as it was okay to do it um i think you know all the remote learning stuff is gonna go away um pretty quickly because people if it wasn't a better experience it's like going to the graveyard as soon as you don't have to do it and uh i think remote school is one where every parent every kid i've ever talked to they had to do remote like you know zoom school they are not like oh you know i really really enjoy you know school from home like there's people who enjoy work from home i don't know anybody that enjoys school from home so i think that's that side is like gonna take a big hit did you see this company so i'm going to talk about a startup real quick um that i just invested in i bet you looked at it as well it was called mary have you heard of mary it's be married.com no tell me about it uh so ankur so basically i'm friends with uh this guy named ankur who's a successful entrepreneur and he invests in stuff and he just sends me interesting stuff i thought you were on that list because you maybe i just missed it or i think i have a feeling you missed it and so there's this co so i'm basically i'm on the lookout for companies that are uh going to be take taking advantage we have to come up with a cute name for this like pent-up demand because it's like what are people going to care about right now so jason calacanis had a good phrase where he goes slingshot startups they had a setback they were pulled back during covid but it like it's like a slingshot when you when you when you pull it back it's yes it's gone backwards but it's building up this momentum to slingshot forward and i thought i liked that that was a good little slingshot startup so i'm looking at like event event related stuff um i think sex related stuff is going to be quite interesting what does that mean uh what are those two examples i invested in one company called fitness ai and this was like a app you use when you go to the gym so it's like a trainer when you're at the gym it would be like hey cool like it knows your progression so it basically say it tracks all your reps so it knows what weight you need to do next to get the next to get the maximum gains over like a few month period of time now when covet hit jim's clothes his whole app became like useless overnight and so he had to re-architect the whole app to do at in-home fitness but the reason i would say is it's not that this startup necessarily benefited from it but you got to see what different startups are made of when you saw the entrepreneurs you know pivot the plane mid-flight and find a new path and actually start growing at a time where they should have been having a setback another example is there's these guys who keep emailing me um guru hotel they were a yc startup and they were you know software for hotels to increase their bookings and focus in latin america and of course you know covert hits nobody's booking hotels their business should really struggle and like they just made all these tweaks and all these adjustments so that they first stayed flat and then actually started to grow um at a time when their business should have cratered and many lesser less determined entrepreneurs less adaptable entrepreneurs would have uh would have gone under and so i think it was a great the great filter it weeded out the entrepreneurs and you got to see the entrepreneurs who actually succeeded despite the circumstances and those are the ones i think worth betting on what's guru hotel about i don't know exactly what they do they basically i think what it is is it's like shopify for a hotel so most hotel websites suck so what they did was they just make they make your hotel's website higher converting and higher upselling and so you're going to get an incremental 10 to 15 in revenue because instead of paying some you know your nephew to build a wordpress website for your your your hotel and it hasn't changed in eight years and you you know you don't even touch it because you don't know how to code it um they basically take over the front end website for your hotel and in doing so they generate more revenue for you and then they take a cut or they take it that sounds pretty great to me um have you heard of mind body you know mind body yeah so mind body um they're publicly traded they were started in 2000 so they've been around for a minute and basically they kind of started out doing that a little bit just helping a a yoga instructor i think it's mostly like it's health stuff yeah so it's basically like yoga studios pilates studios stuff like that and they became the website and the booking system and payment system for all those um physical uh like locations yeah crazy good company um kind of quietly i think they're based out of san luis obispo so they're not silicon valley and so they've probably been quietly crushing it uh and what's this called hotel guru guru hotel yeah oh they should call the other yeah they shouldn't they should switch it it should be hotel gurus uh they should switch it's like so obvious when you said it i hadn't even thought about it yeah they they they need to change that guru hotel oh no never mind rescind all five compliments they uh well like i think there's a mind body component here of like you just create the first thing and then next next next xxx next so i uh are you gonna invest in that company uh maybe like they keep sending me updates and it all sounds good but i just have this inherent thing that the best startups don't reach out randomly to non-super famous investors like me so unfortunately and this is like this is kind of a screwed up thing if a startup is reaching out to me to try to make room i already discount 20 that doesn't mean i don't do it but i discount 20 how good it is even when it looks good so yeah i know i'm in anybody else i'm the same way i'm like oh you you're willing to like it's like that's what i felt like when i was dating like oh you like me uh something something's bad here right this is crazy um so there's there's this company called mary i just invested in like i said we send it to you and i'm not sure if this is gonna be the biggest thing but i think it could definitely be a very profitable investment it's called uh mary m-e-r-r-o-i did you go to it it looks like a first planet be married.com um i'll tell you why i'm interested but i'll tell you first what it does so what it does is you need to organize an event they've uploaded i don't know how maybe there's a huge database uh out there but they've uploaded massive amounts of uh renderings or like floor plans of event space and then they make it really easy to drag and drop different tables and chairs and whatever you need for a wedding or a conference and you can outline what the event is going to look like and you do it in 3d because somehow the floor blue it looks like it looks like the sims so it's like you take it you have the venue and then it lets you upload like circle table chairs banquet chairs you know like speaker like uh podium or whatever right it looks like the sims you make a little 3d rendering exactly and the reason i invested in this was because of something that andrew wilkinson said on this podcast he called something an airport business i think he called uh what's that thing he owns dribble yeah he owns this thing called dribble and where dribble is is uh or i think he was referring to dribble when he was we're talking about airport business but basically with dr uh with with an airport you arrive at the airport and you're there you have to be there for three to four hours uh you're gonna buy whatever they have you're gonna if you're there it's very easy for that airport to sell you candy a magazine you're a captive audience yes you're a captive audience and what mary did is they made it where they uploaded all of these venues and so people who are executing weddings can go on there and pay a fee to use their software to drag and drop and like organize stuff and then what they've done is so the vendor can come on and put their the stuff that they want to sell so like certain types of chairs whether it's for rent or to buy it could be on there and then as the um event planner is on there doing their thing that they can sell just the event planner loads and loads and loads of different stuff so they can make money through affiliate they can make money through subscription fees they can make money through a lot of different stuff that they're on there and the reason why i invested in this is i think that this is a boring boring thing that could work quite well and uh there's gonna be a massive pent-up demand for events and so we put a little bit of money into it we'll see if it works but i love the business of houzz you know house h-o-u-z-z i've i've heard of it and i think you used that or something like that for your your house right no i use something like that yeah so i use what houses you probably don't know houses probably the audience is probably majority women it's a uh you basically can design your kitchen or your bedroom on houzz and they make like a billion dollars a year through affiliate feeds it's quite amazing and it's a it's a multi-billion dollar company but it's kind of been quiet in the background it's kind of amazing what i used was uh what the [ __ ] did i use uh i use this service where you take a picture of your house mods yeah i took a picture uh this thing where you take a picture of your house and then they uh you pay 300 per room so i think i paid like 1200 bucks a designer designs it and then if i choose to i can purchase all these stuff that they're telling me to buy or i just go buy stuff on my own that kind of looks like it right by the way i like these models where i don't know about you but for me whenever it's like hey you get the free consultation and ideas and then it's up to you if you buy them and at the beginning i'm always like sweet let me get the free expert advice and like i'm not gonna buy the things that's how i go in and then as soon as i see it i'm like oh that looks really good like i guess i could just push this button and just order these items right like i could just buy these things and so it ends up being where they i go in knowing eyes wide open on the model like it's like nerd wallet it's like cool i go in i read the blog post about the credit cards i'm not gonna like just pick one of these credit cards right off here necessarily because i kind of know you know there's like an affiliate thing but uh but then i do because it's so convenient and there's something to that when i was selling my house it was the same thing with staging they're like cool like we're going to we're going to do all this work to give you these three free options on which one you want to do and then as soon as you see it you're like ah okay give me the give me the expensive one i'll do it it looks so much better um and so you know it sort of breaks you over time like a like the puppy clothes where they give you the puppy they let you keep it for the weekend and you're like great i'll just play with this puppy for the weekend and then by by sunday night you're like this puppy's never leaving my house i didn't know that was a thing um you never heard that in sales no puppy clothes basically you give them the thing and then instead of having them opt-in you have them if okay you can opt out if you want and nobody ever opts out do you uh what are what are some other slingshot startups that you're seeing um or or slingshot opportunities so the slingshot so it has to be something that was set back during covid so what was set back during covet i think phys physical anything physical retail schools travel hospitality like we just said um there's other things that are like you know like concerts and stuff like that i think those are i think those sports games concerts i think those are all gonna come back so i'll give you one which is um sports games so the nba playoffs is going on right now and um i always wondered would people have kind of like ptsd from kovad where they don't want to be even when it's safe they just don't want to be close to other people without you know in confined areas um but these aren't sold out you know as many people as they'll let in it's packed people are going nuts uh they're having a good time and you know it just feels good to be back in a high energy place again with a whole bunch of other screaming you know lunatics and so but i think what happened is i think that it's sort of like the nba franchise or the the league had to get pretty had to get like double resilient because all of a sudden this thing it just took for granted which is all this ticket revenue went away for like a year and so now they open their mind up to well what other revenue stream should we have should we allow sports betting should we like should we do that should we sponsor things that we weren't sponsoring before should we do nfts oh okay cool you know nba top shot we'll do nfts as a source of revenue so i think it's pretty interesting that i think all these like pro sports are going to bounce back because they were already a premium in-person experience and now they were kind of lazy before at innovating they didn't have to innovate and covet made them innovate the fan experience and the like business model and i think you know we should see some some good things come from that last night so did you watch the logan paul floyd mayweather fight i watched a little bit of it yeah a little bit really i was in a warehouse where we didn't have uh streaming internet very strong and so i you know it was choppy but i got to see the last two rounds only so it was it was like it was exciting so basically if you were gonna go i was gonna go but then i realized i didn't two things happened one someone gave me tickets and then right before i was about to go get the tickets they were like also like are you gonna mention us in the hustle and i was like no not a chance uh i thought this was a gift thank you but no thank you i didn't know there were strings attached i'm out so i gave up the tickets and also i didn't like miami so i came home early right it wasn't for me uh not for me at all i i i can see why some people like it it ain't for me um so last night basically logan paul is a six foot two probably he weighed in at 190 probably fought at 2010 210 205 huge guy and he fought floyd mayweather who's 44. backspa best boxer of all time but 44 and 160 pounds at his heaviest right and i thought for sure floyd was going to win um and ended up being basically a draw because they don't declare a winner because it's an exhibition but floyd did not do well and logan did as good as he possibly could have which is he didn't get knocked out and from what i understand floyd did the floyd thing where he just didn't do anything he just played defense he just let the clock run out he didn't did he was it that he was unsuccessful on offense or he just didn't try any offense because he didn't need to because he got paid either way i think he's old well i think that he i think age it was a factor here and i think that he uh sides the factor here um i think that the reason why everyone says floyd lost because a loss or floyd is not winning and not knocking him out everyone including me thought for sure logan's gonna get knocked out he didn't he did great he's a winner the guy like went from vining to fighting floyd in a stadium total winner but what he did before the show was logan is known for like collecting pokemon cards and there's this whole trend if you don't know about this on of unwrapping cards and so i actually love watching unwrapping nba cards i don't even like the nba but the title will be like unboxing a michael jordan card i think it's awesome i love doing it i love watching this logan has this whole thing where he does it and he in his he created a necklace that was basically the most expensive or most rare pokemon card of all time and he like put it in some type of like safety thing and he wore it around his neck as he was walking out and what i think is gonna happen it was what i would what looked like what he's setting up is that he is um gonna sell that and i think that what his brother did jake paul was they during the knockout when he when his brother fought a few weeks ago they had an nft right after the fight right and i think that them selling the memorabilia right away after the fight is a brilliant idea and that started a little bit with nfts and but i think that that idea is here to stay uh that's interesting yeah so so just for the context so he basically had like the way that most uh fighters come out they come out with their gold chain their you know they come out with diamonds on and he basically had a sort of diamond chain but the pendant was a charizard a one million dollar charizard card that was laminated as a holographic charizard rare uh blah blah blah and uh he's like i'm wearing a million dollars on my chest right now and it just helps because he's already invested in pokemon so him giving it that sign and giving it that credibility using the platform made his own collection worth more and made that individual one worth more because it now has the story of this is the one that you saw on tv uh not just the fact that it's a rare charizard court so smart smart move all around um these guys know how to make money floyd had his mask sponsored he he had uh he had like everything sponsored on his page mask was sponsored by ethereumsomething.org like did you see that yeah i don't know what it was it was it was crazy so his hat his mask everything was sponsored as he walked out because these guys this was a an all-time money grab it was great so i want to tell you a cool nft thing most nft things by the way not that cool you you you have to explain what we're adding so many listeners sean that you have to actually say what ft is because i think like a lot of people don't understand i've got i've got an aunt and a mother-in-law listening you gotta explain what an nft is all right nft is a piece of art that is uh digital that's the way that most people are using it today it stands for this thing from crypto so you've heard of bitcoin you might have heard of ethereum ethereum lets you create this thing called an nft an nft just means it's a unique uh a unique thing so for example if i have a 100 bill and sam has 100 bill we could swap it and we would just know they're all the same 100 bills the same as the other but if i have a piece of art on my wall sam has a piece of art on his wall we can't just swap it because my art is unique and his art is unique and they're not going to be worth the same amount um even if we had you know sort of the same pair of of jordans you know they might be in different condition or different years whatever it is so an nft is more like a pair of fancy you know basketball shoes it's what something that collectors will will own it can be used in many other ways but the majority is that people are using to collect sort of to create and collect digital art they got popular because um a whole bunch of people who were what i call crypto rich right they made their money on bitcoin they made their money on ethereum they got tons of money from that and when nfts came out they were using they were using their their winnings to buy nfts and so they were buying nfts for literally millions and millions of dollars so you uh and it blew people's minds it's like wait that's just an image on a computer screen why are you buying it for millions of dollars and they would say you know what's the mona lisa but some uh you know but some paint on a piece of paper right art has art its value is in the meaning that people give it so anyways nft's got popular they've had sort of a crash since since the hype cycle because everybody everybody poured in thought there was a chance to make money and then uh you know it's down the nft market's down like 80 plus percent right now from where it was just a few months ago so it's been very up and down but i'll tell you something cool um that the people who are not there's a group with any technology there's a hype cycle where people jump in just to try to make a buck and then there's like the people who just believed in it the whole time and when the crash happens they stay they don't go away and so i'll tell you a cool nft example so do you know who lamelo ball is a basketball player from the ball family and they're kind of like a little obnoxious like the kardashians of like nba so go to lamelloball.i so i met this guy or you know actually i haven't met him yet ben met him uh because we thought this project sounded really awesome so he partnered up with lamela ball and lamella ball created his own nft now here's how it works the website looks awesome yeah yeah exactly very good website so um there's there's like four different types it's like he turned lamella ball essentially into a pokemon card okay so he you can collect these different labellable types of of cards now what do they do well the twist here the reason i think it's kind of cool is that this is called a dynamic nft meaning it uh most nfts when you make it it is what it is the image or the video is what it is it stays that way until the end of time a dynamic one will update or upgrade based on things that happen so what this is is it's sort of like a bet on the player so you can buy one of these you can buy the mvp card and today it's worth not so much because he's never won an mvp but if in his career he ever wins an mvp the card will like um like evolve like a pokemon card it'll upgrade uh because it has been unlocked because the thing actually happened in real life so it's like today you're betting these cheap options will lamella ball ever win the nft will he ever win mvp will he ever win rookie of the year will he win a championship and if he does your asset that you bought will dynamically upgrade because it takes in the data from from the real world that hey this event has happened and it is now worth more and it could do more and specifically just to like kind of round it out but the price isn't it's not worth more necessarily right well and you know it's like most things right like if uh if i buy a michael jordan rookie card and then michael jordan becomes the greatest player of all time that rookie card's worth more than it was when he was a rookie and nobody knew how good he would be how do they literally so what i'm looking at here uh is basically this 3d rotating image of the melody trophy almost how are they making i mean this looks awesome like the resolution's amazing everything about like the way it looks is cool how are they making that i think it's just 3d animators on the internet they get them to make some custom stuff for them and by the way those that's a group of people who've had a renaissance right now because there's a whole bunch of famous people that want their own nft and to do that you need a digital artist to make you your cool thing so anyways one cool thing about this by the way you buy the thing and it comes with access so like let me just read off the perks if you bought like the most expensive one so so the gold the gold lamella one is the rookie of the year one it is guaranteed to evolve if he wins rookie of the year which by the way he will this year it comes with a it comes with a physical card it comes with 75 750 and guaranteed endorsement deal rewards so basically his endorsers have to give you free stuff which is kind of cool um it comes with some official merchandise from him you can you have a chance to win nba game tickets valued up to five thousand dollars you have a 50 chance to receive autograph memorabilia and you're going to get exclusive access to video calls that he's going to do with holders of his his collectible so it's kind of cool right what if a basketball card came with access to the player right like you know you buy the lebron card and lebron for all the holders of the of the platinum card he's going to do a skype call with them or why the hell did i say skype a zoom call with them you know once a year or something like that or you get you know a pair of game worn shoes you have a 10 chance of getting those or something like that this is great i think this is so cool what i want to ask well i'll ask that in a second but uh this is awesome i think like i'm not that's like the guy who made this i think he's like 20 21 years old he's like a steve bartlett type of i'm seeing shades of steve bartlett again in this guy who who's a hustler who made this happen so that's actually what i want to ask about i wasn't going to skip ahead but i i do we'll come back to this so what i'm seeing on this website is that this is basically this lamello thing is basically a creation of a company called ethercards is that right uh yeah maybe that's the name of his company yeah yeah his company is called ethercards i'm looking at the traffic if you go to similar web and look at the traffic basically nothing nothing nothing and then in one month three million visitors all the traffic is direct meaning someone very likely is there's just three million people in the very first month of this thing being launched in march typing in ether dot cards uh those numbers if you don't know anything about these numbers that's a really that's phenomenal what i want to know is how are people discovering these types of things so beautiful question i should have said this at the beginning the change here is not oh we went from a a basketball card that's a piece of cardboard that you buy from target um to now a digital thing that you have on on your on your phone or on your computer it's not just that lamello owns his own ip he is releasing his own card set so otherwise the nba signs an agreement with panini they're the guys who make the the all the the basketball cards or tops right these these brands that make cards and the players don't get directly ascent from their their own cards popularity so right now like luka doncic he has the most popular panini cards and they're going up they're being sold on the secondary market for thousands and thousands of dollars you know like a lebron card will sell for for two hundred thousand dollars but lebron doesn't get a cut of that transaction because he didn't issue it he you know he as a collective group they signed the rights you know when they become an nba player the nba cuts a deal and so they're gonna sure they get some like shared royalty stream of like you know whatever the licensing agreement was nba wide but the individual player doesn't get anything and therefore also has no incentive to promote this thing whereas with this lamelo has minted his own card he owns whatever percent he negotiated with ether cards and lamella is going to be putting this in his instagram story all the time and he guess what he's got millions of followers on instagram who love lamella ball and so he's going to get more value out of this than he would ever get out of a traditional basketball basketball card walk me through how this young guy made ether cards and in this business so basically ethercards he just you know he made the website it's it's very slick very cool how is the the tracking of of all these cards possible the the back-end technology of like tracking the payment and all that do they actually make it make that are they building on top of something else i don't know i think they're probably building on top of something else that's one of the best parts of crypto is that because crypto is open source crypto is about building protocols um you can use those protocols to do anything so we had fur con on here uh i don't know did he talk about pac protocol um i don't know if you remember he's building furkan's building something called the pack protocol out of his uh thing uh nft yeah and basically it's just a protocol where you or i can go on there and say hey you know just like you said you love to watch people doing pack breaks of nba cards we could make our own mfm packs just like jack butcher i think did with visualize value we could say great we want we want to uh we're going to offer these 10 possible cards right inside one of them gives you like an hour of business coaching another gives you a shout out on the podcast another gives you a free shirt another gives you just a twitter follow whatever we come up with our rewards we just type them in and it basically says assign the probability to each it's like oh you know the follow is high probability and a hour of business coaching is only one percent of people should get this when they open a pack we set the price and it'll basically spin up like shopify for nfts it'll spin up a website where we can sell our packs and fans can come they could buy them and they can open them up and they can have a chance of winning x inside we didn't have to do any coding to make that happen because they have built the pac protocol into it to make this happen and it's all saved on the ethereum blockchain uh like it's all the ownership is there and so and they just take a cut of every buy um in exchange for having built this technology for us so and back and back to the ether cards so so so these kids like built just the front end and used someone else's protocol and then they hollered at they somehow got in touch with lamello i mean like hey do you agree by the way sorry just to catch up one second they i don't know how we got touched the lumbello i'm going to ask him but uh after launching this project uh so this thing did hundreds of thousands of dollars in the first day when it dropped um so you know just the lamellae thing or the thing did did uh uh i don't know if i could say the exact number but north of three hundred thousand dollars in during the drop um and then uh other players by the way it's so funny saying like north of 300 like yeah it did over 300 433 thousand dollars like that's like you know you got to give people the information without giving people these i'll give you a hint it rides with 700 000 like that's like what you're saying yeah basically so uh other nba players including one of the most popular players on the planet hit him up and was like hey saw the lamellae thing let's like talk to my people let's do it let's do my own and did this kid have a following already on twitter or what platforms are using so he uh i'm gonna chat with him this week but ben talked to him while we were in miami and uh and what he said was that he got big his his claim to fame before this was helping artists go viral on tick tock so he partnered with a bunch of musicians he's like yo you know a bunch of the viral things you've seen on tick tock i kind of architected those behind the scenes i don't know what that means but i'm like oh you got hustler dripping off you like this is good and did you how did ben so ben if you're listening is uh sean's co-worker basically they scheme together how did ben find this bet we saw the announcement on the espn announced lamela ball is doing his own nft we saw an article i go i read the dynamic nft part how it updates based on the player's actual achievements in the real world and i go i just best event i go this is [ __ ] genius find the genius who made this and he went and he found the guy who made it he scheduled a call i couldn't make that call ben ben did the call and uh ben gave me the lowdown on like who this guy is he's like he's awesome you should talk to him and ben met him on social media yeah just dm ben has my i don't know if you use his twitter or he has access to my twitter where you can just dm anybody from my account and uh because my account has more followers i get a higher rate of reply so let's do there's so many takeaways here for a listener i want to actually want to go through these takeaways the first is like i'm actually amazed at this the way that you found this was not special correct maybe if ben used so ben doesn't have a big following right he's just no it looks normal bmw ben levy or ben emily i don't know his twitter something like that ben and levy so yours looks special you have 144 000 people um most people would reply to someone they have 144 000 people but ben does it all he did was dm'd him does the kid even know does he know who you are like does he know sean is like a popular podcaster or anything no idea okay great so that's the takeaway here is that like you found an opportunity by seeing it on espn you had ben but you didn't have to have ben no i i've done this myself that's how i found ben by the way same thing that's a huge takeaway here the other takeaway is just that the setup tea thing is cool yeah yeah yeah exactly and i think you're going to see more of this you're going to see famous people launching their own limited edition nfts that come with access to the person and they own the whole thing so they're not using they don't have to sign with a label or sign with uh or like rely on tops to go make their card for them they're gonna release their own cards and they're gonna own their own upside which is obviously a much better thing for the talent yeah this is amazing i love this i have a couple other topics if you want to go go go go um okay let's do let's do two things how do you how do so normally when we when we research we have a document what are you using reminds us on my notes on my my my it's from my phone's notes because i was just typing it while we were like we'd be out we'd meet somebody like for example at the event where we did the podcast some guy came up he's like hey i'm a lawyer i um i've been a lawyer in dallas for a long time i drove down for the event drove from dallas to austin and uh you know i just love you guys always get the wheels turning in fact i can't just like be a normal lawyer anymore i really want to do more and he has this idea for litigation finance he goes you know what that means did you talk to this guy no but can i guess what that means yeah please basically uh i think this is what peter thiel did uh so is it win okay so basically peter thiel is this billionaire guy who had a vendetta against gawker because gawker outed him as being gay so peter kill is a powerful vc he's gay he didn't want anyone to know he's gay gawker wrote an article saying he's gay and so he plotted for 10 15 years probably 10 years he goes whenever i see these guys slip i'm pouncing so 10 years later after this article hulk hogan uh has a sex tape issue and peter thiel has two guys on staff just sniffing out an infraction they go hey this hulk hogan thing that's it so the story is hulk hogan was uh either some hawk hogan was having sex with someone uh they uh some third party uh filmed it without his consent gawker published the video peter two goes boom that's it hey hawk i got the best lawyers i'm gonna fund you and if the case wins just give me a little cut of it peter thiel probably didn't even take a cut of it right that's how it could have worked how could it work exactly and he did he they did the lawsuit they bankrupt they basically put gawker out of business gucker no longer is is in business the guy who built that site over the years you know it all came falling down because he pushed it too far he pissed off the wrong the wrong billionaire so and by the way some people think this is bad whatever i don't care um so what looks like not that you don't care that if it is or is not bad you're saying it's interesting regardless i'm saying irrelevant to what we're talking about as well whether billionaires should fund lawsuits and take down media or not okay whatever so yeah so litigation finance is exactly this so basically what he does is they uh he's a lawyer he analyzes cases that could be pursued so oh you might have a lawsuit here that you should be pursuing you for whatever reason maybe you don't know if you could win you don't realize it's a it's a you could potentially sue for for being wronged you don't have the money the you know the corporation can can throw all their lawyers at this and you you don't want to go broke trying to trying to just sue um so you kind of sit on it so i think it was like 70 plus a potential suits go um unfiled because of you know one of many reasons and so the idea here would be if you see you can submit to them hey would you back my my case and they basically underwrite the risk of it they look at it they say oh i think you have a really strong case or no i think you have a weak case if you have a strong case they'll say great we will fund the lawsuit you get a piece of it if it works if it doesn't work you lose nothing and uh and so basically the guy had rate has now raised or is raising uh millions and millions of dollars from family offices and other folks to fund these cases and so that's what they're doing now is a thing anyways i thought it was a cool listener idea i don't know what you think of that how much have they raised how much has he raised i think they raised something like six million dollars so far to um to fund this and he's trying to get you know basically as a proof of concept if they could show that yes we are successfully able to underwrite these cases meaning we can correctly select the winners and offer a payback great if once we know that we're able to pay you back 25 30 on your you know annually on your on your on your financing here then we can go raise 50 or 100 or 200 million to do more okay i i've heard of this i didn't realize this was such a thing i am so in so there's a company called burford capital it's uh founded in 2009 located in england did you see it he told me about it he goes this is big in england there's a multi-billion dollar company burford blah blah blah i just googled this while you're talking i googled finance legal stuff the first web the first website went to pravardi capital the website has like uh like a like a monday night football looking guy wearing a white dude wearing an ill-fitting suit right there i'm like opportunity okay like anytime there's like these like shitty wix websites with like basic looking white dudes i'm like that's interesting second the second thing that came up was burford capital i just googled it has a market cap of 1.8 billion dollars started in 2009 that's pretty good right that's pretty this is pretty amazing exactly so he was like you know i'll send you the information uh and i told him i said look this sounds great uh i don't know anything about this so i'm probably not gonna fund it just because i have two options i can either invest in things i really understand or like invest in things i don't understand i used to do both but now that this podcast has gotten so popular now the number of opportunities that i do understand are so large they they exceed my investable capital now i don't have to do [ __ ] i don't understand anymore this is a really interesting business this is but was so when i you're further along and i would actually say you're probably a better investor than i am when i look at these types of companies i think like what's the idea that's important right i think of i don't have enough time to go and verify if this is like a solid market so i look at who else is investing right that's probably a lot of people say oh that's boring you know are you ever going to take a chance well probably not to be honest like i like looking at that but then the third thing is i look at the person are they a competent person right um like so does this person seem like they're going to build a huge company off this uh you know he seemed like a competent person he seemed like a lawyer who you know it's i don't think you need to be the visionary or like the shark executor i don't think you need to do anything for that i think you literally just need to be um somebody who's going to do the blocking and tackling to make this happen i don't think it requires genius which is great that's actually a positive thing for for this business you don't want to invest in businesses that require genius yes but you more likely than not need some type of charisma uh in order to be i mean like you either do need to be a genius so you do need to be like a peter thiel type of guy you do need to be maybe like a water like you or me type of person which we don't really know how to do that much but we're charismatic enough to convince other people to come work at our companies and convince them to do the work yeah um like and then you have like a few like industry knowledge what maybe this guy has something you need attributes as conor mcgregor once said if you're gonna be you're gonna have some attributes yeah if you're gonna beat me you need some attributes yeah so like look if you're gonna like succeed you need that you need some attributes so what are the attributes gonna be like something like when you're building a fighter or building a sports team or building like a nba player on video games and you can like put like do i make this person like as fast as possible do i make them as tall as possible do i make them as strong as possible you need something there i think that's the next shirt you need attributes to beat me yeah so like what attributes does this guy have so that's what i'm curious about yeah i think his domain knowledge i think that's the biggest do you agree with me by the way you need some attributes you do and what i guess like the only point i was trying to make is that some require more attributes than other there are some where you have to be the smartest and the fiercest and fastest and you know like that's there's some businesses that require that and there's some where you can be the tortoise not the hare right and i think this is one where you could be the tortoise you just have to keep going forward and that's an attribute by the way determination and just i'm willing to do it all the time exactly and uh you know having the steady hand and being um being good at actually selecting the cases right because that's going to just prove the track record out over time so i think the domain knowledge matters all right i wanted to do some other topics so i have like three but i don't know which one i want to do okay i'll give you i'll give you some options this is amazing by the way this is turning out to be quite good all right totally unplanned so and by the way i wrote these down just while we were talking about the beginning when the guy canceled all right so bitcoin miami i have a few um comments on what was going on in bitcoin miami i don't know i heard it was horrible so we could talk about that we could talk about um i have a thing on secondhand ecommerce if you want to hear that um also door-to-door sales i have a story there and the last one is a framework about the next apple the next google the next facebook so so tell me they're all great give me which one you want to do uh the second one and then the fourth one okay the second one i think was uh the secondhand ecommerce thing yeah all right so let's do that so um so as you know i've been dabbling in e-commerce and you know building up built a brand and then have gotten built a community called club ltv that has like i don't know 100 store owners each doing somewhere between 1 million a year and 100 million a year in sales and so in that i've started to learn some of the problems the pain points of e-commerce one of the interesting things that i didn't know about that you might know about right because you've used poshmark i think when i was at your house you told me guess what me and sarah did this weekend we sold like 97 worth of old clothes on poshmark and i was like dude what's happening this is your hobby and you're like yeah i love this [ __ ] um i didn't realize how big this second-hand market for for e-commerce e-commerce's dude it's crazy so let me tell you poshmark uh going public multi-billion dollar evaluation is a public party yeah what what is it uh i don't know we'll look it up but yeah it's a public okay there's thread up spoken hustle count raised 250 million dollars either going public or went public already uh there's grail i discovered grail in 2011 i didn't have any money it was launched uh first marks 3.6 billion great there's grail i i dm'd this guy because or i messaged him on reddit years ago because i was on the day he launched it i was going to the website i didn't invest in it i think it still could be great it's basically poshmark for hip dudes what else is there i mean there's like eight others yeah let me tell you what i think is interesting here we for our store for our our d2c brand we have a large amount of people who buy new and they they're willing to spend more buying new because they know there's this has secondary value they know they could sell it three months from now six months from now either new or used and recoup a good amount of the money so uh certain certain categories you can do that better than others so anyways the uh but but managing this thing is is really awful so the way that people do it today is sometimes they list on poshmark or the real real or um like uh i forgot the other one makari mercari's huge um they go they go list on those exchanges but a big part of it is they have facebook groups for every brand so every brand will have any brand with with a cult following will have a secondary market facebook group called buy sell trade bst and we b st bst so you can look up any brand name on facebook go type in the brand name and like i don't know your favorite boots or leather jackets you liked or whatever just type in that bst so what you'll see is that there are these these private groups on facebook communities for buying selling and trading what you already have what you do is you take a photo of your your closet or your item you lay it down on the floor you take a photo of it and you just write you know like there's all these acronyms like if you go in there it's another language it's like mwt that means new with tag okay great uh or like you know iso in search of this product and so they have their own little lingo it's this insider community and you post the item you just say here's what i have here's what it's for i have no pets in the house no smokers and then somebody in the comments will just say uh they'll just type in a number it's like an uh a little auction that would be like 40 and then you just say done send me your what's your email i'll send you the paypal invoice so there's this like it's like this kind of like stitched together experience where then you have to send them the paypal invoice they have to pay it um then you have to like find their get their mailing address you have to ship it and then dude i just googled bst i just found one paintball bst 20k members right and that's what they'll have they'll have tens of thousands of members often and they're very active and for the brand for the brand themselves this becomes kind of a headache if it's good but it's bad why is it bad so the first thing is a bunch of people will buy your product just to flip it right so they'll go and they'll sell it for more so we have a product we have one one of our products uh it sells for 65 and then immediately so it sells out the first minute we release it and then it immediately starts selling for 10 times more so 500 or 600 dollars on mercari or the second-hand websites what's the uh what what's that mercari one m-e-r-c-a-r-i you've probably seen their billboards before um they're very good that's cool so um so anyways so so some one one part pain point is is these flippers but that's okay uh the other part is like you don't benefit from the secondhand market directly like you don't get any cut of those sales that are happening but uh you do sometimes have customer service problems because people complain oh you know i bought this thing from the official buy sell trade group and they scammed me or they didn't send it or they sent the wrong item and you're like dude this is not my problem like this is that's not even us that's like craigslist so like so you can't complain to us about what's going on on craigslist so this company we found um has a very interesting take on this so i'm trying to invest in this it's called tread how did you find this how do you find all this crap guess who i can can i how do i share him you need a you want to give a love letter to ben i think you fell in love with ben on this trip i did um tread is uh tread.com so sean has this guy who he pays a great salary to and his name's ben and i hung out with ben for the first time and what ben i admire him so much ben is and i say this with love pretty nerdy a nerdy guy and not like in terms of like looks or acts but like just like his interests like he just loves like gadgets he loves um new stuff and i started talking about him and he just brought or talking to him and he just told me he just browses the web to find the latest and greatest stuff and he'll use it and then he'll dm or email or message the person who starts the thing and just say this is neat here's tips that i would do to make it better or here's been my experience using your thing and that's all he says and in doing that he sees everything and knows everyone and i think it's so fascinating right he's just uh he's just helpful okay it's not it's not trend treat is the name of it treat.kelly i'll send it to you t-r-e-e-t dot co um okay so check that out so what they do is they have this idea of circular commerce meaning you make an item you sell it and then that person instead of it just going to waste um they can resell it to the next person and they can resell it to the next person it's sort of a circular uh commerce model so what do they do say the url again t-r-e-e-t treat dot co so what they do is they give your shopify store a page or a tab that just creates the second-hand market right there in your store so somebody who wants to buy a used item can just go buy it secondhand whip from within your store um you don't have to do the whole paypal invoicing facebook group you know questionable integrity type of thing anymore uh customers can just list their stuff here it can be bought from from your store which has more trust than just a random group and the transaction is processed you know online using normal credit card processing and stuff on this and the brand gets a percent cut you can set your percent cut of what you'll take out for hosting the second-hand market so it's an additional new revenue stream for a ddc brand i think this is really really smart this does two things a it legitimizes the sort of secondary circular nature of it and a lot of people like that that it's not being that's like a less wasteful version of consumerism the second thing is that it takes resale and it makes it a part of your business model as the brand so for consumers it helps because it's higher trust you know the technology is all built you don't have to do this manually through facebook groups and for the brand here's an extra x percent of revenue that you're going to make every month because now you participate in the resale market that's crazy um i i don't know if this is a good idea um how would you feel as a business i mean you you do i'm gonna use this because i want this for our business do you think a lot of people feel the same way i don't know we'll see you know what my gut says super early make more [ __ ] like why are you selling out don't sell out like is you selling out that sounds like a you problem not a you need a plug-in problem well it's not just not just for selling out right some people just can't afford the full priced item like i don't know you bought those dumbbells in your in your garage second hand off facebook marketplace or whatever right like if you can get the good the item in good condition for half the price uh for a lot that opens up your buyer pool into a different segment that can't maybe always afford the full price item and you don't have to do heavy discounting as a brand okay so i'm just googling as you're talking because we didn't have time to research but uh so patagonia's ceo has this great thing where he goes i actually don't want you to uh buy more stuff buy one thing from us and if you if it rips if it rips we'll fix it and um it should just last so like only buy one thing so i just googled patagonia pre-owned they have a url that's dedicated to it called onewhere.patagonia.com and i'm pretty sure they have their entire yeah they have an entire way to buy and sell uh their own their own gear kind of cool actually it is actually cool you know who would buy use patagonia stuff me me i buy used clothing all the time whenever i buy red wing boots i always buy amused i actually changed my opinion very quickly i think this is cool all right i'm glad patagonia got you across the line okay i have another uh topic for you do you want to do another one or yeah keep going wrap it up no keep going this is good okay let's do one more no no you you had four things where you were at 40. which one you want to do so your remaining options open the door door-to-door okay so this is a little bit longer patagonia's pre-owned website by the way it's [ __ ] sick 90 jeans for 38 bucks on board but could treat be a big business uh as a shopify plug-in am i being a hater just because it's a simple shopify plug-in well i don't even it's not i don't even think it is a shopify plug-in but i know what you mean uh yeah i think it's i think it's the wrong way to think about it because if you look at how big the centralized marketplaces are mercari poshmark those are three or four billion this is that same thing but just decentralized instead of one website where you go to find all the brands every brand has your little marketplace embedded into it so i think it's a smart strategy where you you give the brand the marketplace instead of trying to get the customer to come to your app this is [ __ ] awesome some more here's some more so door-to-door sales so this thing has been happening recently and i know you love the mormons so i think you'll you'll dig this love the mormons i love the mormons so i have met in the la or i've heard these stories in the last few days i'll give you two of door-to-door sales i have never done door-to-door sales but i'm almost jealous that i haven't now so i'll give you two words two examples do you know who brian johnson is janae might might not be might be hard to place yeah so i know two different brian johnsons one sells books online and the other started braintree braintree is the guy i'm talking about okay that's that's pretty good you know you get you get 200 points uh for your house there all right so so brian johnson i was listening to his interview he went on um lex friedman's podcast i was listening to it does he still work uh yeah so so his story is insane so he basically creates braintree which is like a payments uh it's basically a online payments company stripe before strike it was straight before stripe it didn't become stripe but it sold for about 800 800 million dollars i believe to paypal and he owned most all of it uh yeah exactly he owned a huge chunk of it he also i think they bought venmo along the way uh so so he had this strategy early on which was like we go to the merchants we get the merchants to use this because we're so easy to use online and then we'll build a consumer uh like side of the we'll buy the most hit consumer app and that was venmo and that would be a valuable company and anyway so he builds his company for 800 million dollars he sells it and he decides what he wanted was he wanted to have a huge nest egg to just reinvest into a world-changing idea so he's like how do i get as much financial capital as possible in the next few years so that i can self-fund and work on one of the most like gnarly you know like few life world-changing problems so the thing he's working on and by the way he thought that braintree wasn't gonna be i mean that's like pretty and lex even brings this up he's like you know online payments actually does help the world he's like yeah that's true but i knew that if i didn't do online payment somebody else would i wanted to work on something that if i didn't do it i don't know if anyone else would and so the thing he's working on is that same thing that um that elon is working on uh neural link so his is called kernel kernel it's a it's a brain interface so so what that means is you put this like helmet on it looks like a bicycle helmet and it's basically reading your brain waves while you're sitting there and so you know what does that mean first it can analyze your brain while you're just doing things so that's interesting you can get more insight about yourself um and there here's what his company's trying to do is basically spit the data out so that all he's trying to do is be able to read brain data then any developer can take that those that data and those learnings and actually build any application to improve your life off of it um so that's what they're trying to build with colonel so and by the way he took i think 60 million dollars after he sold braintree and he funded the first 60 million into colonel himself because yeah reading about that right now he put uh so they've raised um 53 from outside 54 from his own money yeah 5450 for a million of his own money exactly and so i think you know most investors didn't want to touch it because it's like dude this is just going to be a money pit uh you know it's the hardest technology requires the most expensive engineers we're not there yet it's going to take 10 years and he's like yeah don't worry that's why i that's why i have this nest egg uh to to fund this thing myself how much did he make when he sold um braintree you think i don't know i don't know the exact number um but anyways this doesn't even matter this is just set up those that's the guy cool guy yeah i would have featured him maybe as billy of the week and maybe we'll do a little bit of a deeper job hey dan let's get this guy on the podcast this guy's cool yeah we'll get brian on the part i thought was pretty remarkable is his door-to-door sales part okay so what happened so before he starts braintree he um i think he had done a startup and it was fail it either had failed or it was failing and what he did was uh i hope i don't butcher this story i'm just trying to remember this off top my head uh because we didn't have time to prep today so what he did was he needed some money so he he's like okay how do i get money fast i have my startups failing or i'd already failed uh he's like okay i need like a sales job so he goes and he gets a sales job with a um some kind of like financial product company i think it was like either like uh credit cards or something like that for for for businesses and so he's like he's basically a sales rep and he's like okay how do i um how do i become like the best sales rep for this and so it became a door-to-door sales challenge and so he was going door to door to each merchant and he was selling them on the benefits of this product and and he would then get a commission off of like kind of the whatever the value of that customer was over the the next period of time and um and so i oh my god i'm going to butcher this because i can't remember the hack he used but he had a he had a very clever technique he was using when he was going door to door would that enabled him to become the top salesman in north america and so i'm gonna go right in brian did yeah so he became the number one sales person he basically goes door-to-door and he figures out how to sell this product and what he said was like door-to-door sales is like just this um like really formative formative experience for anybody because you have to have like an incredible amount of determination you're going to get rejected all the time and you need to learn how to like get your foot in the door how to get somebody's attention how to get them interested and how to close them in order to sell any product door-to-door and then i so so i heard the story from brian johnson and he talked about how important that experience was to him next day i go meet my uncle i have an uncle who i've talked about on the pod before because i consider him to be the happiest man on earth uh he's a real estate uncle a real estate uncle his name's uncle vinnie literally people uh just coined his name smiley uh so they just stopped calling him vinnie people just call him smiley because he's just so smiley like his company they got him a trophy because he's the number one sales person and on the trophy they didn't put his name they just wrote smiley and that became kind of like the nickname that stuck and they didn't even ask his permission they just knew this is the right name for this guy so he's incredibly happy but he's also been incredibly successful and i would say i don't think he's in all of my my aunts my uncles in terms of iq just raw intelligence i don't know he's probably either 50 percentile maybe even less maybe maybe half maybe half him sorry vinny no and i mean this with love because uh whatever the point i'm making is good thing they didn't call him dopey smells a lot better he's he's the most successful of anyone in our family but it's not because he had more raw horsepower in the brain that's not the reason that that he was able to do it and uh so i was telling my trainer about him and he goes i'd love to meet him and i go what he goes yeah does he where does he live i go he lives in danville actually lives you know not far away from here you know 30 minute drive he goes could we just go meet him i was like yeah so i texted my uncle i said hey i was telling my trainer about you and he just he wants to meet you and he goes he was like sure come on bye no problem yes like can't wait to see you uh and i was like i was like who doesn't and i was like i noted to myself he didn't even ask why what's the context you want something from me he's just like yes uh you wanna you wanna meet me yes and i also thought to myself what what a goal by the way to be the type of person that people wanna make a pilgrimage out you know to go drive an hour to go see um just just because of a description of the way you are i thought that's kind of amazing because he doesn't want anything from him he's not trying to get a business deal or get a customer out of him he just heard how his personality is and i was like i gotta meet this guy so we go we drive out there and we sit down and uh you know he's already on level 10 excitement and we're having a great time and i started asking him i said you know when did you become you where did you become this way you weren't born this way so how did you become this way and he was telling me the long story and he talked about this door-to-door sales job he goes i came from india and i'm a student at university he goes uh george washington university i think he goes i needed a summer job i needed he's like i came here i only had enough tuition the government paid for my tuition for the first year i had no idea how i was gonna pay for the second year but like i have one summer to bridge that gap like how the heck am i gonna make next fall's tuition so he looked for a job and his roommate was like hey i worked for this company that called southwestern i don't know if you ever heard of this company you're gonna love it but basically this company called southwestern and what they do is they sell books so they sell books door-to-door they have this fleet of college students that will go out and they'll sell these books like encyclopedias um dictionaries bibles um um you know any textbooks of any kind and southwestern advantage is what it's called and so and they've they've since grown like crazy they acquired all now it's like 20 something companies and it's like a multi-billion dollar company crazy story about the founder i'm going to have him as the billy of the week as a special profile but i want to tell this door-to-door sales story so he goes okay great so what do i do he's like you know i can barely speak english because i'm just here from india but okay i gotta go do door-to-door sales how do i do that he's like they gave this this training where um you they give us seven books like you know how to win friends and influence people you know uh you know like these seven kind of classic self-help books tony robbins and whatever he's like read these seven books and then come to this training seminar he goes i go to this thing it's an auditorium and it's me and like you know the 50 other college students and there's this stage and there's just a door frame on the stage and you'd have to get up and you'd have to knock on the door and then they would have an act you know like the person from the company on the other side an actor who is like i'm mrs johnson and you you open the door mrs johnson and she would simulate like slamming the door on your face and being like like stop bothering us right or somebody who's like lukewarm or somebody who's interested and they would teach you how to sell door-to-door and he talked he talked to me he's like i used to they used to dr uh but my job basically every day in the summer and i'm in the you know the heat of summer i would my roommate would drive me to some neighborhood any neighborhood i would just pick a different one every day and at 9am he would drop me off i didn't own a car so i needed him to pick me up at the end of the day so he's like 9am he'd drop me off in a neighborhood and 9pm he'd come pick me up at the end of the day and he's like i would go door to door and i'd knock and they would teach you the skills of selling door-to-door so do you know i don't know if you have you ever heard this i was fascinated by how you act what is the actual method of selling when you're door-to-door have you ever heard this um no well so you typically say hey i was just talking to a bunch of your neighbors and they thought this was interesting and so here i am talking to you that that's definitely part of it but he broke it down step he's like there's a scientist that they taught us at this training he goes first you ring the doorbell you knock on the door and you don't look into the door because when you look at the door it's a little bit intimidating um and they see your face they recognize that they don't know you um he's like you want to look slightly you know off 45 degree angle away so that they're gonna like when they look through the peephole they're gonna be like okay i don't know who this guy is but it doesn't look too threatening and then what are they trying to get you to do like to step your foot into the door eventually basically so you they open the door and you you explain the pitch that you just said which is you know hi my name is my name is vinnie and um i'm a student here at george washington nearby um and i actually have been uh you know i've been talking to your neighbors uh we what we do is we sell uh you know we sell tech or whatever it is he's basically saying i was talking to your neighbors and i wanted to stop by your place i'm a student nearby right so you you become a local you're not a stranger you're a friend right so you you you imagine you want to put like a time stamp like there's only going to be i'm i actually i have to go in a second yeah exactly i don't have a bunch of time but i would love to just you know chat with you whatever right and he goes he goes uh a lot of people what they would try to do is the door sample meaning they would tell them i'm here to sell you a textbook check out this book is this something you're interested in and then you know the learning is nobody ever buys a book at the door and i thought that's actually like a very applicable thing for almost every kind of sale is you're because you're afraid of getting rejected you rush you rush to try to just sample it you know give them give them the value so you don't annoy them but the reality is that that's not how a product like this would ever be bought nobody's ever going to buy this at the door itself so he goes you want to get into the home the whole objective of the door is to get into the home and it reminded me of your writing style where you go i was about to say this this is why i always say longer is better i want them to fall down my slippery slope and explain the slippery slope it's like the first line the goal of the first right look there's only one goal of a headline of a sales page and that's to get you to read the sub headline the only goal the sub headline is to get you read the first sentence and the only goal the first sentence is to get you read the second sentence i'm going to keep on doing that until you fall down the slippery slope and not only a lot of people say i want to make this very easy to read so do i i want to make it easy to read as well but i'm going to tell you a story and i'm not going to rush it and i want you to fall slowly fall down the slippery slope and i want to make it kind of hard for you because the more pot committed you are the more likely you are to buy exactly exactly so this is the same exact thing so he wanted to get into the home so he goes you asked to come in and um and you you don't you don't look them in the face you sort of lead with your arm and your face you sort of like point where you're trying to go like into their living room right behind them so you say you know would you mind if i come in for a moment and you you sort of point your way into the door and uh if you're once you're in the door now your close rate has gone from like 0.01 to like 30 or 40 percent just because you're there you're sitting and you're sitting down so you're not like standing anymore it's not by the way this is why on all my landing pages i always ask for email first because once you give me your email you're just a little bit more bought in you're in the door exactly and you know they might offer you a water or a drink you say yes you don't say no now you're both sitting there you have your water and you start to explain to them and now you need to put it in the context of their problem so you look around the house oh i see you have children how old are they oh i got a boy and girl myself uh yeah you know blah blah blah this this age is the craziest blah blah blah what are your kids doing for what do you do for a kind of after school education for your children and that's how you're leading into the encyclopedia sale that's how you're leading into the textbook sale is you need to frame your your product as a solution to their problem right so this is all like you know this is common sense but i just loved it yeah common dog uh i think that like a lot of people don't know this i think you want you so i learned it so i read how to win friends and influence people by the way all those old like uh fuzzy books like how to win friends and people influence people they can grow rich it sounds silly i endorse all of them fully that [ __ ] totally helps you tony robbins totally helps you i'm i'm entirely on board with that right the founder of panda express makes all of his employees go through a tony robbins and how to influence people uh seminar totally on board with it um it's that i learned how to do this when i was selling hot dogs and then you know what else i did like every other 18 year old i i use it to meet girls right and it totally worked and i mastered that well i wasn't like that good but like for i i stepped up my game from uh significantly when i learned how to do all this right right exactly and so he told me a couple things out of that he goes um he's like here i am i'm a hindu selling bibles to to bear i mean indian hindus selling bibles to americans and he's like that experience that whole summer he's like you know i it changed me he's like first i'm working hard i'm there at 9 am i'm walking around carrying loads and loads of books and i'm walking door to door and i'm getting mostly rejected uh but then you know if i get even an inch she's like i used to schedule a same-day follow-up he's like so oh now's not a good time you know would it be better this evening when your husband's home like maybe 5 p.m great i'll be back because he's like i'm just walking around the neighborhood anyways i'll walk right back to this he's like so i was scheduling same-day follow-ups to keep the keep the ladies like by the second time they met me now i'm not a stranger he's like nothing has changed they don't know anything more about me but it's just the second time they've seen me and um and so there was all these little things i thought were really applicable to sales but also i started thinking about these formative experiences the really hard experiences uh like what's a hard business experience and i think this is actually pretty underrated so he said learn to work hard i learned how to sell i learned how to build rapport and talk to people and he's like i wasn't doing it to manipulate anybody he's like i just genuinely would life was a lot more fun if i got to know the person rather than you know having a standoff relationship and then them being angry that i'm bothering them that day and it got to the point where one woman would be like are you walking around carrying all these books he's like well yeah you know i have to uh and she's like here's the keys to my car here's my van drive my van around the neighborhood instead so she gave him this car to actually do the sale so it went from most people slam the door on a door to a salesman she gave him his her car to make it easier for him to go do what he was doing he still keeps in touch with her 36 years later or something like that 40 years later he's like yeah you know she just sent me this cake and like mrs whatever her name was he's like we're still good friends actually because and we met because i sold her you know a bible back in the day and um so i thought this was interesting so i think there's something to this and from two levels what are the opportunities here i thought hey um who's doing door-to-door sales now are there still companies that primarily sell door-to-door i'm going to research them and find something yeah i mean like some really they're probably the most famous one is cutco you know cutco no what is that um wow you've never heard of cutco so they make knives in kitchenware their knives are actually pretty good but their whole business model is uh door to door and um like i've got friends that have done it it's reputable in the sense that it's a good product right some people think it's scammy but because they're like direct sales and multi-level marketing but it's legit right and so i'm interested in these direct sales companies i'm also interested in hiring people who are successful door-to-door sales people in fact there was a guy on the podcast early on who did this for solar he's like my first job was door-to-door sales i was selling solar like hey you know have you ever thought about doing solar it lowers your bill and blah blah blah we can help you out it's good for the environment and he's like dude it was hard as [ __ ] but i got good at it i became the top sales person and i kind of feel like i can i will never go wrong if i hire the top salesperson from any door-to-door sales company it's like works hard knows how to sell um like what else do you need when you're when you're trying to hire somebody well you want to hear something funny you know who jordan belford is yeah the wolf of wall street oh we talked about it this weekend i think you haven't read his book you should so jordan belford was the wolf of wall street he made hundreds of millions of dollars selling penny stocks to rich people and he was a great sales person he created this thing called straight line persuasion he started by selling fish and steaks door-to-door [Laughter] that's how his entire thing started was door-to-door yeah it's a great book but it was all it's all door-to-door sales yeah so i don't really have i don't really know what the point of this is it's more like i loved hearing these stories i i'm sort of jealous i never had this experience because i think i would be better at what i do if i did um and i want to go further i want to research these companies and i want to start hiring people out of this pool of talent i think it is an underrated pool of talent just like we talked about you know sort of mormons who go on the mission and they have to sell sort of the hardest thing sell a religion to somebody who never asked you to come sell it to them and they have to do that for two years that does create a certain sales ethic and work ethic in a person and uh we've seen that take place that's why almost all the direct sales companies all the uh the successful direct sales companies are all based out of utah um because that's where the talent is that knows how to do this sort of thing i think for i would say for not preparing this episode turned out to be pretty amazing and i would say even amongst all episodes this has been one of my favorite dan do you agree that this has been fire this has been great guys door-to-door sales was awesome what about the other stuff the other stuff was good too you guys just finished with a big bang yeah um i think this ended up being a winner um so that's the episode i think right we're gonna wrap up there let's rap um tomorrow or wednesday i want to talk about co-working spaces i think we have to have a my first million co-working business yeah you like that idea i do that was another bad idea and i think it's wonderful so i tweeted out who i could talk to i got a bunch of interesting stuff um we're going to talk about that next week wednesday [Music] travel never looking back

it's really effing hard to start a two-sided marketplace and when you do the prize is a billion dollars uh you know in your pocket yeah i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like my days off on the road let's travel never looking back all right what's up uh i was thinking about the beginning of these because um if you watch like joe rogan joe just sort of rolls into the conversation it's actually starts like mid-sentence of what they're already talking about and i think that's kind of cool it's pretty casual and then you have other people that really try to like brand their brand their beginning so i'll give you a couple examples and you tell me which one you think is a good idea so um the all-in podcast which i like is hosted by jason calikanis and then what he does is they have the uh what they call the cold open which we do sometimes too which is you pull kind of like the most interesting or funny one-liner from the middle of the episode you put it at the beginning and then you roll into like the intro song where it introduced kind of it's like a custom song that introduces the four people it's like chamath this black king you know david friedberg the king the queen of quinoa or whatever so that's like one version then there's you know scott adams the guy who started dilbert or writes the dilbert comic he does this thing every time he does a live and he used to do live streams like every day or something like that and he would always say let's start with a ceremonial sip and he would like hold up his drink to the camera he would have you do it too even though you're not even on camera you're just at home he's like everybody let's do this and cheers all right here we go and he's like he talked about it he's like he's big on neuro-linguistic programming nlp and um and so he's hypno he's like a trained hypnotist or something like that and so he's like you want to like associate the same sort of like he's like doing this with my tea is brilliant or your coffee because it has emotion it has a taste it has a smell and it has a auditory thing i'm saying every single time the same exact thing and so i'm basically programming you for a certain feeling or emotion of the life so he's like really you know going hard at it um our buddy pomp does the same thing he's got like his little catch phrase where he starts he's like bang bang everybody he does this little finger thing at the start of every single video um very specifically does the same thing every single time so what do you think about that uh i like the joe rogan one to just roll into it don't try so hard yeah do you agree um i i definitely think the other one's more effective but um but who cares like uh you know i think if you have to try that hard um i think it's fine i guess it's fun to do if it's whatever if you think of something but if nothing comes naturally i def i don't think you should force it because uh it's just more likely like awkward than anything else at that point um and in general i think that like i tweeted this out about twitter bios i don't know if you saw this tweet i did but i said here's the twitter bio paradox and i showed two people side by side uh one was dan gilbert who's been our billy of the week before so like an actual billionaire so i ever this guy's a baller and his his bio makes him try to sound like a regular guy because his his but his twitter buy was like you know family man retired pizza delivery driver you know trying to make an impact on as many people as i can and then it's like at cavs at quicken loans at whatever like these companies like yeah he owns an nba team and like a a 10 to 30 billion dollar company or whatever and then i put it but the other side it just puts up some random guy i had to snipe some some guy it didn't mean nothing personal but i just searched on twitter forbes thundering into 30 to see who would be putting that in their bio because that's the ultimate tell that you're trying too hard because you know we've talked about before it doesn't mean [ __ ] and um i found this guy who was like investor entrepreneur innovator philanthropist exactly forbes 30 under 30 finalists which people were just making fun of him like dude you weren't even 43 you were a finalist you're like one of the top 30 000 people or something um and then it's like you know international speaker renowned you know whatever and then and then mentions like two companies that he's like you know started or whatever and nobody's ever heard of these companies and so i said on one side you have a baller trying to act like like trying to counter signal that he's a regular guy and on the other side you have a regular guy trying to signal that he's a baller and uh you know this is the the paradox of twitter the harder you try the more you tell me that you're still trying and um and you can see this across the board there's you know a lot of people have no bio and the no bio is like my name speaks for itself you either know who i am or i don't care i've achieved so much fame that i'm not trying to impress you so uh i think that's a pretty interesting tell and and i like the the term that somebody pointed out for which was signaling and counter signaling they're actually both signaling the rich guy's trying to signal the rich guy's trying to signal i'm just like you don't mind me don't hate me and then the other guy is trying to say i'm bigger than i am right but both are both are signaling oh you wanna do some questions yeah let's do it all right um i'm gonna ask you a question that people asked us um this is a funny question i don't know if i want to answer this we'll let you do it um oh dan compiled some all right dan but let me ask one first what's it like to be rich [Laughter] yeah it's sweet it's sweet because you don't have to worry about a bunch of things and so yeah it doesn't take away all your worries but it takes away all your money worries so if you've ever like you know boom you get hit with a like my car was in an accident it's like oh [ __ ] i'm gonna have to pay like thousands of dollars to get this repaired if i didn't have money lying around that's a that that can ruin a day real quick they can ruin a week real quick they can ruin a month and so yeah it's sweet to not have to have a certain set of worries um or things that just are downers do you have a number so we what's interesting is that you know there's this idea of having a number of like i'm ready to retire and like a lot of studies have been done and very like interestingly a lot of people will have a number that they're at and then if you double it that's what they like on average people say look so if you have five million dollars like uh if i had ten i'd be happy if only i had ten yeah yeah or if i have ten if i had twenty i'd be happy which is always kind of funny it's like three inches in height everybody wants three inches in height right do you did you have a number do you have a number uh yeah i did and then some people who were way past that were like dude that number is not enough uh your number was six i used to say six million uh because i'd done some calculations and i was like oh six six should do it where what i was trying to calculate was if i had six that was uh like working for me six million invested i was saying okay with x you know average annual return does that cover my life burn even if my life burn was twice what it is today and and people were like yeah but uh you know that rate of return is a little bit like too optimistic and your life burn is going to go up more you just haven't really figured that out yet yeah you know the more money you have the higher your life burn's gonna go it's hard to really be disciplined about that so do you have a number now yeah so now i think the number is um i don't know i think 20 is the number where i would now have to like think of different ways that like why money matters um why why more money would matter to me um like all the obvious things would be more than taken care of at 20 million so what's funny is i've talked about this with uh as well and the people at 20 say the same thing 40 maybe a 40. maybe at 40. so i don't know when that when that stopped because i used to take one and then i used to think six and then once you get there you're like okay you're at six well no six this is i'm not i can't stop here right 20. maybe at 20 and then maybe at 20 i'll do the same thing what do you think it is um so i think it definitely is like um yeah 15 to 20 like if you have 15 20 million dollars at a really young age like you know let's say 31 uh like it's you're set it's hard to lose it's hard yeah i could i could lose 10 million and still have 10 million um so like it's hard to lose now you're not flying private but you're living a really nice life and you're never going to work again but here's the thing guys like i don't know about you but guys like me even though i say i'm not going to work anymore i'm always going to work um and because work is play so i have someone who can earn 20 million at a young age i think they're set regardless because they're always going to be able to earn that's a very good point age the age definitely matters because it's all about sort of how many years of compounding are you going to get from there um and i was doing the math basically like at a seven and a half percent return so like if you believe that the trailing hundred years is going to repeat itself for the next hundred years then you can if you believe that that's that's to be true then your money will double around not every nine years so 20 at 30 becomes 40 at uh 40 which becomes 80 at 50 which becomes 160 at 60 and that becomes a billion by the time you're 90 which is kind of wild how about now the question is like well when we're 90 like is a billion even gonna mean you know that much who knows but like that that growth is quite phenomenal and that's really hard to grasp unless you put it in front of you so getting wealthyish at a young age i think is very significant um yes okay so that's fine i don't know i feel like i gave kind of a generic answer which was what's it like to be rich i guess like i didn't what what i'm glad i didn't do was say oh you know it's not as it's not as good as you think uh which a lot of people say a lot of british people will say you know i thought it'd be great but then i realized that what really matters is family it's like yeah dude i know that family matters right i'm asking what the rich part of the experience is like you know how's that how's that been for you and uh and i guess what i would say is like rich whatever rich means to you you know the main the main benefit from my perspective is that there are just certain things you don't have to concern yourself with or work or worry about anymore um you know the biggest being if i don't want to work or i don't want to go to this job i can just not do that i can do something else with my time right like the money has freed up time time can be now invested in any activity you want and that tends to be like you're picking that now you're picking stuff you really enjoy or you think really makes an impact rather than you know something you have to do in order to pay next month's bill andrew asked outside of business this is andrew wilson what do you research and read about i'll go first i read a ton of history i love american history starting in around 1860 going all the way up to about 1950. uh i think that's when crony capitalism kind of came to uh that kind of went away in all the regulations that came into place in america it kind of came to be and a lot of interesting stuff was going on there i also love reading and listening about the mafia because i think what the mafia did is like as american as apple pie like it's so fascinating to me so i read a ton of history and i research a ton a ton of uh or like early american stuff so i'd like to go to museums and and look at old architecture from that era wow we couldn't be more different all right so outside of business i would break it into three groups i study or research what the nerds are into right now so anytime you know smart friends who are kind of like technically minded if they're into something i it takes me probably five times longer than them just to understand that that new technology but uh i put in that time because i like it and um so like you know somebody will mention something that hey you know um this ai thing you know is now able to predict protein folding and i'll be like protein folding i don't know what the [ __ ] proteins fold for what's protein folding all about what have people tried before how do they even get this to work what is actually machine learning how does that work you know like and so i try to i try to basically study what the nerds study that's one two is more of like the unwinding which is sports i'm like knee-deep in basketball you know uh stuff so i like to follow all the storylines stats you know that sort of thing uh and then the last one that i would say is self-help or some kind of like mindset so i think that uh you know people probably at this point if you listen to this podcast you know that um more than anything i'm a believer that if you can master your mind you've won the game and i think that that's the hardest hardest thing to master is your mind and i want to read all the different ways people do that and try them and self-experiment and then go back and research more so that's the third thing i do how did success influence or change the dynamics of your romantic relationships that's a good question but we both have been um from uh julie julie davila yes julie had that was a good question best question so far so i was i met my wife right when i started my company and um before that i dated a ton i i was okay big dog i was i'm not saying it was successful let me change that i tried to date a time yeah uh so i tried to i i liked women um it didn't always work but uh i prefer being in a relationship uh being successful has been cool with my wife because it feel because we are manage our success together and like i think for both of us our wives were successful before we were yeah my wife yeah were at least way more liquid they made they made more money faster than we than we did dude i'll say it i mean my wife was a self-made liquid millionaire before i was right uh yeah i think i think same same is true for me so so that was uh that's the first part like you know how it was really you know how was success for them was the real question i was like working marrying this broke you know broke entrepreneur who keeps trying to say he's living the big dream but you know where's the where's the success for like you know it's five years that that's that's the first question so yeah when i dated sarah her mom was like so does he and her parents are entrepreneurs so they kind of got it but like does he have a job like well no he's trying to start this conference thing or where does he work well he can he works on his laptop he could work anywhere and they didn't get it and so my first year i made like 20 grand and then like 50. like he's a wedding planner i think yeah like so anyway like my wife had a full-time job and she was probably making six figures straight out of college she went to an ivy league school and went to facebook anyway how has it changed the dynamics it's made it my opinion way better i do we do all of our finances together we meet once a week and we go everything do you do when i started when i started dating my wife she um she had just bought her first house she was driving a bmw m3 sport i was living under my parents house in a like they had like an unpermitted in-law unit that i lived in with my my best friend from high school who lived in there with me and uh you know that's where that's where i was he didn't have a car didn't have a house uh i had a job i had a good job i guess but um but yeah that's that's how we were when we met and then you know great what does he do he's the ceo of a startup okay so you know he's virtually virtually unemployed you know like on the brink of unemployment essentially was a situation i'll say one thing which is as you know as good things started to happen so got got promoted from like a product manager to ceo of like the company and then from ceo to like you know investing and then selling the company and all that stuff there was definitely a period where i got a little cocky um where not intentionally but i look back now and i'm like i was kind of kind of being a dick i sort of thought all these people i hang out with that are like you know super successful i felt like they they didn't have to deal with any of the [ __ ] at home that i was dealing with it's like okay yeah i gotta take out the trash you know does my investor take out the trash i don't know maybe he's got somebody takes out the trash for him right like oh i have to you know wake up at like right now i wake up in the morning at seven o'clock and from seven to ten am i you know i'm on daddy duty taking care of the baby and i was sort of like don't were we supposed to have like nannies for this i was like very uh spoiled in that sense and i thought well no i'm the like successful working guy right so like i don't have to do these like normal things and so that was my like entitlement to myself and then i realized two things one is uh yeah those guys do that too that's you know a lot of the people that i was talking about that i admire they did all that too they just didn't complain about it like a little [ __ ] and then the second thing was that they um that like who cares like do whatever uh do whatever works for you and your family and like stop being stop holding your time as more valuable than my wife's time or that my kid's time or my dog's time or anybody else i used to kind of you're talking i used to think my time was the most precious and now i don't now i'm sort of like you know it's our time we got to use it how we want do you i think it's cool we're both married i think it's cool to have this like team mentality you know when my wife and i so i i we're both catholic and even though we don't practice anything i was like we have to get married in a catholic church it was important to me and what that means is you got to meet with the priests and he was like so why are you getting married and we were like well we have similar values in life we have the same goals we just we both want to take over everything we um want to have children and raise them in a particular type of way we want to share our assets and pull together and he's like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what about love you guys love each other and we're like oh yeah yeah yeah that too and so like for us it was definitely we definitely love each other but also there was a functional partnership yeah it's like it's very this is a very practical way to like live go through life like it's very it's easier for one another when you have someone that who's family you can count on them no matter what they're gonna have your back so anyway i've enjoyed uh having a little bit of success while being uh married if you're single i guess the pros could be like you could just like fool around with people way out of your league but i do think that it would be exhausting and actually probably not as fulfilling but maybe more fun man i look back now when i use i was single you know i was 25 years old single didn't own a possession in the world and i was managing a bunch of people who were 10 20 years older than me had kids had families had mortgages had all the stuff and i thought at the time i was being super understanding about it and now when i look back i'm like oh my god i was such a idiot like i just didn't understand how how hard it is for these people to give this much to a startup um when they have all these responsibilities and obligations at home and i was you know just a free bird 25 years old and you know i could piss my time away it didn't matter and like for these people that extra one hour they were at work was now through off the whole dinner time bedtime schedule for them their kids their wife you know like all this stuff and so i just look back now and i you know i apologize to anybody i worked with then because i didn't truly understand i thought you know this hustle culture was there was the right answer then and now and i didn't realize how much they were already giving uh and i always wanted more what um yeah let's do two more um what pandemic behavior do you want to maintain um yeah basically the last year was you know it sounds insensitive so whatever maybe that's that's the case but last year was the best year of my life um same you know i had a blast and a whole bunch of life events happened right i had a kid i became a dad and you know but i just everything i grew up my hair i built a home gym i started working out regularly i you know um you know i'm working from home so i just had way more time with my family with my wife uh than when i was commuting every day and was at the office all day um you know this podcast has been a lot of fun this has been like 10 amazing things that happened this year that made this year literally the best year of my life so uh in terms of pandemic behavior i would say i definitely don't like getting close to people and shaking their hands anyway so you know good i'm just going to keep not doing that but i would say like the home gym daily workout at 1 pm is definitely the behavior i need to like keep going with i agree i've i've gotten in wonderful shape throughout this and uh that's the one i'm going to maintain yeah um all right last one maybe um i'm curious about this favorite purchase one all right uh okay let's do let's do three of these let's do um if you were 21 again what would you be doing i can't stand that question but i'll answer it yeah what is it if i was 21 now in 2021 i don't i don't know what would let me think what would you be what would you do i think i would go on tour with in the most like interesting spaces with the most interesting people so i think what i would do is i would say hey i'm a hired gun you pay me whatever pay me 5k a month 10k a month something like that uh flat fee i'm gonna come work my ass off for you uh for three months if i love it i'll stay on but by default you're gonna get just like somebody unbelievable just right hand man to to deal with any headaches or problems you have and you'll never see somebody you know work harder and smarter at figuring [ __ ] out than me and i would pick basically like four or five people that i thought were amazing um that were doing things in interesting fields doing interesting projects and i would pitch that to them and i would if they said no i would find the next five people and i would just i would go on tours i would when i would treat 21 i would treat work like a tree i would treat um like marriage in the sense that i would focus on dating figure having fun figuring out what i love what i like figuring out what likes me and um i would be in no rush to like find the project or start the company or like pick a career i would say cool i'm gonna go on i'm gonna have these these little three-month relationships with badass people in badass bases and um you know just just i commit to doing that for two years and then i'll figure it out after that like a that'll be my mormon mission i would probably my goal at 21 would be how to become a liquid millionaire by 25 and then after 25 i could dedicate a little bit more time to like a big purpose or how do i create cash flow and so i think i would want to start a blog or something like that and try to sell it in the next two or three years i would i would not try to do that because um i think that you know if we're measuring the score on like a i don't know 10 year period or 20 year period then i think i would get more value by being at the cutting edge of certain spaces certain industries and being seeing what like like a plus plus players are like when i work with them and earning their trust i think that's a lot more valuable all right last question best purchase over two grand and under 100 over two grand for me got to be uh this rowing machine that i bought for about two thousand dollars it's called ergata i am obsessed with it or i bought a pretty nice uh mercedes that's really fast i go on drives every morning and in the afternoon and it just makes me happy for under a hundred dollars uh under i don't i don't know uh i i have to think what about you i would say this camera that i'm using right now um because when the whole world went remote everything's done over video and yeah i used to just use like a mac air mac air laptop makes you look like you know an actual like prisoner of war in uganda when you go on a video call and so uh this having a dope camera is great for the pod but it's great for every single meeting i feel like i feel like i'm putting my best forward and i look great i feel great i think the other person you know treats you differently depending on how you show up and so i think this one camera is like the equivalent of buying you know a closet full of ten thousand dollar suits you know and without any of the headache of like wearing a suit so my under 100 is an aeropress i love my aeropress what does it love it that's a coffee thing it's a coffee coffee thing it's like a it makes individual cups coffee is badass i use it all the time uh under a hundred dollars okay i got this for free from jack smith jack gave me his thera gun and i [ __ ] love the thera gun um yeah he gave it to you yeah he had like an old one or something like that he he he he got a new one or i don't know what i don't know why he i had to go buy a knockoff on amazon yeah that's what i was gonna do and actually then he messaged me was like hey i have one i'll send it to you and i was like oh i'll buy it and he's like no no just what's your address i'll send it to you and i was like jack good guy and now i told i sent him a message i was like dude i use this thing every night i think of you every night because i'm like i love this gun i love jack for giving me this gun this thing is amazing do you want um do you want an update on some numbers yeah so this month may may is over now but in may we're doing a podcast push so we got about 630 000 listens so that was the number we were uh to put that in perspective that's plus i think 34 39 month over month and so that's 40 month from april to may and then the month before april march march to april was a 30 and then the month before was also a 30 right so basically since you started saying i'm going to focus on growth this thing started growing between 30 and 40 month over month we've doubled in the time that you said i remember we were at 300 something thousand then now we're at 600 something thousand yeah downloads per minute now i don't think i think june might be stable the reason why is because i don't think people are going to be listening as much i saw a distinct drop on monday like mondays we normally have 35 000 listeners this monday was 18 000. right so i think i think we might hit a little trough of sorrow but that's okay we gotta know to expect that but we're gonna keep training but i think that we're gonna hit a million soon and here's some more stats our top rating we are number eight in itunes and in spotify in the business category which is pretty good number eight number eight wow uh we are at number eight still right now on spotify and for some reason we were number one in britain in the investing category i have no idea why uh but that's the updated numbers i'm pretty proud i think you should be proud too um a few things that people loved trungs thing was amazing people loved his your short ones people loved um you did one today on but that was june but yeah people liked it so far i think yeah um i uh i'm gonna i'm i'm posting that on youtube but i'm because it's like my story i'm gonna put that on my youtube i think i deserve that and i think that uh that's gonna go viral but uh the numbers were good we grew a lot it's working i think the best thing you said was to there will be a plateau whether it's this month or the next month there's always a plateau and i've talked about this before which was one of the biggest lessons learned as somebody trying to build [ __ ] is that these plateaus happen you should you know i used to think oh plateau means the you know the world is the sky is falling this isn't working uh you know change everything no uh blah blah blah and it's like no you know the dabbler quits and goes and does a different thing the stressor gets freaked out by the plateau thinks that they did something wrong and takes it personally and the master says oh there you are i thought you'd be here soon hello uh and then sort of dances with the plateaus and figures out how to get to the next level again so i think we're gonna probably plateau somewhere here in the six to seven hundred thousands per month before we shoot through the million per month and i was working with my wife yesterday she wants to launch a course you've inspired her shawn and she was all excited to start this thing she's been talking for a month it's a great idea and yesterday she was like halfway through recording the content and everything and she was like i feel horrible i'm like ah you're there right right you're there i'm like the 40 park yes yes and i like i talked to her and i was teasing with her but i was like sarah do you know why i'm good at what i do is because i know that that is normal and i keep going and you know why most people are not uh what who they want to be is that's where they stop right but so what you have to know is that point where you you start high and then you get to low when you're a little bit into it you have to a recognize that's very normal that is incredibly normal and then you keep going just like if you're exercising you're like oh i'm starting to sweat i'm starting to sweat it's like oh okay that's normal that's part of it now you got to keep going keep going right right right exactly if you if you put down the the butt you know the the dumbbell every time your muscles started to burn you would nev never you never grow right because the burn is right where it starts you know the growth starts and so i think for pre-launch there's three points everybody hits that the first time you hit them you react pretty poorly typically uh the first is the overthinking phase that's before you get started the second is the [ __ ] this is the the the the despair this is never gonna work this sucks uh the thing i was so excited about now that i'm doing it and it's harder than i thought is this ever going to be good that's where your wife's at right now yeah and then there's the last bit when you're at the 90 mark and the perfectionist comes out and says no no no no it's not good enough yet people aren't going to like this it's not going to work and you're actually at the 90 to 95 percent mark and the perfectionist wants to pull you back to 50 and say no no we need to do all this other stuff before we go out there so i think those three points overthinking then the point of despair and then the um the perfectionist point they have been pre-launched of every project yes so it's very normal um so let's talk about a couple ideas which i think you're gonna you've got some stuff yeah by the way also the live shows are happening i guess by the time this gets released they'll have already happened so you know whatever but after this like literally i might have to keep this ten minutes short because i gotta pack my bag i'm coming to your house in austin and then we're going to miami it's gonna be awesome can i just say that i think this is gonna be a game changer for us i think that we're gonna see it's gonna be fun to see these excited people you know what's crazy is shawn and i like planned to do this like two weeks ago or we've been talking about it and then one day he texted me he goes do you want to go to miami for this time and we were going to go to crash someone's event i don't even know but we just said pocket yeah in done it's subtle like we did over at text and then we got everyone rallied around it and i think a hundred people ish are gonna come to the austin one and then i think we're at 500 for miami and it wasn't until today that i thought and we're speaking tomorrow so recording this on a wednesday but you're hearing it on friday it wasn't until just now when i right before the podcast i told dan what to do but i was like oh i guess we have to figure out what we're going to say right what are we going to talk about so i told dan i go dan send out a google form to all the attendees and just have three things what look what city you're in uh what question you want answered and what your first name is and then we'll just like see the trends of questions and then maybe we can just rattle i think you told me that idea and and and we'll just rattle that off but uh yeah it's cool man you know like what if this this sounds so lame because it's just internet nerds like you and me but what if like me oh and jack butcher's coming now uh what if like me you and jack and andrew and all these like like these losers online yeah if we had like a nerds on tour i'm pretty sure we could get like 10 000 people to come to each one yeah yeah i think nerds on tour is a cool idea i think we should just do it uh maybe you know early next year we go nerds on tour uh that's actually a great idea it's isn't it funny how the name is great dan let's grab that domain nerds on tour let's see if that's available right now all right you want to uh what do you got what do you got okay so let's do some ideas um okay so neighborhood 7-elevens so what is i love neighborhood 7-elevens by the way so i don't know what kind of neighborhood you live in i'll find out when i go to your house tonight but uh my neighborhood is kind of like i'm in the suburbs and so i don't know in this neighborhood there might be 100 homes and there's like a gate at the front it's sort of like one of those neighborhoods where it takes you seven minutes to just get from your house to the front of the neighborhood because you're you know you want to go to the grocery store the grocery store is only two miles away but like takes you seven minutes to get out of your neighborhood and then another ten minutes to get there it's 17 minutes like round trip and um and there's just like a hundred of these neighborhoods or a thousand of these neighborhoods in the suburbs like everywhere i go in the suburbs of california it's like this and so i started thinking about uh two two ideas that came together as one in my head so the first was there's a startup we had talked about called bridge no more and yeah we talked when we talked about that it was like just starting i'm pretty sure it's a huge thing already well they just raised yeah 15 20 million dollars or something like that um love those guys and uh you know was considering investing i just thought the value is a little high but uh but yeah anyways i i think it's really cool concept and their concept is it's called fridge no more because like look in the future you won't even need a fridge why because when you want something you'll just push a button you want like you know two ice creams great they'll show up at your door in like under 15 minutes how do we do that well we have these like super small kind of like cloud uh corner stores that are just like we'll have like a hundred in every city and these cloud corner stores will be able to dispatch an order to you in a very small amount of time with a very low um like delivery fee and uh and go puff does this on college campuses that's like a multi-billion dollar company i think and so i started thinking about in the suburbs the challenge uh is a little bit different and i thought why don't neighborhoods just have a neighborhood corner store okay well how would that work so you told me about the vending machines thing last podcast so it got me thinking okay that was a good one right that was a good one as i was driving through my neighborhood i was like look at all these garages like would somebody not want 500 a month to turn their garage or part of their garage into basically just like fridges and freezers and then it could just get you know basically you just deliver to the uh you deliver to the neighborhood garage that's the neighborhood corner store all the bulk wholesale goods you know your your water your all your drinks your sodas your uh snacks and your like ice creams or whatever and then in the neighborhood you would just have it where you just order and either you go pick it up uh out of the girl out of that garage or you know some kid in the neighborhood can just pick up the order make five bucks for just taking it from one part of the neighborhood to the other uh to bring it to you and uh the key would be the convenience of the speed of this that you could get it in like you know under 10 minutes to get something delivered to you so basically the idea is take the idea of 711 but use the sharing economy so put put a mini 711 inside of garages inside of all these suburban neighborhoods what do you think of this idea i've got strong feelings so before um well just let me let me let me get to it the sharing economy so kind of really got popular with airbnb uber i remember 2013 in the same way that all the older school magazines are all talking about crypto it was like the sharing economy so there's a sharing economy for everything back in 2013 2014 and it was all we talked about and i've looked at the data and i've like tried to figure all this out i am almost positive that the sharing economy only works for like two or three things uber and driving um airbnb home rentals and maybe that's it i've seen sharing economy stuff have you ever seen i just got pitched on this the other day and i just can never get i never am on board with it sharing economy for like youtube like tools and your yeah this idea has been around and recycled like a trillion times like hey why do i have to buy a drill my neighbor has a drill you know i just want to use it once why don't i just rent the drill on demand locally that idea never works or at least it hasn't ever and there's probably a reason why it hasn't um there's a bunch of these sharing economy things like one was like you go to someone's home and you cook dinner with them or they like a private like if it's a cooking lesson you know right even airbnb experiences doesn't really work that well as a business it works as a nice little add-on thing for them but that's not like where their value is um and i've always thought that sharing economy for most things is a horrible idea i used to share an office when i first started my company it was me sieva and one other company i think they were called rooster or something and they were trying to get people to make it was like storage so they were like wanted people to rent storage in other people's garage and i would hear these guys on their phone trying to call constantly trying to get and they had zero users and i heard them trying to get user one user two i heard all the whole thing they would walk around on the phone it was so hard to convince anyone and when they did convince someone it never worked and so in terms of sharing economy stuff and like uh like this idea i'm almost always default to i don't know that seems really difficult do you agree um i don't agree with uh okay i do agree that it's difficult but uh like on the storage one so for people who don't know there was a a batch of startups all trying to do this which was hey airbnb lets you rent out the excess space in your bedrooms your house um why don't we rent let you rent out excess space in your garage and so omni started this way they ended up shutting down after raising a bunch of money um clutter tried to do the same thing clutter changed i believe they've made it but maybe they pivoted i don't know what it's now just a normal ass like we come pick up your stuff and store it in a warehouse distorted warehouses okay so yeah so i don't know what the uh what what went wrong there but that was one that i would believe could work right because if i have extra space blah blah and these things you don't get they don't get used very much so they sort of just stay in storage for the most part there's one reason why i mean and i and i've thought about this convenience it's all about convenience so it's the convenience that has to pay for itself so uh having someone stay in my house is relatively inconvenient but i could make like three grand a month pretty consistently right okay yeah so it's not about convenience it's about money well no it's a balance it's it's like it's my convenience at a price now having someone store [ __ ] in my garage for 80 a month which is how much it costs to store stuff at a normal uh storage unit that's just [ __ ] not worth it i don't it's not worth it to me it's a pain in the ass and it's not worth it it's way too inconvenient right yeah so i think there is you know this trade-off i would also say i think a lot of people merge these ideas together so for example sharing economy what does share economy mean it means taking excess resources that are unutilized and getting them to be utilized right airbnb excess space get them to be utilized then there's like gig economy gig economy is like more like uber um right like push a button and uh like push a button the guy's gonna come pick you up and it's not so much excess resources because that guy it's not like that guy was just happened to be driving by anyways it's like no he just made this his job um and gig economy so then people started trying to do that with like masseuses right like push button a masseuse will come to your house um you know like pedicures at your house or whatever whatever every every random thing and then there's sort of like creator economy which is like a totally different thing altogether and so people started just like using these words pretty interchangeably and i think that doesn't work and in general almost all these are two-sided marketplaces which are just like effing hard to do it's really effing hard to start a two-sided marketplace and when you do the prize is a billion dollars you know in your pocket and so you know it shouldn't be it really shouldn't be that easy but uh i agree so i agree with you that this probably a wouldn't work or b uh would be like a real pain in the ass to do but good idea sean yeah but interesting idea in the sense that um i think it would be pretty game-changing in terms of convenience because it would be essentially like a cold vending machine inside of neighborhoods right like you know like a super vending machine inside of neighborhoods and if you could get it to work you now have every sort of suburban neighborhood uh you know to go spread into where uh a lot of stuff is done in cities partly because the people who build startups tend to live in cities not in the burbs and so um so a lot of stuff works in the cities because that's where they live that's what they know and then people are really densely packed into one area and so it's hard to get things to work at a neighborhood level you ever been to a truck stop where they have like just a slab of concrete with benches and like 10 different vending machines all right there were just like an awning and then you could we'll just do that let's just do that in the burbs we're just going to get that slab and put all those vetting machines right in there well that's the thing like the question is what would you sacrifice one home for right because you need the space so either it's got to go inside of a home right in the garage in the backyard and inside the house or it has to be so valuable that you could justify just buying one of the homes and converting it into some like commerce basically for the neighborhood and getting the permits to do it which is you know once we start talking permits it's time to change ideas okay i got another i got another suburban idea for you so um the new golf so my buddy ben got invited to go play in this pickup game is pick a basketball game and uh it's he didn't want to turn it down because it was like like ballers yeah there's a bunch of ballers that were like gonna go play there there's like basic baller not real ballers well half half were actual like you know like good ballers and you know people who are like you know this guy's gonna get drafted this year this guy trains the nba players what the [ __ ] isn't ben like a little guy yeah but we met the guy who's the trainer for the nba players this guy alex and i forgot his company name last time so i'll shout out this time through the lens he's the one building the master class for athletes so um through the lens so anyways alex was organizing this game and he was like hey you wanna go come play in this you're i know you're in new york also so uh come by and if you're if you're a nba fan you always see on instagram all the nba players in the summer go play in this one gym that's like um it's like in an apartment building so it's like yeah my my friend used to live in that building like sky or something i don't know what it's called but it's like yeah it's in new york yeah it's like this exclusive thing and it'll be like lebron and carmelo and kevin durant all playing in this like little gym whatever so the guy was like hey we're gonna go play tomorrow on that gym you wanna come he's like [ __ ] yeah like all right who's there and it's like a bunch of like you know i don't know billionaires children and like you know want to be nba players or whatever so they went and played and i was like how was it he's like i was good but like you know hey i suck and b um you know i'm just trying not to get hurt right like he's like once you know you're 30 you got like i just had a kid like i just can't afford to get hurt and i'm not playing regularly so i'm you know i just kind of like played it easy i guess which is kind of lame but that was the truth i said well you know same here i basically played basketball as like my favorite thing to do until i was like 27 and then like since then i've just been like well the odds of me spraining an ankle or spraining a knee is just too high i can't like actually play the sport anymore properly and so i kind of opted out so i started thinking about like at every age there's a different sport that's like right for you so you know maybe in your 20s and 30s it could be something like basketball or soccer in your 40s you really there's not many 45 year old like pick up basketball players that are that are going out there there's always you know maybe the one old dude who's like barely barely moving but for the most part you need to graduate to another sport that is that matches your life athleticism so it might be tennis and you know a little bit older might be golf and then a little bit older like i think that the sort of end sport is basically uh just playing poker you can just do that in a wheelchair and you know it's like the last thing you can do as like some kind of form of sport or competition and so uh so anyways it got me thinking like okay if i'm i'm about to shift into the like tennis phase okay cool fine uh pickleball bro so then i started thinking about pickleball because i was like what is pickleball pickleball is mini tennis that is like kind of the best of tennis but it's also easier on the body right am i right about pickleball i haven't played yeah that's what i see okay you don't have to run no i would say it's as hard on the body but it's like it requires close to no skill right so okay the skill cap might be different uh but i also think there's less less running around and jumping into it but like anyone can do it right so so it's more accessible that's kind of the point and then i was thinking about golf because i think once you hit i don't know 50 plus it seems like golf is the major sport for that age and golf is like the least [ __ ] accessible thing right it's super expensive it takes the whole day it's hard as [ __ ] to like even be decent at golf um so i'm like how is it it's amazing to me this even worked right like it's kind of like mind-blowing golf even even has any popularity so what's the point what's the new one what is the new golf so can i tell you what i've been using yeah what are you doing i when i have friends in town or uh you and i won't have enough time maybe we will tomorrow but uh like i had a friend named brennan come over whenever people visit uh i go um 5 5 p.m thursday or whatever come to my house and wear tennis shoes and i've bought tons and tons of wraps and so they get there i throw them hand wraps and i go we're gonna box today and i throw them their thing and we wrap up our hands up i go all right we're gonna warm up with some mitts i'll show you how to punch we do that and then i go all right here's an extra mouth guard we're sparring uh and uh i i lead him and i we don't hit hard yeah uh but like if they want every once in a while i won't hit them hard in the face but i'll get up in there and then i'll pop them really hard in the stomach just so they could feel alive yeah they feel what it's like to be alive and then i'll let them punch me i had a guy to chip my tooth the other day and it's been the greatest bonding experience i've done it with men women everyone with the women like well she'll pop me real hard and i'll hit her in the stomach like it's awesome man it is awesome i've loved doing this with boxing it brings you together it makes you feel alive and it's a fun sport because we could do it in my garage and you normally don't box because it's embarrassing to try that in front of a bunch of people are you afraid to get killed yeah yeah and i know we're not gonna like and they'll see me i go put i go put your hands up watch and we'll i like my moves so slow i'll just kind of tap them i'm like look that's all we're doing we're just gonna barely touch each other yeah so i think in the i think 30s maybe even 40s boxing works i think beyond that uh boxing also doesn't work because you know for obvious reasons um so so i think you're you're doing the thing where you're basically as you shift in age you like shift in sport um and i've seen like i think i talked about this once before but like people have taken like so so i was talking to my friend sahil uh this guy saw him bloom people might have seen him on twitter he's got a big twitter now and uh we were we were eating and he was talking about he used to be a baseball player at stanford he's a pitcher and he's like you know i got hurt you know that kind of ended my pro aspirations and then it was sort of like well this thing the sport i've dedicated myself to forever is pretty much useless to me at this point right like i will never play pick up baseball like what am i going to do go find nine friends on one side nine on the other side that all like baseball in the ass all i have four hours to kill and uh you know we have the right skills where we can like pitch and catch uh you know like most people can't even sit in the catcher's squat like you know it's just you're never going to play baseball again and that's true like baseball is sort of the worst trend worst access sport at an early age i think golf is the worst one at a later age and so i think that if somebody could take the characteristics that make golf work and create their version of pickleball i think you'd own a pretty valuable asset and i'm on the lookout to see what is this next one because i have several friends that didn't invent pickleball but when pickleball started to get popular they built pickleball businesses some you know uh i can't say their names they actually they've like literally asked me not to but uh one of them is they did equipment so like they just built like you know like an amazon fba business selling pickleball stuff and they were able to rank at the top because at the time pickleball wasn't that competitive but it got more and more popular over time and then other people started leagues and there's other people that are bar stools i think doing something on the media side i don't know there's a bunch of different ways you can ride these waves of new sports and so what makes golf work is that it's i think it's outdoors um i think that it's uh you know it's a chill sport so it doesn't require like running jumping squatting like stuff like that like it's you know old guys can swing the club too um and then all the bad parts you would have to change so you'd have to find a way to make it a 60 minute or 90 minute experience um you would need you know golf's cool because you can do it by yourself you can do with one other person or do with four people so that's good i'd keep that um you would not want to have it be where you need like thousands of dollars of equipment just to get started um or like you know pay to go do this thing and then you'd also want it to be where a beginner can like feel some sort of success and not just like like i went to a golf course what about spike ball too athletic dude you think you're still thinking like you you have athleticism still you got to think about you 30 years from now you got a bum hip the testosterone that you've been taking for 30 years has now wiped you out you're you know you you're going to be in a different phase you're going to need a different sport at that time i think it's got to feel like i just go for walks yeah but the walks don't have the thing that the boxing is giving to you where you get to scratch the competitive itch and you get to do like kind of like um you get to feel alive you can still feel like you're doing something uh walking is sort of like the most basic i think you got to take like shuffleboard uh shuffleboard level of like movement and make it a like outdoor activity i don't know what's that one sport that old people play that's like um bochie watchy i don't know what bocce ball is maybe this is bocce ball that i'm describing but i feel like maybe something like bocce ball is what's gonna what's gonna pick up so we need to go to questions i think you're not a fan of the new golf i'm not a fan of the new golf dude i'm telling you it's gonna happen you're gonna see the sport rise in popularity amongst older people and you'll be like [ __ ] sean was right there was an appetite for a sport for older people that's not called golf maybe but like i can't it's just like such an impossible thing to predict i mean like i would be it'd be better predicting which companies would be a billion dollar company than which sport is gonna be who like who would have thought a sport named pickleball was gonna be sick yeah i don't know i would have put my money on slam ball but you know just to show what i know dan do we um do we have uh what's it called did we get the merch so we have stickers we have shirts for the tour yep we got stickers we got shirts we got hoodies and then my first business in college was making buttons so i got some buttons for you guys too do you have the shirts with you i don't they got shipped out yesterday they are arriving uh tomorrow into miami okay great so austin austin no shirts miami shirts everything's going to miami yep okay and what about um and what who's the guy who uh designed the shirts let's give that guy a shout out too yeah let me uh pull it up dustin is his first name and he's like he's like a creative agency or like a kind of a design company or something yeah he's got a creative agent from las vegas i've tweeted out you know hey give us some you know somebody give some designs we'll we'll we'll hook you up and uh his were by far the most kind of like favorited or liked uh by people who said like you know pick this one these are the winners yeah dustin ionati he's got an agency out in las vegas called artisans on fire artisan's on fire okay sweet yeah artist on fire go check that out uh and he made the post economic shirt that's gonna fly off the shelves are we giving this away are we charged for them i didn't hear the the end result i got square set up so you guys tell me all right we'll just head over down there all right can i hear one a funny observation yeah yeah so i've been listening to you guys for like a year now always on one and a half x so one of the weirdest things is having to listen to you guys in real time i've heard that before yeah sean sounds like he's a couple drinks in i can't believe that uh but i talk faster than sam right i feel like i'm i think we both have nervous energy well you talk really fast at one and a half x yeah that's fair i can't believe people listen to this on on speed this doesn't make sense to me all right i gotta go i'll talk to you soon i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on a road less travel never looking back

so i like these like big things software companies that can scale but when i heard him describing this i'm like god i want to get in on this like this is still like you know what i mean i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to what's up sean here we got sam and today's episode we're going to talk about a blue collar side hustle aka the hillbilly of the week which is a vending machine business and sam breaks down all the numbers behind it we talk about this idea of creating the edible arrangements of doordash through ghost kitchens we talk about the new uh hottest app in the app store the number one app aka is this the next snapchat is this the next clubhouse we don't know it's called paparazzi and i tell a story around that and we talk about vimeo a you know a business you've probably heard of but may not realize that vimeo is now a 8 billion dollar business and then at the end we shoot the with abreu and uh the new abra you dan and you get to meet him a little bit so that's the last i don't know five ten minutes of the episode all right great episode enjoy all right what's up yo you know what's funny i put out that thing for um for merch designs and somebody had a great one that was all right so the funny ones i thought were somebody made a yada yada yada shirt with your face on it i thought that was funny and then somebody made one that just goes it's both of our faces it's both our faces like kind of illustrated and it just says i'll pray you we good which is what you say at the end of every episode do i really yeah i uh and then another guy so sean we're doing this meetup in miami um by the way i feel like that undersells it right live show we're going on tour that sounds more badass than we're doing a meetup well yes you're right but there's two things going on here the first i was downplaying it because i frankly i didn't know how many people are going to show up yeah so we set the limit originally at 400 and then uh our venue now is changing and so we don't i don't know how many going to see right so we capped it now at 3 35 that's how many rsvps we have now so if more open up we're going to open it up when i was doing it to like make it so if i failed it would be okay um and also so when you're talking about show i know that you're i think you're pretty comfortable on stage and you actually aspire to be kind of a professional comedian i have no idea what we're actually going to talk about we haven't even we haven't even said a word to each other about what are we going to do there yeah so uh we'll figure it out but basically the way it's working and we agreed to as per usual we agree to stuff without thinking it through but basically we have a thing in austin at 6 00 p.m on thursday that's probably going to end at 10 p.m and then we have a 7 a.m flight and i think that flight is gonna land at noon 12 30 in miami these are the logistics people came to listen for well sorry but anyway it's just we have a lot we're going to be running them out a million miles an hour you know what i thought was would be a fun idea i just thought about actually while i was putting my contacts in before this i go what are we going to say on stage what would be a good live show because i was like either we just do research and we just have like a fire episode where it's like great ideas great billy of the week great business breakdown we could have that ready i said or we could do it you know like when you go to a comedy show and they they take your phone they zip it up so you're like you can't record this it's like well if they showed up live what can we give them that special that we can't just say on air so i thought maybe i think each of us probably has a few business stories war stories that we could share that are entertaining that you could do kind of an off the record format um and i feel like we could put out five stories that we could tell about stuff you know or three or four stories at least that could be entertaining about you know uh something something something that happened that is uh you wouldn't just like you wouldn't go publish a blog post about it because it's not necessarily the details you can't get out to everybody but in a trusted group of some of our you know biggest fans i think that's cool a 400 person trusted group but yeah i think that's a group of strangers i think i think maybe it might default to like q and a but we'll see um it's gonna be weird we're gonna i've never i've talked i think the most amount of people i've ever talked in front of is 5 000 and that's not a big deal i can do that all day but never 5 000 people who came to see me just like riff so that's going to be weird but uh we've got a lot of ideas and you want to get straight to it yeah let's do it where do you want to start you want to actually start the vimeo one's not an idea you have this cool thing about paparazzi or po i don't actually know how to say it yeah that's actually a lesson i want to start with vimeo because there's no lesson here i just thought it was cool so did so vimeo went public two days ago i didn't even know this until i saw the tweet it was an awesome tweet about uh the woman uh was with her kid and i and saying like wishing her mom a good day's work when it goes public a good day's work to you know like uh child like good good luck it was like a three-year-old saying you know good luck as you ring the bell i i i i love that type of uh and anyway uh went public but there's a background behind vimeo so do you use vimeo i use it all the time i've you i've used it i think everybody runs into vimeo once in a while i don't use it to upload unless i'm like oh i need a high quality kind of private thing and i'm just surprised this company made it it just seemed like video was dead i think it literally died at some point but they pivoted and made it actually into a great business so tell me about it it never died so it's always been like kind of popular like for a very particular type of person i love watching it on my tv because i've got like a fancy tv and they have fancy videos like high-end videos and they particularly have like weird stuff weird music they've got what sort of uh fancy weird videos are you watching like like like waitress stuff oh there's like yeah tons of nature stuff like women stuff like what are you watching oh like uh like um like a drone flying around or something gotcha or or you know stuff that's like it's just it's kind of like it's uh oddly entertaining or they'll have really unique art pieces like an art video or so it's very niche but it's really neat i love it but the way it started is actually interesting so these guys it was a guy named ricky van i think his name is ricky van veen he started with a guy named josh and it started and a guy named zack three of them they were only 18 and they started this company called college humor and you know college humor of course we're a similar age we if you're young and listening to this you probably don't know it but basically it was like jerry but before instagram exactly or bar stool sports but not sports right and it was like a kind of a smutty it wasn't smut but it was like snl online and it was cool and it was one of the first blogs and they started it and it got going and they also uh had little side projects these guys lived in new york and they were just like your typical like 20 year old cool new yorker guy where they like you would see their life and they would start little side projects it was really fun one of their side projects was a video uploading tool that they built because they were uploading videos before youtube was around and that was vimeo and barry diller who we have to do a deep dive on he's very fascinating he started this company called iac they're pretty huge they've owned match.com which they spun out to be his own business they own uh tinder they want a ton of stuff angie's list and anyway he bought that for 20 million dollars in 2006 and he's held it now for almost 15 years vimeo they spun it out so what barry diller and isd does is they buy these companies they employ people to run them and they grow them not like crazy fast they grown and then they spit them out to go public and it works often and they went public recently they bought this business for 20 million dollars it's now worth 8 billion is that crazy that's insane publicly traded worth 8 billion by the way if vimeo is worth 8 billion youtube's worth what 800 like youtube must be youtube is yeah more valuable than vimeo so that just seems a little off right like dude vimeo does like four or five hundred or six so it's like many almost close to uh it's half a billion ish in revenue yeah but youtube there's like 20 billion in revenue it's crazy right it's like yeah well i'm agreeing with you youtube should be worth a lot but i don't think vimeo so explain the niche so vimeo basically did what they went they sort of pivoted from consumers uploading videos to more like businesses or creative people filmmakers you know type of people uploading videos is that right yeah so if you want to upload a video and you want to upload it quickly and you want to upload it in the highest uh highest quality possible you'll use vimeo and you'll buy a creator's account they also let you do some editing online that makes it a little bit easier you can add some captions things like that uh you can have a people will use it to like store their portfolio um and so what you'll see if you go on there and you type in like nature you'll see some video and like then you'll see like oh wait this has this is by yeti and it's yeti hosting a lot of their cool videos that they'll pay a creator to make for them as like an ad and no i don't actually know where they even display those videos other than vimeo but uh like you'll see um what's the code com what's the outdoors company that uh let my people go surfing north face the north face guy like you'll see him fishing in a stream telling like the story about the background of the company right so it's a lot of uh outdoorsy a lot of brand stuff it's pretty interesting uh the niche i don't actually know how to describe that niche but it's kind of interesting like it's all people who want to have higher quality stuff than youtube in terms of like resolution and they also do a couple things that they like goes against their culture like they don't have view counts they don't have a sort by popularity thing so it makes it a little bit easier to discover to discover uh stuff that you normally wouldn't have seen well it's good by then because all the other video upload sites whether it's like dailymotion or like all those other ones they all died right youtube just uh youtube youtube took over it ate it ate everybody up and vimeo squirted away and found a niche that works for them that is actually like an eight billion dollar niche right it ended up ended up working out and not like a oh that's a lifestyle business kind of way so you know props to them because i don't think this was the i don't think this was what most people would have bet was it would be the outcome once youtube started growing like it did so the company vimeo has 200 million uh users so 200 million people a month i believe go and use them and also they have 1.6 million paying subscribers so pretty substantial um another company that i didn't put on here but is killing it in video do you remember weebly yeah oh sorry not weebly what's the other one sort of the w w wistia you know wistia so whiskey is in the same thing so wistia is kind of an interesting company they also start in 2006 and they were based out of boston and they raised a ton of money built this business to be like 30 40 50 million recurring revenue and then they bought out their shareholders they raised money from pp uh from kkr the pe company and bought out their investors i bet you that company could be potentially worth a billion dollars as well um but they're kind of doing something similar yeah you know when last episode i had this thing or not the mark lower one but the one before that where i said you know one of my one of my learnings that one of the counter-intuitive things that i learned is never underestimate these mega trends uh even when you feel like you're late you're early um and there's another version of that which is even when you even when you're niche you're big with with a mega trend and so uh mark zuckerberg came out i don't know what it was i didn't start using this term megatrend until i heard zuck use it i think five years ago when he goes video is a mega trend i thought oh that's interesting facebook's not even at that time facebook wasn't even about video they hadn't launched watch the feed was mostly photos and text updates and but they see everything right facebook knows what's going on on the internet they know exactly where all the opportunities are whether they can capture them or not and for video i thought huh what does he mean by megatrend and i think what it means is like mobile like the internet like now video social these were um there were like trends of trends meaning like they were going to transform basically every space and so you saw that we saw this with video all of a sudden newspapers are you know the kind of the meme in for media companies was we're pivoting to video right um which is like used to write articles and now you produce videos um you know same thing happened with with instagram you know more and more instagram content shifted from photos to videos either through stories or posts or now like reels or tick tocks and so video just has just eaten up more and more share of people's attention and what the internet is used for and i think that that's pretty pretty fascinating and i think this is a good example of video is such a big mega trend that even being the niche kind of like the the video uploading site for creative makers hobbyists fishermen and photographers it's like boom eight billion dollar you know 80 billion dollar company if you end up winning that space that niche and so yeah just another example of do not underestimate a mega trend don't think you're don't think you're late when it's a mega trend and don't be afraid of going niche because even the niches are big with megatrends i would say today's mega trends my personal bets are that today's mega trends are anything that's actually real in machine learning or ai as well as crypto i think those are the two mega trends that are happening right now speaking of mega trend something happened the other day an app like went crazy viral and you kind of have an insider story of it yeah a little bit okay so there's this app so i'll i'll tell you kind of my my my learning here friend uh friend of the pod actually he's never come on but one of our friends or i don't know if you know him very well he's got nikita beer he um he's an entrepreneur his company was tbh got acquired by facebook for 100 million dollars in a really crazy way uh they basically were grinding trying to build like social products like you know the next the next twitter the next snapchat for a while many years and we're just getting really really smart about it learning a bunch of stuff but never hitting the home run and i think about a few months before they ran out of ran out of money they just threw you know they were either gonna wind it up just all right let's all go get jobs or you know get aqua hired somewhere they uh they threw one last attempt and they made this app called tbh and it went viral amongst high schoolers it was like a app where you're kind of like answering questions or polls about your friends you know who's most likely to blah blah blah or who is your favorite person about blah blah blah um and then it was a place to go you know can i post like a social network for high schoolers takes off facebook buys it for i think 100 million bucks was the reported price how do you think that deal was structured 100 million dollars for an app that doesn't like it's brand new i have no idea um obviously it was an overpay you know months later tbh shut down uh you know no longer it was kind of a fad right it didn't have legs uh they shut it down and they kept you know some most of the talent and so anyways he's been there for a little while so he tweets out when the app store refreshes there's a new king 500 000 installs on day one all right you got my attention i'll bite what is it and people start speculating what it is and i thought sort of i i sort of do some internet digging and uh and i find out okay there's this app called paparazzi so have you seen what the app is the app is called paparazzi it's currently the number one app in the app store it's had over a million installs and i think less than a week they're they're wait list basically they were a test flight app which is like how you give it to like uh beta testers it's not even in the app store their test flight app went viral and so they had half a million people ready and waiting to download the app as soon as so they just they just rushed it onto the app store and bang they hit the hit the number one i think they're still number one on the free charts above snapchat above tick tock above facebook above above everybody and um okay so what is paparazzi and by the way paparazzi has almost the same story as tbh these guys been working on this for a while they like three years i think years yeah they were just kind of grinding away you know small team i think they're in la and um two brothers they they almost got acquired or kind of aqua hired for single-digit millions of dollars like you know a couple of the big social networks were talking to them they could have took that you know they would have made probably you know a million bucks two million bucks amongst themselves if they did it but they said all right it yolo one more try they released this new app paparazzi and it hits um and it hits big and so we'll see if this is gonna last right no who social lapses could be like a tbh could be like a clubhouse it could be the next snapchat right that's the thing with social apps is they all start sort of start up start out looking the same they look kind of silly they sound kind of dumb and then you know you fast forward a year and then you know some people are proven right i told you that was dumb it faded away and then for some people like me my my you know i think i was right about clubhouse my famous clubhouse prediction that i think is being proven right you know their their downloads went from like 1 million to 4 million to 10 million and then back to 2 million 1 million half a million right so you have intel are you are you right i mean the download numbers would tell us a story that i'm right so far now but when i was saying it it looked like this thing was going to take off they just had 10 million downloads in a month which is insane now it looks like i'm right but of course it could turn around they may you know maybe they could uh maybe they could turn me wrong but how did this one app get to get popular so uh so i don't know exactly how how it got popped it's very cleverly architected the way their sort of flow works to get you to invite friends but i think it was just like a novel hook with this so why is it called paparazzi it's called paparazzi because on every other social network you post about yourself right i go post on instagram i post a photo from my camera that i took about me and my life and if i post a story same thing paparazzi is just like the name sounds it's other people taking pictures of you which is kind of funny right so like your profile is not pictures you upload about yourself which tends to be you kind of in a manicured setup environment making yourself look good with paparazzi it's other people taking pictures of you and that sort of is like a photo tag onto your wall and so your whole profile is just pictures that other people took of you and you can sort of like accept them or deny them if you don't like the photo or whatever and so that creates a cool dynamic where now you're getting people in more candid shots because it's other people taking photos and which makes the content more interesting it's more raw than what you're getting on on facebook it's more raw than what you're getting on instagram it's even more raw than what what snapchat was which this is the game snapchat played on facebook snapchat was more raw and candid because the photos disappeared so people they had less of a filter on what they posted but still they wanted to you know post a certain type of thing that made themselves look good this is even more raw than snapchat it's even more candid it's content that wouldn't have made it to snapchat makes it onto paparazzi which is what makes it interesting now you're getting new shared that you wouldn't have otherwise got so that's the premise of it what do you think of this never in a million years but i thought this was gonna work and i can't decide if i just have bad taste or if i'm old um is that the app i'm opening the app there's like a hype video do you uh which is cool more apps should do that they should have like a trailer like instead of a boring onboarding this thing is playing me like i want to play the music it's like let's get it pop in and then there's pictures of all these like cute boys and girls my phone is literally vibrating it's like that's the most excitement an app has ever shown me so do you but when you were looking at this did you think that this so i get that it's popular now and it's easy to say yeah i get it but no i would have never predicted this right like okay you would have told me i've been like huh that's clever but still probably not gonna work right like it seems so unlikely for anything to just like hit like this is so unlikely and it's not the expected things so you sort of by default you sort of you don't imagine that this would hit same thing with clubhouse i was like oh that's cool i've seen a bunch of things like that i don't really see why this one will go viral but it did and so it's very hard to predict with social even i spent like maybe like five six years of my life trying to build social stuff i knew everybody in the space i tried so many different things so i i would say i'm not like a novice to this stuff but it's very very hard to predict and our friend jack smith says this best he goes if you look at even the guys who invested in snapchat or whatsapp or whatever they go and they start like okay sequoia the best venture fund that's you know ever existed basically they invest in whatsapp they invested in every single round of whatsapp they led every round which was a genius move so when exits were 1920 billion bucks they were huge winners out of that cool guess what they also invested in yik yak a social product that died whisper it's those products that died right like they have a graveyard of other things they tried that didn't work out and i don't know if those are the exact ones that they invest in but they have a bunch and so jack pointed out he's like if even the best guys who have had the home runs have a bunch of swings and misses with social it just shows how hard it is to like correctly predict social before it plays out i have a friend who who who was in the seed stage um a friend of a friend he was in the seas stage of robin hood and uh a whole bunch of other stuff uh and probably worth multi billion for sure worth multi billions and someone was asking him about social apps and about consumer stuff and he goes honestly if the person is competent maybe do it but really it's just gambling and i have no idea which one's going to work he said he goes with b2b stuff i can kind of like i can look at some stuff i'm like okay i understand you can you can cut you can the likelihood that you can make this at least a mild success is quite high but with social and some basic consumer stuff it's just i'm just rolling dice and i i have very little confidence in any of it so the beautiful thing about social like who it's like who would try this right like because you're right it's so hard to predict if you're a great entrepreneur and you go into this space you are inten you're going to a casino and you're saying all right my odds at the craps table or you know 51 i'm a 49 to 1. 49 to 51 i'm 49-51 oh you have you know whatever chinese backgammon over here okay i'll go play pai gow i'm gonna go play paigo even though the odds are you know 80 chance of loss it's like why do you do that because it's a it's fun and b when you get social right you're the king of the universe right like it's like yeah my app is the one that's used by like a billion people every day of their life their whole social scene is on here they use it with their mom their friends their their girlfriend boyfriend whatever and so it just hits different when you hit social and that's that's why i love even talking about things that are social that hit because it's a rare type of game that you kind of have to be a madman to go play so let me bring up something that's the total opposite of this which is you don't have to be a madman and and the likelihood that it's going to succeed is incredibly high but it may not be like a huge winner okay just with that information do you know where i'm going with this i see vending machines on our thing and i i think that a vetting machine business is probably the most predictable simple understandable guaranteed type of business you could do is that what you're going to yeah so these uh two folks came to me and they pitched this idea they're raising money for it it's a vending machine business uh for it basically it's mostly female products so tampons and stuff in uh bathrooms and oddly enough i had another guy email me a deck about a vending machine business and i'm not going to do that one but this first one was kind of intriguing they've got some traction they're making money it's kind of intriguing and i started doing some research and i tweeted out who knows everything about who's the person he talked about vending machine it got a ton of traction for some reason i think it's a lot of people are interested in this this guy named quinn miller reached out to me and i did a call with him this morning very fascinating he worked and i just want to bring this up because this is the exact opposite of what we were just talking about right but it's oddly as compelling and as interesting even though it's the two totally different uh parts of the world so this guy he's 27 he worked in software sales he quit about a year ago to start this business he's got a vending machine business and he gave me all of his numbers and he said i could reveal it so he's about 10 months into the thing he's currently doing 15 000 in monthly revenue and he's doing that across 27 machines his startup costs were 600 500 or 400 to buy a machine and 200 to fix it and move it to the place where it had to go by the way this is our weekly blue collar side hustle this is the great college side hustle yeah so on the 15 000 in revenue 65 is profit so he's doing around uh 97 9800 a month in profit so far total investment into the biz so far after he already bought his first machine has been fifty thousand dollars time involvement per week relatively high 20 hours a week because he's actually delivering all the stuff i asked him all about i was like how does this work because the reason i reached out to this guy was i was like hey uh there's this like tampon startup it kind of looks interesting what's your tampon vending machine startup what's your opinion he goes yeah i mean i obviously don't know anything about that like too much but basically my opinion is the world uh he goes america runs on coke and monster energy drink and i was like what do you mean he goes let me let me explain so i put these vending machines i love that so let's slow down so so the guy basically buys vending machines like you and i are used to just a snack vending machine nothing nothing innovative there well he does one quote innovative thing um he puts uh he installs a credit card machine on him for about 250 bucks you can get a credit card okay so he gets a vending machine he says all right people aren't carrying quarters so i'm going to take cards he puts them uh he puts them so he buys each machine you said for 500 bucks the first one was 500 he has 27 machines uh with 50k so whatever that math is so what's that 2k a machine roughly yeah okay so he buys a thousand to two thousand dollar machine he puts it in places like what office building department yeah so he cold calls uh lower income hotels uh motels assisted living places in in uh low-income apartments so sorry low-income apartments dash or comma motels comma assistant living places okay and so he goes and he basically says hey put this here and he there's a revenue split or he pays rent how does that work so most of these businesses the way that they work is they give 10 to 20 to the real estate folk right uh this guy he goes i actually am because i sold software i'm pretty good at sales and i do what's called a value sell and he goes basically i say look your tenants are if i just improve your tenant experience by just a small percent maybe you're going to make more money because someone will want to stay or want a rent he gives him nothing he gives them nothing and so he's got a bunch of machines in like 10 different locations and he just cold calls them and then it's so unsophisticated where does he get his stuff costco so he buys a can of coke from costco for 33 cents and he charges a dollar for it right uh it's very simple uh not complicated at all by the way my grandfather used to have a vending machine so this was probably the first business i ever encountered was i think i was probably five years old and my parents you know they worked so my dad would work in an office building and he needed me to be babysat but then like you know old people also kind of need babysitting so my dad went for a two-for-one he basically bought or rented out a little like kind of like a corner store inside like a little deli inside of the office building and um and then my my grandfather ran it and we used to go like work the register at the age of you know seven um and he was like baby baby he basically he occupied his grand grandparents and his kids without having to like do any pay for any like caretakers in fact it made a little bit of money and then my grandfather had this vending machine that we used to go and do this exact refill we would go to costco buy the cokes put it in he would collect a bag of like change and then we would like go to the bank and like exchange the change and i remember being like what is this he had one vending machine as his business it sounds awesome and i asked the guy by the way this guy's name is quinn miller i'll give him a shout out quinn miller i asked him i go how big can this get he goes look i'm not trying to be offensive or anything but the operators of these businesses typically are pretty hillbilly um and so they're pretty unsophisticated which doesn't mean they're dumb they're just not sophisticated in terms of like technology or anything like that and they like there's a low-key easy life he goes but i met a guy in palm springs who had about 1600 machines and he was making anywhere from five to 10 million in revenue with about half in profit right and i was like well that's pretty amazing how else can it get big like what else is big and he said there's a company called canteen and i looked it up i i think it's public uh but they do like 15 billion in sales of this and they're the largest vending machine company in america they operate them yeah and they do distribution so the thing is is like what this guy does uh quinn he finds he finds his route so he finds a route so he's like all right if i go from destination a to b it's a straight line i'll do everything in between and so i try to find locations on the way so one truck can do all of it in an easy short amount of time and he's like i'm very specific specific about where i choose and that's where you make a lot of money is you can be very efficient with your time and so basically that's what he does and he said this company can't team just does that on a huge scale and they're ultimately at the end of the day a logistics company and a bit of a supply chain company but at this point quinn told me he was like i rented a small warehouse now because i'm getting so much freaking coke he goes the reason i like doing that and so back to tampons he goes you have to like look at what the repeat purchase rate is he goes if i go to like a lower income area these folks love coke and love monster to the point that one guy will drink five cokes a day i'm getting five dollars from them you have to ask yourself can you get that for uh tampons or other products and he goes in fact a lot of the money guys once they move from coke and monster energy they're starting to go with into what's called honesty market so basically at a wee work you know how they like you swipe your credit card and you only take one sandwich for eight dollars yeah he's like that's where the money is right now huh that's so and um yeah that's so it's almost like there's whales for the vending machine it's not like everybody buys one every three days it's like one guy drinks nine cokes a day uh or you know four red bulls you know a week and that's where you make your money is on the like 10 of the of the residents who buy like 90 of the goods or something like that probably yeah this guy was interesting man he's only 27. he's the lives in san diego worked in tech sales he told me that uh he goes like basically i'm a pr he goes i'm pretty i was pretty good at selling software um i'm not the best but i'm pretty good and this industry that i went into they're just kind of not that great at that many stuff and i could outsell relatively easily i could kind of outwork relatively easily and so anyway fascinating story so you know we have the billy of the week i think this needs to be the hilly of the week it's the hillbilly business that's actually of the week that's actually great uh so quinn miller you are the hilly of the week congratulations uh i love this business so just to summarize buy the thing for a thousand bucks cold call you know um apartment complexes motels hotels you know low income the better i guess is the way that this market works and then you're trying to generate he's generating off of uh what'd you say 50 50 machines 27. 27 off of 27 machines he's generating about 100 to 120k of profit uh a year and so that's you know that's the business and then what's the work uh it sounds like it could be easily you know delegated but sounds like he wants to do it keep his margins which is you go you buy the stuff wholesale and then you stock all the machines on some regular cadence and you collect uh you know the payments on the other side so i was so fascinated so like i get uh when people call me a tech guy i'm like not really i work in publishing like i'm a publisher but i guess compared to someone who works in vending machine i am a tech guy and so i like these like big things software companies that can scale but when i heard him describing this i'm like god i want to get in on this like this is just so like you know what i mean like it's like we just got done talking about paparazzi and how this young guy named nikita who sold an app for a hundred million dollars to facebook and is probably 26 years old baller like dot you'll die a billionaire if you just breathe okay that's it but then i hear the about this guy who spent 50 grand and is gonna make a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year in profit and i'm like yeah sign me up let's get into this so i think it's kind of interesting i like hearing about it yeah whatever floats your boat you know okay let's do some quick like other ideas or other brains so i think first of all i'll say the beauty of this is that you don't need to come up with a genius twist on it you just do the same thing in your local market and it would work okay so that's that's cool but if you were gonna do a twist right like i i like to dabble in ideas so let's let's come up with some ideas here's a couple that i think might be interesting as twisps you mentioned um the honesty market what do you call it honesty market that's what he called it yeah so um i've seen this at big companies they do this um like at the adobe office i remember they did this which is like there's a bunch of sandwiches in a thing you take it out and you pay and nobody's watching you so there's no labor cost and uh they just hope that you're not gonna steal and that works in certain types of like high-end places you said wework things like that okay i think that's cool so maybe there's an out there maybe there's an opportunity there what about subscription so you if you're taking my credit card and you got this vending machine how do you get me with saying hey you could buy this one right now you could buy this one can of coke for a dollar but for uh you know six dollars a week and get unlimited coke or you can get unlimited vending machine swipes and uh and you basically set up a recurring revenue business off of the residents in the in the place and um you know it's like a breakage model so you you know you they just can't empty you out and dude i think that's the move but you're wrong it's not unlimited no no it's capped right but the machine caps you it's like oh hey it's user whatever i don't know how they would know that you're you're you i guess that's a little bit of a tricky one you have to swipe your card every time which feels bad you just need like a metro card you know like a like a like a metro card or exactly you need a clipper card or whatever where you basically get a certain amount so the question is this if someone's gonna if you're gonna spend so when i lived in college i had a vetting machine would i spend 30 a month in that vending machine i think yes i think i did yeah yeah i think i did we had snapples and i couldn't resist right so then the question is you just have to ask yourself are you willing to give up 15 of your revenue in order to give the customer a discount if they pay up front yeah but you know i think it works both ways so you get two benefits one is they prepay so you float all the money that way and you're able to like cash flow the business better the second thing is not everybody's gonna maximize the value so there's like a breakage model where some people use the full amount um great and you know if 30 of people don't max out that's just free money for you that you didn't have to send a dime on and uh easily you know most of i think this is the the ugly side of most subscription businesses is that people don't use the subscription they just don't remember they don't cancel uh they're either too lazy or they forgot and you sit here thinking you have all these happy customers and in reality go look at your usage numbers how happy are they if they haven't used you in a you know a year and a half and you're just charging their card and so that's the truth about subscription businesses why people love them is because the people set it and forget it and uh and so yeah i think the same thing would happen here all right so that's another idea last one i'll bring up with this vending machine thing is i'm buddies with the guy who started life aid he came on the podcast they have yeah i remember that fit aid party aid you know recovery aid whatever sleeping whatever they are they have a bunch of different drinks i'm like addicted to fit aid it's like my whole mini-fridge in my gym here is stocked with them and he got his break by giving he he basically went to crossfit gyms and he said hey crossfit you don't have a mini fridge i will give you a free mini-fridge and a case of fit aid here you go you know here's a 79 mini fridge and a case of fit aid um try it out give it to your people let me know what they think and uh if they like it or if you like it and you guys making a little bit of income off this just give me a call back or you know i'll send you a second case uh next month um and so this is how he grew the brand was through the crossfit um the crossfit gym network and specifically with this idea that they didn't have fridges so they didn't have a vending machine they didn't have a fridge and they couldn't have a vending machine because you can't be crossfit and then sell kitkat bars that doesn't work and but what you could do is you could make the the post-workout machine and you could put it in every gym what's in the post-workout machine it's gatorade propel it's you know fitted it's all all the no no i'm just saying you could do this this is idea um and then you have like you know i mean the bcaas like the branch chain amino acids you should take post-workout as a little supplement you know you could have hydrant for your for your hydration needs so you could put a whole bunch of post-workout stuff that people take protein powders protein pre-mixed drinks you could put it all on a vending machine and put it and put it in gyms i think you could have a similar model yeah i think that could work i would i don't know actually what the margins are on health food versus a coke uh i imagine they're the same to be honest um but i'm into it i think that those honesty market things i bet works shockingly well yeah i remember when we were doing the sushi restaurant we met the guys who started like i don't know panera or something like that and panera bread was doing this actually i think in st louis they opened up the first yeah they're from st louis the first like pay what you want uh restaurant so pay what you can i think is what they called it at the time which is like anybody could go and you could eat and you just pick what you want and at the end it says pay whatever you want the average person pays 12 and uh what he said was that the average ticket price in that restaurant was higher than their normal ticket than their normal uh restaurants where they have fixed prices you would think oh people are going to scam you and cheat you anybody says it's a bell curve 20 of people go over 20 of people go under and most of the people pay the exact same you know but when you look at how the exact numbers break down it's a little bit higher because people eat more and um because they feel like they're getting a deal and the customers were happier because they didn't you know it's like kind of like a feel-good story so i thought that was kind of interesting then again i also when he was talking i was like this sounds a little bit like pr so uh i'm gonna like discount what you're saying by like thirty percent here i might do this for fun do what i might do the vending machine thing i think it's i think it's a great idea i think you should do it as the uh just basically build it in public for the podcast i think you should you should basically give us updates on how the vending machine business is going i think i will i think i'm gonna do it i love it i think this is a fun weekend thing you want to talk about one more thing you want to do uh ghost kitchen for gifting yeah so um so it was my trainer's birthday yesterday or two days ago and i was like uh i want to get him something what do i get him right and so i was like okay i'm not great at buying gifts buying gifts is like a huge pain in the ass i'm a procrastinator so like today is his birthday so i can't like order something online it's not gonna arrive it's gonna clearly be like i ordered this on your birthday it's gonna arrive three days later that's up yeah that's who i am i'm up right like that's just the reality of the situation and so i was like okay well what do i do that what can i do now that will like arrive today and how do i be a good friend who's also a lazy bastard and so my go-to recently has just been i just surprise older people postmates or ubereats stuff like i'll just like i'll just order you know like two jamba juices to somebody's house and they're like uh and i'm just texting them be like hey uh you know there's something for you outside and they're like what and they go and they pick it up or they you know the person rings the doorbell and says hey this is for you um and people love this uh i it happened to me somebody on my birthday instead of giving me a birthday gift they just ordered me food from one of a restaurant that i like and i was like this is fantastic and like sometimes the logistics don't work because you're like not there or whatever like it's not perfect but um these the food ordering apps i think they recognize this because now like recently in all their apps they kind of have like a gift a meal like option but um what it made me think of was oh what's the actual business what's the if this is um [Music] you know what that phrase is where have you ever seen this diagram where there's like a street or like a a walkway where you're walking and it's like a l right like i walk straight then i turn left and then there's like if you cut across you get there faster and you could see in the grass people so many people have cut across it's like worn out it's called like a happy path or something like that like a desire path uh it's basically you show what people actually want to do it's called the desire path and so similarly i think the desire path here is not to randomly order food have to ask your friend for their exact address hope that they're there to receive it so you can't really surprise them but instead why don't people make why doesn't somebody make the version of like edible arrangements or like one of these like gift basket products on top of ubereats and post base and all these companies that we already use so if you're on top of doordash already has my credit card i'm already opening the app every day why doesn't somebody make the best way to just send a gift product to somebody else as a ghost kitchen on top of this i think this is a no-brainer successful idea what does edible arrangements do oh you never had basically it sends like a kind of like a platter or gift basket to somebody yeah yeah yeah yeah i know that in a like um cool format and this business does like hundreds of millions of dollars like it's a very very successful business old school business no i i get that but how do they how do they like how is this any different than you just ordering food for someone so what edible range it looks like a gift like it's a it's like a gift basket and you want to do that for a restaurant no i think somebody should make a ghost kitchen on top of ubereats and doordash that is specifically a way to send food gifts to other people it looks like a gift it's like a giant chocolate thing right interesting it's like a giant fruit fruit arrangement it's a it's just you know hearts and strawberries and chocolate cover strawberries or whatever right like it's stuff like that and it basically and like instead of you know when doordash says customize your order you're like you know i'm allergic to gluten instead of this it's like what's your gift message we have we print it out we put it in there right like the thing you want to be a thoughtful person is like a cool looking thing that looks like a gift and it comes with a little message but i want it as a last minute option and the way to do that is as a ghost kitchen i think so i was talking to andrew this last podcast and then i talked to him afterwards i called him i go hey what were you talking about was pretty interesting tell me more so he started this uh uh a bakery bakery basically andrew is being andrew he's always tinkering and uh he was like i want low carb like something to satisfy me like bread right and so he he uses this thing called sucrose i think some monk fruit some alternative sweetener right and he got the guy to he hired a chef and he paid him a small amount of money single digit low hundreds of dollars to come to his house for a few hours and make these recipes single digits love hundreds of dollars what does that mean like i don't like two three dollars no like uh single day as in not like 800 or i guess that yeah okay right now you've got a few hundred bucks gotcha yeah a few hundred dollars to come and make a bunch of muffins i think is what he made okay and he had him use this monk fruit thing he goes this is sick and he designed a website called uh i forget what it was called something like i forget he made a little website on shopify for the brand and then he put it on a doordash or uber eats and he sent it to a bunch of friends and he only did local delivery in victoria and he had the the meal delivery company dude he sold like three grand in month one worth of stuff and he's like invested eight thousand dollars into it so didn't make a profit but it kind of sit he was able to test this idea very easily and he's i'm like man of all the stuff that you do this like agency that which makes more way more money this bakery thing is so much more fascinating than like just you know doing a design design work for someone this is way neater to me right and anyway so i think you could test this so easily yeah totally because you could just rent out a commissary kitchen for the hour right you don't even have to commit to very long right so you can rent these things by the hour so you can rent it for a couple weeks a few hundred bucks maybe maybe a thousand dollars max you list your your restaurant on uh your fiverr or logo you list your your ghost kitchen on on doordash or ubereats you pick one city and you start and if this works you basically just you become the easiest way for people in that city to send a thoughtful little gift to others the key is you don't have to spend the money acquiring customers right so like you could have always done this business but you would be competing against you know 1-800 flowers and edible arrangements and i forgot what the other ones like david something we send like chocolate like i did this for my neighbor my neighbor lets us use their playground with my kid and so i sent them like a big like chocolate gift basket or something like that because i don't know i need to do something nice and i don't want to make anything so like you know how do i spend 100 and give a thoughtful nice gift to somebody make them happy for for five minutes and uh so i did the same so that's what i want to do but i don't want to have to go google search and figure out the brand and then like go through their website input my credit card no i already open doordash six times a week it should just be there my credit card's saved i push the button and it goes to the person and it's it's done what's your grocery bill every month is do groceries are insane i don't know if i'm insane or if inflation has happened but i went to the grocery store no joke last two times went to the grocery store it's 450 to 500 for me my wife and i have a like you know i have a baby who drinks breast milk because i don't even that doesn't even count and then we have like a you know 20 month old so you go to whole foods it's whole foods but like whole foods you didn't it wasn't a 500 trip for me before it was like a 200 trip so i think we got like a little crazy being like yeah let's buy these like nine dollar juices or something like that i don't know what's happening but that's crazy what's yours uh i would have to look but i imagine it would be between one thousand to fifteen hundred dollars a month one thousand okay so that's like 400 a week so about the same yeah but my thing is even before i had anything i would always spend a lot on it because my logic was what's the point of living if you don't feel good and so i'm gonna buy the highest quality stuff i know i don't care about price yeah my logic was i want this uh i really want to eat this right now look like when it comes to books i don't care what the price is same and i don't even care if i read it if i just get one sentence yeah it could change my life forever so i don't care like there was one time i saw this book and it was eighty dollars i'm like oh my god i'm like nope i don't care i'm buying it um mostly it's the same thing with groceries so like the healthiest uh freshest stuff that like like for example i used to buy like kroger that's like the grocery store in nashville like kroger generic cheese and like if i thought about that now i'm like oh i can't even think about eating that right now well do you do the thing where you're like you look at your parents and you're like yo what were you thinking like yeah cheese in a can and like yeah this was like everything yeah every thursday we used to eat like you know like um like totino's uh you know pizza rolls and like takadis or whatever those things are like or like yogurt [Laughter] yeah same exact thing that was the regular food we ate that wasn't like the one-off thing if you asked my mom what a carb is i don't think she could still tell you so like i just this is good it has carbs i'm like no mom see that's the problem you know this has carbs and you're like yeah pasta that's a good hearty meal i'm like no no no no mom that's like because she's still like you know but i can't even blame her dude the food pyramid the food pyramid how big of a lie was that that was like a middle finger to america the bottom of the food pyramid is like get your grains and your carbs and cereals and pastas and breads and then like vegetables has this small little half slice on the third layer like fruits and vegetables just got like you know shoved in last minute right right next to dessert it's crazy yeah like if you how many grams of sugar are in a can of coke ballpark you know i think it's like 30 40 grams yeah it's great so you that's the ball part yeah so i think it's like a little bit more than 40. if you ask my family like growing up how many grams are they're like i have no a million i don't know like what is the what is it what's the gram yeah like i don't know and also like if i told them 45 they'd be like i don't is that right 45 like is that good like we're not we're not 100 sounds good to me they wouldn't know um so i think that there's something here about uh like growing up i i middle school i used to eat the school lunch in texas i grew up in houston texas in middle school and this is my first time where like mom stopped packing my lunch and i started to buy the school lunch six six seventh grade and straight up every single day i ate a frito pie which is by the way that's not even like a meal like you can't go to a restaurant and order a frito pie because all it is is it's a bag of fritos emptied into a basket and then chili and cheese put on it like nachos i ate that every day it tastes amazing by the way but i ate that every single day as a kid and my parents where was the intervention that's what i want to know where was the intervention that that should not have happened i definitely think it's changing now i don't think it's changed entirely at all but i think it has yeah jamie oliver died for this man he tried to change the schools or whatever yeah the naked chef um so yeah so when it comes to like budgeting i for food i just whatever because like i'm putting this in my body okay i need it to be like the best stuff so um but i did just drink like a diet dr pepper yeah i was gonna say pretty sure i've seen you just like just house like a whole halloween that's a small child's like halloween hall i do a podcast one time it is it is a huge weakness of mine but uh whatever i i mostly do good uh we will i'll have to do an update so i've been i'll i'll say it now i've been taking trt now for about a year yeah and both sean and i invested in this trt company called peak it's switching its name now but it's switching its name um and i'll like do an update on it but basically like i took it not to change my body i took it because uh like i was feeling down and i got tested and they're like oh your t's real low it has made me jacked like totally jacked like i i feel like i'm still feeling down but dude so we're gonna have to do an update on this and i like i told these guys i was like you know like i don't know if i want to post a shirtless pic but i might be open to it if you want to do like a like a because they're appealing to like nerds right and i'm like i'm that if you but i look like a kind of a shredded nerd right now maybe i could be like your you want me to post a pic like a before and after i will but uh oh my god this trt stuff i feel amazing that is crazy so you were taking this before but you switched peak is that what you did i took it for a little while and then i got off of it when i got uh when i got lime i cuz i couldn't get like a refill something like that and then i got like and then i'm back on it again now um and i and i started using peak pretty cool service i'm not telling anyone to take this by the way don't i mean just like this is like some doctor yeah but it's pretty awesome yeah if don't come to our podcast for either financial or medical advice to be honest yeah but just say what we do and what works for us that doesn't mean it's gonna work for anybody else no no promises for anybody i'm eating whole foods and i'm shooting up with trt and like your body's transforming my body is completely transformed in the last six months um i'm just like crazy strong i have pretty low body fat like 15 which isn't that low but pretty low and i just feel like a professional athlete so it's pretty awesome that's amazing congratulations i think now we know what to do with the live show you just need to take off your shirt i think that's going to be your contribution and then i'll prepare some content well i sent you a pic and someone was like you look like a white ape you're like yeah you do you look like a gorilla you look like uh you were like you looked like stunning like when you wear your shirt like right now if somebody's watching on our youtube channel which you should youtube.com hustlecon i think is it yeah um if they see you right now they're gonna be like like i'm not meaning this as an insult but you just look like an average person right now yes you sent me that picture and you looked like my bodyguard like you looked you looked like somebody i would hire to protect me which was insane yeah it was crazy so anyway we'll do an update about that my birthday's coming up in june and i thought about maybe i'll post a shirtless pic just like why aren't you um why don't you wear shirts that make you look more jacked you wear stuff that like makes you look non-jacked are you trying to do some clark kent superman i don't know it's not intentional i it's not intentional i don't think about it [Laughter] so we um meandered a bit we'll see if this turns out to be any good no dude that was great the vending machine stuff alone was the price of entry i think people will you know go check out paparazzi vimeo that was okay uh and then the ghost kitchens for gifting i think is like a cool idea but nobody's gonna go do that but i think the vending machine thing was the star of the show today what do you think abreu or should we ask dan because abreu you know handing off the baton to dan so let's start with dan and then let's go to a brayu let's go for the apprentice and then the master all right i liked the paparazzi i i like the vimeo um the vending machines i don't know i looked at that when i was in high school actually oh damn the contrarian i love it yeah and then the ghost kitchens i don't know you guys use doordash and stuff maybe i'm just too old i don't use that stuff yeah i feel like that's one thing that i'm always like yeah everybody uses doordash six times a week i'm like oh wait probably probably not probably most people don't but that way people wait dan you don't use door dabs or you don't i like to cook yeah but what do you do when you don't want to do it we go out to eat or i'll pick something up i don't think like you like to cook all the time yeah he's like i like to cook it's like dude but you eat what do you do for the other 18 times i've been intermitting faster i also like because yeah i also like to have that in common yeah i did i cooked too last month i don't think it's even i don't think it's even an older person thing like it's just expensive you're just paying so much for the delivery yeah but like what do you do when it's like when you're hungry when i have an eight-figure access i i guess yeah you cook every meal yeah just about but i also eat like chicken nuggets for lunch so yeah yeah okay so give me give me give me yesterday's menu what did you eat breakfast lunch yesterday and snack yesterday um i'll start with dinner it was mashed potato kielbasa frozen veggies um toasted hawaiian uh hawaiian bread whatever it's called um lunch is always the same thing it's uh carrots and chicken nuggets every single day so i feed my dog yeah and then morning it's just like coffee okay what's kielbasa that's like a it's like a sausage yeah yeah polo sausage with hawaiian bread and what um mashed potatoes frozen veggies dude so you're not on the whole foods tip dude that's yeah you're eating like my mom my mom top you're eating like my mom taught me to eat you're starting a company up right it's like at least go in the whole foods scholarship and eat and you gotta like when you're on the whole food scholarship you gotta you fill the plate with the hot food and then you take a cart and you walk around while you're eating it and then you just and then you just try that um you can pay him back when you're done okay but like that's that's crazy to me damn what do you eat i feel like now i get now i feel like an is this what i'm supposed to be doing and i'm supposed to be eating kielbasa for dinner what what i have a little uh instant pot spice pack business so make an instant pot meal a few times a week so i got some damn coming in hot with the plug what is it what's the business bonniespices.comispices.com so you put spices into the spots and then what you put just like chicken in there yeah so the biggest thing i thought was the challenge with the instant pot was measuring out all the spices if you wanted to make something so i had a butter chicken recipe took two minutes to do everything but the spices so we sell a pack that's compostable it has the recipe has all the spices you just open it up dump it in makes using an instant pot much easier that's not a bad idea okay what's uh how's the business doing i kind of went on hold when covet hits so i'm spinning it back up why would it go on hold for kobe like you had to go on hold yeah i ended up losing all my clients i was doing consulting for events and that kind of disappeared i see i see okay gotcha and so you uh you pause the business okay but are we talking are we in the tens of dollars hundreds of dollars thousands of dollars tens of tens of thousands like the hundreds of dollars a month so okay all right so everybody go to any spices order something let's get them into the thousands of dollars uh i'll get one what's your best one is butter chicken rice butter chicken i have a little indian three pack we have a rogan josh an indian curry lentils and a butter chicken if i take off my shirt i also have a little indium that's my nickname for sean i mean that was easy you just yeah thank you for the assistance uh dan what's the url a n i spices dot com a and i spices dot com yep all right and dan uh so abreu grades us at the end of every episode what'd you give this one i thought the vending machine thing was worth it that made it an a minus everything else was a so in the a's thanks the vending machine and then dan are you uh are you more simon cowell are you harsh or are you paula abdul you just give everybody a's what's your what's your grading style uh let's do this one as a b plus i feel like there's a bray who's literally has never given us a b it's only an a it's a a minus or a dude it only used to be b's you guys started actually doing some work and you got some a's all right fair enough all right good stuff let's uh let's let's leave all this in this is fine um people can people can enjoy this so all right we're out of here see you in austin see you in miami i bought my tickets this morning i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
i want to create a company and i want to sell it for 100 million plus to walmart or amazon in three years what opportunities exist in the e-com world or in the commerce world that amazon or walmart would buy my company because they desperately need something that i'm selling or some type of solution that i've created would you like him to do anything else for you sam the most specific question no that's actually not that specific i feel like i can rule the world i know all right today we have mark laurie on the podcast this guy is an og of e-commerce he sold diapers.com to amazon for like i don't know 600 million dollars he created jet.com and sold it to walmart for three and a half billion dollars good guy he came on and uh me and sam were pretty blown away like we kind of little fanboys of his right now so so we enjoyed the episode he had a bunch of good ideas he talked about how to go raise a bunch of money to go after a big vision he had some ideas in health care sam asked him a great question like if i wanted to start a company today then i could sell for 100 million dollars to amazon or walmart what product would you recommend i start and he had a fantastic answer so he had ideas at the at the end and at the beginning he talked a little bit about his kind of approach to why he bought the minnesota timberwolves and how he's going to run the team how he builds his team how he hires people stuff like that so the beginning is more philosophy the end is ideas and he also had a great a great answer i asked someone like when you bought the the basketball team did you just like send a huge wire um like just hearing those details are really interesting but we do a whole long debrief at the end of this episode which you might even find more interesting the actual episode because it's always fun to like discuss uh like i always find the recap to be one of the most exciting so give it a listen yeah but he was great i think you're gonna love it and we liked him so much we want him to come back on one hour was not enough and here's what we ask you to do um listen to the episode if you're liking it he said he's big on linkedin so go to his linkedin his name is mark laurie last name is l-o-r-e um and just go pop comment on one of his linkedin posts and just say hey if i like if you like the episode just tell them love the episode um come back on and i think if he gets enough messages we will be able to bring him back on and go deeper on a bunch of ideas that we didn't get to do today all right here's the episode enjoy um okay cool so we have a guest here sam do you wanna you wanna team up who's who is on the line yes so e-commerce tycoon successful billionaire and as of 2017 is exceptionally jacked in bulb mark i have to ask you which of these is your favorite part of jeff bezos [Laughter] sam's been polishing that one up for the last hour no uh mark lori we have um mark you've done a lot of stuff you've started four different things right four different startups that have uh successfully exited the most popular one is probably a few more that are in stealth that i'm really excited about maybe i can share a little bit about but yeah we want to we want to learn all about it but the biggest one was um jet.com that's one probably everyone knows uh before that you did diapers.com which you sold to amazon for 550 million bucks ish that one might have been bigger because that was sold to amazon very early and amazon appreciated a lot since then so maybe that one i don't know you tell us which one is which one ends up bigger is it the early the early one or jet i think no jet definitely i mean stock doubled uh over the last four and a half years so that was that was a good one i gotta thank you for that when they bought you um i bought the stock because i was like yeah there's plenty of room to run here for walmart e-commerce and uh yeah i feel like i was a part of the company i won a little bit as well just off the news and you um and then you also sold a company called the pit uh which is called the tops that was like for 5.7 right back in the day in the day and uh you prior to that you were you worked in banking but then before that you were a runner so i was a runner i ran the 200 meter and 400 meter what was your uh well i ran uh uh high 21's in the 200 and uh 448 for the 400. same with me almost exactly the same yeah high 21s high 48s exactly yeah i got slower as the distance but longer and 400 was was sort of long i was better at sort of the 60 yard and and uh and 100 and 200 but yeah what was her 100 meter pr uh 1074. wow and was that fat did they do 74 yeah wow well that's pretty you're moving i didn't have the endurance to keep it up you know in the in the two and the four but yeah so so you've done a lot of stuff um you've done you've done a ton of research you've done you've done a ton of stuff in the past but even the stuff you're doing now is also interesting you just you guys made a bid for the timberwolves right yeah we actually it went through so we signed an agreement so yeah we're just going through the nba approval process now and then hope to close like probably in like six weeks was that a um a dream like you know i've had this dream as a kid you know own an nba team that's that's the point of doing business you know as a really small kid it was like play professional sports of course that's where you start every kid you eventually realize okay it's not going to be that sport it's not going to be this first you know and then i was like oh maybe you know uh it would be uh decathlete you know and go to the olympics and i was like okay that's not going to happen i'm like all right forget it you know what i'm just gonna like one day own a team that's what i'll do that's amazing that was the dream you know i was a huge sports fan growing up followed every sport watched every game you know it was a huge knicks fan and then you know i had two kids and you know life happens and you sort of get a little bit detached from sports but i love it i'm excited to like dive back in and have a reason it's it seems like back in it seems like i don't know 10 15 years ago the sports team thing was like you've made it this is your it's like buying a car right it's like i buy my toy i always wanted this toy this is kind of like lifelong dream and i think it's obviously still like kind of a passion thing but also the business merits of buying a team as an investment has actually become a pretty big deal because these franchises have appreciated like crazy because there's only whatever there's only 30 of them and there's sort of more billionaires and there are teams so give me a pie chart is this what percentage of this was just i just want to have it it's like art versus this is actually a good business position how do you think about that yeah it's probably 80 the former 20 good investment like yeah it's it's not so much about being a great investment just not going to lose money i'm going to have a lot of fun anytime you can have a lot of fun and not lose money like i love going to the horse track you have a lot of fun but you also a lot of money i kind of like this you know where it's it's uh have a lot of fun and maybe make a little bit of money too it's like perfect but i'm excited about you know just innovating using i think there's a lack of like real innovation in sports in general like applying sort of a technology mindset like how do you bring augmented reality to the entertainment experience how do you move to like dynamic announcing so you can choose your announcer dynamic real-time ticketing i want people to move to any open seat in the stadium at any time like i've got all these like tech ideas on how to augment the experience and it's just fun to have a platform to be able to you know buy these things and try and and even you know what's the moneyball version of of in basketball too you know like as a mid-market team how do you win what's the strategy thinking that through uh how do you uh apply the same techniques of vision capital people like what's the what's the mission what are the values what do you stand for how do you show up every day how do you live those values like treat it like a like a real startup and and to date you know i've talked to a lot of people it doesn't really seem like anybody's sort of gotten gone down that path yet and are you just gonna run this like a company i mean like because you're incredibly successful at running companies but you don't i mean you know a bit about sports i imagine but like this is like a total this is totally outside of everything that you've done you've done e-commerce i i love the challenge because every business that i get into i don't know anything about it when i start i didn't know anything about retail and i did diverse.com you know i i didn't know anything about the pit when i started that i started a bunch of startups recently i don't know anything about that i'm starting and building the city i'm doing a reality tv show i'm doing these things and you know it comes down to vision capital people it's you have to have the vision and you just think about it share it with people like a piece of clay you keep molding the vision molding like wow this is a big vision everyone agrees this is freaking huge okay great how are we going to capitalize it great that's what i do raise money i have lots of connections with investors that raised over a billion dollars so like okay we're gonna capitalize it and then the third part is the most important and the hardest to get right is people the p part and it's finding a great ceo and a great executive leadership team setting the values setting the mission the corporate culture getting the org structure right getting the right people in the right spots and creating a culture where you get the very best out of each person that you bring in then you kind of just sit back then you're there as a strategic advisor i think if you're trying to sit you know micromanage and make decisions um when you don't have the experience that's where you get in trouble you know so if i were to come into the team and say you know i think you should draft so and so and you know why are we doing this and we should be playing you know this and that's not going to work i just don't i think who is the very best you know uh person in the world to you know run this part of the business to run that part of the business to be the chief people officer to bring in the very best talent and create a great culture who are the best people in the world and get them in the right spots in the right positions if the vision is right and everybody's clear exactly where you're going what what the the north star is and you've got great people and they're happy and they're empowered great things will happen and that allows me to do multiple things at the same time now because you know i'm not getting into the weeds of it a lot of your companies um how much do you guys raise at diapers.com diapers raised 55 million okay so that's a lot but not close to i mean jet was what like a bill i mean you guys raised uh yeah like 800 million so substantially larger although though both are quite large this idea of being able to hire the best in the world and being able to hide people hire people to do to to do a lot of the work that they specialize in could you have done that if you were bootstrapping your companies no i mean that that's why you know we started alex and i um hey rod just started a venture fund called vcp vision capital people we believe that there's a really big hole in the market for people with big visionary ideas to get a big infusion of capital early like when they have nothing so they can go out and hire the very best team in the world i think a lot of startups it's a little bit of chicken and egg how do you get the capital unless you have the team you can't hire the team until they have the capital but you don't get enough capital until you prove it and so you get a million bucks and then you get five million bucks then you get 10 million bucks and each step of the way you're sort of on a tight wire type right you know you you're basically like one little thing goes wrong so the investors lose confidence where you under uh over promise and under deliver lots of things go wrong we basically say no vision capital people you have a big vision we know this could be a really big idea we know somebody's going to do this at the right time to do it let's not under capitalize it here's 10 million seed go out and hire the best team in the world that puts you in a position to have the best shot of a really successful business if you got the best people you got the capital and you have the vision right you're a player now you're kind of like worst case you're going to exit this somebody's going to pick it up because you've got great people and it's the right time it's a big vision so what do you what do you think when so there's there's the case where jet where that clearly is what happened and it worked and then you see like quibby or something like that raised you know clearly successful people at the start raised a bunch of money raised a billion dollars or so more than that i think uh big vision hey we're gonna you know rethink netflix for mobile and didn't quite hit it and they're burning a lot of money so even though they raised a lot their burn still left them with i don't know how many you know the same sort of time you know two years of runway or whatever it was that like a normal startup has so how do you think about that do you think it's hey look it's just a numbers game it doesn't always work out or do you think there's something different in the strategy that maybe they could have done or you've done differently that that leads to better results yeah um i don't know that intimately do you know the story and i do think that's probably more the exception than the rule i mean i think listen startups don't all work so some of them are work do i think it had a higher probability of working because it was a big vision they had a lot of capital great people yeah i think it i think it does specifically why it didn't work the only thing from the outside looking in was were the the most talented people in the organization fully committed an all-in to it that's the only that's the only thing i wonder i don't know um obviously you had really talented people but were they dedicating their their life to it you need somebody in these businesses that's sort of like i'm running this business and dedicating my life to it it doesn't have to be necessarily the person that's doing the vcp at the top but who is that person and and and you know do you have the the right team to support so i don't know the end of that that's where i'd probably wonder and so me and sam talk about this a lot because uh you know we think about art what's next for us we got got some money in the bank we got time we got you know we got all these dreams about what we might want to do and one of the paths is similar to you where you as an entrepreneur you sort of can see these opportunities and you could be you can be the spark that helps start them but you're not necessarily going to be the day-to-day operator in the weeds maybe like you were with your first startup right and um and some people like you seem to be pretty successful with this model and it seems like it's dependent on those three things you talked about having the right vision shaping that first getting the capital in and then recruiting the right people on the people part take us into a job interview with you so um obviously there's the standard stuff you know you ask what they've done i've hired i've tried to calculate it but over a thousand people right that personally like you know interviewed in my career and i've honed uh over the years and it's changed my thinking has changed on hiring people resumes and i've i've gone from you know early in my career when i first started you know i just want to feel like i want to have a beer with this person right i realize how wrong that is and people make that mistake today and at least to all kinds of unconscious buyers and things like that it's the worst possible thing to do i spend an incredible amount of time up front on resume reading which i never used to do before used to be like hey this person's great oh they they were a cfo i'm looking for a cfo you say they're great come on interview them i i don't listen to what people tell me necessarily about people because there's always somebody out there that'll say something good about everybody and so i kind of just discount that for the most part there might be a select couple people that i really trusted like you work with this person trust me they're they're top five percent okay but that'll show on the resume and so when i look at the resume like i'm looking for a demonstrable level of success in whatever they do so i'm think i get into their mind i start at the beginning when they graduate school and it doesn't matter what school they go to but but they graduate they go into into a company um if if they're there for a few years did they get promoted like what did the trajectory look like and then the most important part when they leave that company and go to a new company is it something that a top five percenter would do top five percent is move in a certain way that you start to learn machine learning these these uh you know trends um and top five percenters top ten percentage of the elite people when they move they move in step fashion it'll be a bigger title much bigger role or a better company and they'll get in that company and they will be promoted multiple times and then they'll leave it'll be another step change and so i'm looking for that like multi-company movement within the company and big step changes any kind of any kind of deviation to that i don't i just don't even won't even interview so a lateral move out right you know move from uh uh a google to kmart sorry kmart but out like i just i anything any little like tap that says not top five percent and somebody could say hey but that's not fair like i'm actually good or this person's great i'm like you know what i'm not going to interview because you know what there's a chance i get honey potted right honey potted everyone's everyone experienced this you basically bring somebody in for an interview the resume is maybe not ideal they come in you spend one hour with them and you just really like them and they throw some buzzwords around they've gotten old experience and you're like hired think about that i mean you're committing to like hire somebody and keep them in your company hopefully for years to be an important part of the company and like you have an hour with them maybe you have multiple people spend an hour but still a pretty small amount of time and so i don't let myself get honey potted i've been hunting potted many times in the past and i unless that resume screams superstar which again it's only five out of a hundred resumes if you say top five percent or ten out of ten one out of ten and be really like say no no no it's hard because you're tempted like oh they have good experience this person whatever no so when i interview someone i know that they're a superstar on the resume and so i can focus primarily on core values and they're spotted traits so spotic is an acronym i come up with for traits i look for in people i hire smart passionate optimistic tenacious adaptable kind and empathetic and the last two are really important kind in kindness and empathy i found over the years that you can get somebody that's super tenacious passion they'll run through a brick wall but also run through people over people and they're not you find somebody that has the passion they're optimistic and tenacious and adaptable because you need that in startup but at the same time they're very kind and empathetic and you get that person that's able to balance that that's magic and so those are the things and the interview questions have nothing to do i want to ask one traditional interview question they'll all be questions to open them up to to try to get at what makes them tick and do they exhibit these traits and you know i have this theory like uh i've now if you work in tech you meet so many smart people that smart becomes kind of like table stakes great yeah everybody's super intelligent well now what and and clearly smart isn't just the only thing that that leads to success you need a whole bunch of other things that you mentioned and um i sort of found like what's in rare supply so which of those traits is in most rare supply i'll give you my kind of opinion which is i found that two really simple ones tend to be to me the lowest in supply and uh and have a pretty outsized impact in startups and those two are uh energy or like enthusiasm i think bringing energy to the table every day is quite contagious and you need it at the beginning when you're starting something from scratch and so it seems like one of these anyone can do it yeah anyone can do it but most people don't and the other one is courage so the courage to either build something new uh say say something that's on your mind um to like not let you know something that's below our standards go uh courage i feel is in an extremely short supply take risk too right i call it boldness we call it bull at our company but yeah do you feel like when you meet people is there something you're just like ah i wish more people had x what is x for you that you feel like is in short supply you know i mean what you said there so when i say you know passionate and optimism i think um optimism isn't you know uh the sort of the optimism that allows you to be bold and take risk and it's that optimism that you believe not only great things can happen um but also believe that people are good like your starting place is that it's just an optimistic view of the world i think that's really important and it allows you to trust which is one of the core values in in in in all my companies i think trust is really important if you want to create a culture where the company trusts the employees the employers trust the company that's really important to create an environment where people are happy and feel empowered and they feel a sense of ownership trust is so i have this idea that you know a lot of people say oh trust of course trust but verify and i don't believe in the but verify right i think you start out trusting people um and until they prove otherwise and it's very risky because you can get burned but i've seen the power of the upside of trusting somebody before they've necessarily proven that they deserve it it's incredibly powerful motivator and i've seen it in my personal life i've seen it in business people want to they want to run through a wall for you when you're like wait you trust me but you can i can burn you i can yeah but i trust you are you going to burn me of course not you know you're trusting me i'm not going to burn you that is an incredible value that i've learned it's it's trust transparency being really open with your employees not hiding not secretive here's the cap table here's the rounds of financing here's the numbers here's all the information you need this i'm an open book what do you want to know like there's no secrets here you right work this company you're an owner you have stock options trust transparency and the other one is fairness that it's really important that people feel in order to create an inclusive a diverse workforce you have to create a safe work environment where people feel safe coming to work they have to feel like it's fair there should never be this feeling of like that's not fair that's why i have a open comp system where everybody knows what everybody else is making and everybody at the same level makes the same amount of money so women minorities everybody makes the same there's no like this idea that maybe it's not fair my colleague why is my colleague that i do the same job why are they making more money than me that sort of thing which is usually a big reason why people lose trust and they don't feel like giving you everything they've got and so i kind of take that off the table so those are the three primary values so you have the values of the organization how they live them and then the traits that you look for in people you hire and when you kind of get that right i think it's it's a magical thing where did this where did this confidence come from because like having the confidence to hire the top five percent is a pretty big deal his high school track days sam yeah what place your confidence comes from it's actually just trial and error failing a lot early on it's it's you know you know well just somebody i want to have a beer with it's making those mistakes it's getting honey potted it's uh you know hiring a person and having go through the pain of having to let them go and replace them like it's so many lessons i i i make so many less mistakes now that i did earlier in my career because i you know i see everyone makes the same mistakes that's why i like to talk about it because it's like it is the same mistakes and people say yeah you know i guess you're right like there was you know the resume kind of did but i was kind of like well the person said they were good i liked them and so i hired them um you have to be really um you know like extremely focused and uh selective in in that the other thing by the way it does help with unconscious bias too if you're you know inclined um when you go through the resume and you bring them in and it's not about whether i like the person you know you they've already like you know that they're they're rock solid and you really can focus on on spotic and sort of help there so i i wanna i wanna ask you about i mean i think we gotta we should ask you about ideas but but before we get to that i wanted to ask one quick question so you left banking in 96 right uh no it was 99. okay what and then i'm looking at some information here on on your timeline you started this thing called the pit the pit was a well it was it was in the internet marketing yeah it was basically a sports stock market we used uh to avoid gambling you know we used baseball card as the proxy for the athlete but essentially it was meant to be a sort of sport stock market where you buy and sell players like stock and you sold that for like six million dollars yeah that was right after the the whole nasdaq crashed in 2000. if you guys remember like went down like i don't know 80 or something and uh yeah there was no way to raise any venture money and we only started it maybe 10 months earlier and we're able we raised 5 million and sold it for 5.7 and everyone's like yeah do it this is a great exit and we're like okay well then we'll do it again let's that's great we'll sell this and get the next idea that's what i was going to ask you is how you could sell for six million bucks after such a short amount of time but i guess the answer is well because you you raised a fair bit at least for a six million dollar experience just i think it was just you know the tops at the time was interested in in the people that we hired we hired a great team we had a we had a vision for what we wanted um and they were there to provide some capital so yeah so let's talk about some ideas that you would need optimism about now right so uh so i think we could talk about jet for example like take some courage and optimism to to go after that prize and basically compete with the the the empire of amazon so but we'll come back to that i want to start with where do you need to be optimistic today what are you optimistic about what ideas are i know you've talked about startup cities i don't know if that's the one you want to talk about or if you have some others but let's shoot us some ideas of what you think is exciting that you're optimistic about that maybe the whole world isn't you know it's not not proven yet i mean i gravitate toward tend to gravitate more towards b2c businesses business to consumer i just like consumer businesses and i think it's easier to understand some of those businesses than sort of more like uh you know if you were like a biomedical company or something like that it's harder to wrap arms around i think there's more so most of the ideas and things in thinking i do is in the b2c world across lots of different industries i've made a number of investments uh and i'm involved with a few companies i'm really excited about um one is archer which is the basically they're like passenger drones so i think i think it's like basically an autonomous uh electric helicopter um that basically flies passengers you know around it's it's safer than hell is this a spec that you did yeah yeah it did us back a couple months ago and um going through the sec process now that's crazy super exciting that was a great vcp um so the the two founders you know came over it actually sit on the couch right here and they said we got this vision for these flying cars these these drones that carry passengers it's the right time this is why it's the right time mark this is how big the industry's going to be this is why it's going to work this is why the technology is right and i was really taken by the vision i thought they had it nailed um and they said hey we need 5 million now we're going to hire the best engineers in the world we're going to take them from the best companies we're going to go raise 50 million and build the state of the art the latest and greatest of these of these aircraft and i thought the two founders were exceptional so great start to the to the founding to the p part of the vcp and i thought okay i'll give them the 5 million and i'll help them you know hire this this team and i'll help them raise the 50. and then you're on your own right that's what we did i put five in we helped raise you know helped hire the the engineering talent helped them raise 50 million and that was two years ago and then they just raised a billion through the spac and so now it's a 4 billion 3.7 billion market cap or something and it was really an idea on this couch two years ago but it shows you what i was saying before about rather than going through this process of like seed can't hire the great team the chicken and egg thing it's like here's five and then let's get the team and simultaneously go and raise 50. so right very short order they had 55 million dollars and they had the best team and i do think they've built the the very best aircraft in the industry right now and they're on their way like it's a massive tam um and so i'm looking at opportunities like that um and i can tell you some other ones too yeah i go yeah yeah well another one that was in the news is is basically mobile kitchens so looking at the trends in food delivery and millennials and gen z not wanting to cook and one food delivered and things you know i just saw that you know it sort of takes a long time to get it delivered inconsistent the quality suffers in transit and it's expensive and i thought oh if you can solve those three things um and how do you do it well what if you cooked in a mobile kitchen if the restaurant basically came to you and it cooked in your driveway hot much faster because the trucks already on the road and so they're they're likely just minutes away and uh and so i made a pretty big bet uh on that company and uh you know it's still in stealth mode but i'm really excited about it i think how how's that different than a food truck so so it's a mobile kitchen but it's for multiple types of food or each mobile kitchen is a different restaurant different cuisine okay um and uh the idea is to is to get the best restaurant of that cuisine in the country and sort of bring it to a central central place you know it's high quality food that's piping hot that's you know delivered to your door fast that that's an exciting i think a big tam big market food that's where the puck's going um i think there's there's uh lots of things lots happening now with uh laws changing in sports gambling and things i think there's really big opportunities there to maybe bring back some of what i did before um what what what was that exactly what you said you talked about the pit yeah you said bringing it back before no just in in new now with the gambling laws changing things i think it's an opportunity to create a true sport stock market and do it right like where it really feels like you're buying and selling players like stock um by by leveraging some of the changes in gambling laws have you seen uh something i mean sean was really into this big cloud have you did you see that no i didn't you don't know what big cloud is oh my gosh uh john you want to explain i mean it's pretty much what it's kind of what you're describing um what they did was they basically took twitter and they turned it into a social network where you don't just follow the person you can invest in them so the cool thing about this was what they did was let's say on twitter i have like i don't know 140 000 followers so from day one what they did is they took the top 10 000 twitter accounts and they had raised i think 150 million dollars from vcs here in silicon valley and they used it to basically pre-buy and invest in all those accounts so on day one when i walked in they said hey if you sign up for big cloud if you claim your account and verify it uh like basically meaning you tweet out that hey this is my big clout i walked into like 75k uh worth of my own coin right worth of my own stock and others were already buying it because they were saying hey if sean joins we think that he might you know continue to grow his following and so we want to invest so the idea being we've all had this experience where you discover a band early or an athlete early or a content creator online a blog and if you see them before they're huge but you really like their stuff you can buy their coin it's like every single person gets their own little little little bitcoin basically and um and then as they get as more people buy it yours appreciates so as a curator as a fan you get to sort of go along for the ride along with the star themselves ultimately because i think that's the key a lot of these things fall down in the end so they don't have a ton of intrinsic value they don't have a ton of interesting value the one thing that it does have is now as the creator so i have all these shareholders right that own my coin some people own tens of thousands of people and a thousand people 100 bucks in my coin i can then basically reward my shareholders so in you know in the stock market you give out a dividend or um you know that you you can reward your shareholders and this i could do the same so i could say i could do it literally a dividend i could say hey for whatever i earned this month my shareholders are gonna uh you know get get their proportionate share i could also say hey we're gonna do a version of this podcast um that only my shareholders get to listen to right like like only fans or or these different products that sort of say if you if you're a subscriber of mine then you get the content so you can kind of pay wall of the content dynamic membership almost like a membership i can come up with whatever the perks are for my members and so then the creators all jockey to offer better value to their holders because their stock appreciates the more incentive incentivizing they make it now this is a one in a hundred hundred a thousand idea but i do think there's something interesting i think there's something interesting yeah it certainly sounds interesting i i tend to shy away from things where i don't see like the the the 20-year 30-year like the intrinsic value like how it ultimately this could be a great exit and yeah like i think with gambling uh laws changing there's a way to give players intrinsic value so you basically basically say at the end of somebody's career i'm gonna pay you based on their career stats x like and so you know this rookie comes up you know like it has real value because the the exchange the stock market is giving it intrinsic value by giving you a predetermined amount of money based on certain stats over the career like that kind of that that's interesting so you so you could say um so the house basically sets the line right uh let's say zion comes into the league and we say okay the house believes the zion you know the market the line gets set that zion's gonna be a hall of fame player and maybe that means x y and z stats this mvp's this many points whatever it is do you think it's better than that right you buy if you think if you think that's not going to happen you don't buy are you short and basically the careers so you get to predict the player's uh journey and then the better than it's like a super fan basically as the better they perform you feel like you're being vindicated and you're actually going to economically benefit from having identified somebody who's going to perform higher than what the market thinks that's cool yeah exactly what um i i think i read somewhere that you like to look at google trends a lot like you're you're and and because you're a serial entrepreneur you invest in a lot of stuff you're always looking for trends you're always looking for what's popular what i want to know is what what do you use like what signals do you look for to figure out where you're going to go to and also what signal told you that jet was interesting because a lot of people probably said don't even think about doing this like you're you know you're i imagine a lot of people are like amazon or walmart or someone already owns the space what are you crazy this is like an impossible feat yeah no it's two different things i mean i think with jet i'd been intimately involved in retail you know with diapers.com and wag and selling it to amazon and working inside amazon and i just felt like huge market huge tailwind it's the ecom's gonna continue to grow at double digit for the next five ten years um and i just believed that there wasn't you know it wasn't a winner take all that there was room for another player um and i thought we can raise a significant amount of capital and hire a great team so we had this really big vision with this tailwind raise a ton of capital and have a great team i thought if you do those three things right good things will happen i don't know what's going to happen either it works your exit a strategic wants it like if you're in the right market at the right time you have a great team and you've invested the capital wisely you've got an asset that in worst case is going to be worth more than the capital you raised that's that's my mentality with these things um in in anything you do right it's like there's the worst place to be is sort of in that no man's land where like you you spent um not a ton of money you don't have the best people but you spend enough money that is kind of expensive for somebody to buy as a strategic it's not really worth it you know people tend to buy it's the barbell strategy they'll buy the aqua hire you raise a million bucks and you bootstrapped it and you have like three good people and somebody will say like oh this is great like here's 10 million he's like oh that was like not a bad exit made a little money i'm gonna work for this company there's that and then there's like you can uh be big enough to matter to a really big company that has the capital to put down hundreds of millions or billions in an acquisition there's a lot of people in like the in the middle and that's what vcp is that's why it's like no 10 million 50 million let's hire the very best team if it's the right market there's going to be a buyer for it right and that's kind of the strategy what's interesting is so when i sold my company we never revealed the price but let's just say that like hypothetically it was like 30 or 40 million dollars um i noticed that i i just for a sake of argument that a a deal in that size it seemed like it was as hard of work as if i sold it for 400 billion dollars you know it's harder that's hard i think it's harder it was harder because i was doing a lot of the work i actually didn't hire a banker so i was doing most all the work and it was hell but it's not just the work on your side i think what he's pointing out is that the price tag is significant where the company can't just cut the check real quick right like you could with a small aqua hire but you don't have enough of an asset that they can say this is a big strategic bet that they're making you're in the middle and i think that's forget the entrepreneur's right it's always hard as an entrepreneur really tough place yeah yeah well i'm saying that that's just one of the reasons why it was hard it was hard for many reasons really hard you must be a really good entrepreneur because it's really hard i think to exit in that middle ground like it's hard to exit most companies in that middle ground they don't exit successfully you know it's easy to do the aqua hire and i think it's easy to do the big the big acquisition of a big company it's tough that's sort of like 10 to 100 million and the entrepreneurs i know that have exited in that in that space there they're strong they're like really strong well so that's kind of an interesting thing because i think that me well younger like even just a few months younger me as well as most people would think that well as far like if i could sell something for 20 to 30 that's like bite size ish that's like uh you know some company would buy us without having to get like board approval like oh it'd be a no-brainer for them to do it and what you're kind of saying and what i experienced a little bit is it's actually probably easier to be a little bit more audacious yeah and raise money and go after it or i would actually say the other way around it's easier to do that or in order if your goal is to build wealth and have a good life it's probably best maybe not to raise any money uh and never sell and just try to build the company over a long period of time but let's say you were you um but you don't have your brand name right so let's bring you back we give you youth but we take away your reputation right so we're gonna take you back you're 21 but you don't have the reputation uh but you do have the same sort of mindset that you have today you have the same knowledge let's say what spaces would you be going into and would you also be trying to do the same type of bet like do you think you could raise the large amount of money just through charisma and hustle and vision uh without having the reputation so take us take us do it through a scenario what do you think you would be interested in working on or building if you were 21 again today without the reputation yeah that's a great point and i think you know early on and a lot of people i think share this you feel like it needs to be something like really original or something nobody's thinking about it nobody's doing or something niche or like and that's kind of what it is it's niche and the venture capitalists are like it's not that interesting you know um and i've learned that it doesn't need to be something like niche or super inventive it could be just find a really big tam like just say something like okay health care okay and what's a really big idea like where's the puck going in healthcare i would study where the venture capitalists are investing what types of companies i do the research like where is the money going follow kind of the money because that'll kind of give you some idea of where where some of these trends are right now and uh you know with artificial intelligence and telehealth and things there's like a lot of money pouring into that so just i would look at the landscape i'd study the different companies who's getting funded who's doing well and think about is there another angle is there something not like inventive or super original just like just a little hook of something different that's not being done and put together a big vision that requires ultimately hundreds of millions of capital and work backwards from that and say okay you know that we think this is going to be a multi-billion dollar opportunity you know we're going to you know start with 10 million we're going to hire this great team here's division here's how we're going to get there work on that plan and that pitch deck i'd spend hundreds of hours on that deck and on the vision and mapping it out and somebody will bite because it's the right time it's the right space you know if you're really good and they feel like you've got something and you've got this big plan and you know there's a good chance you'll get that you'll get that that 10 million dollar c check to go hire a great team and you talked about you've talked about where's the puck going uh give us more what do you where what are some other so you talked about food delivery and you talked about how what the next evolution of that might be the restaurants on wheels that solves a bunch of problems you talked about transportation right huge tam flying cars that might be where the puck is going we see that google funded you know kitty hawk we and you know uber was working on it a bunch of people working on this maybe there's something there um i'll give you a couple more yeah so one i think conversational commerce so in retail i think the next big step change is the idea that you would use text and voice to order anything you want in a very conversational way so imagine you know talking to the to someone that is as knowledgeable as the most knowledgeable person in that area on the showroom of a specialty retailer you want to buy a tv it's like you're there at best buy talking to the tv expert you know and you're just conversing and somebody at the same time who knows you as well is your best friend um so hyper personalized this idea of getting a one best answer um the idea of like search engine 20 years from now is going to be laughably like the cassette tape it's like wait so dad you used to like go you wanted to buy a toast and you typed in toaster in this like search engine you have 10 000 responses and you had to like read reviews and look at all this and search and filter that's not the way it's going to be done you're basically just going to say hey i need a i need a toaster um how much i don't know what's a good amount uh 200 bucks you get a great toaster really good okay great wanna make a recommendation boom buy it and it just ships it right like it's gonna be very conversational and the the we talk a lot about personalization and detail but nobody's even close to doing it in a way that it's going to be done in the future and i think voice requires one best answer otherwise voice doesn't work you can't give you 100 things it's voice it's got to be like you know if you were asking your your best friend hey like you know i know you know toasters like what should i get man you know like that kind of thing it should be very uh on point who's doing this now that's exciting i like that a lot what what companies are doing this now i mean there's a lot of companies that are like again early stages of it and stuff but there's nobody again that's if you said who's got the world-class team who's raised you know significant capital you know nothing but is there a is there a product i can go look at and be like oh i get it i understand what he's getting at like i understand why mark is obsessed with this yeah i mean we had something called jet black when i was at walmart and we um it was basically this for new york city uh primarily parents and it was gangbusters i mean it was like you know people stopped using amazon prime it was they just dropped it it's like all the shopping the entire the entire while chair uh was was given to jet black and it was multiples of what they were spending on amazon it was deep into the tail it was everything people loved it and it was a great test it was very expensive because in order to get the comments to see the conversations um uh sorry you need to see a lot of conversations to have it automated so in the beginning you have humans in the loop to sort of bridge between the time that you know right there's the ai past tense did it go away or that still exists no it went away but it was expensive yeah it was expensive and there just wasn't the right time for walmart right but i think if for in a startup world yeah i think i think it's totally different because walmart maybe doesn't want to you know invest hundreds of millions or billions but a startup totally different doesn't hit your income statement everyone gets the gate knows it you put capital to work and you build something great so there's that i think in healthcare too i think like things i was talking about with telehealth and all the stuff coming together i think the idea of like um people taking control of their health uh with home diagnostics and things like there should be a dashboard that exists you can look up i put in my name okay mark lori here's my dashboard i've got a number of gadgets in the home that i do on a weekly and monthly basis like you brush your teeth twice a day to take care of your teeth what are you doing every day to take care of the rest of your health like you don't do anything yeah there's all kinds of devices and things you know monitor um you know a little prick of blood and monitor blood sugar uh you know do the blood test once a month get all your things in there look at the trends of what's happening with your psa do you have this issue and then basically the machine learning and through all the data to be able to see like okay you should see a doctor here you should do this then you should do this so here's the probability of dying at this age here's the you know here's the the heart attack risk that you're running your cholesterol is too high if you get it down here's your probability of heart attack comes down like sort of make it more transparent right now it's like this black box you go to the doctor once a year do some tests and whatever like it's just kind of like a black box like oh you know here's some medicine for your cholesterol you don't know what's what or why or how it impacts your odds and like whether you should be really worried a little worried no doctor will ever give you probabilities about anything there's no diagnostics it's like you have to go to the professional there's no home stuff i think all that's going to change in the future i do think people are going to like really take control of their their health in a completely different way and they're going to be doing things other than brushing their teeth to take care of themselves on a daily basis i just had a daughter and i feel like when she's my age she's gonna be like dad how are you even alive back then you guys had you didn't know what the hell was going on inside your body now we have this thing that we wear that tells me everything that i need to know i know when i take a bite of this my blood sugar goes up or down and i know like how stressed i am i know you know i think it's going to seem like cavemen how we we operate today good there's got to be certain things you get tested certain times you know my daughter had celiac disease we didn't figure it out until she was nine years old like that's i mean it's not that rare of a disease like some doctors should have been like hey here are the here are the things you do here the probabilities of what's what and you know these are the tests you need i was asking my mom my mom has celiacs as well and she found out when she was like 50 and um and she's like yeah as a kid everyone was like oh i don't know you just have an upset stomach all the time she's like you know i'm a kid in india i'm sure i had this my whole life just like nobody ever knew and i was like super i never gained any weight because i couldn't like process any of the food i was eating it took until i was 50 when i found out exactly everyone should have genetic profile you know that gives changes your probabilities based on genetics everyone should have that it should be you know tests certain times that influence your odds and probabilities and certain ways to you know structure everything that's just it's more organized like right now it's not organized i don't know if you guys feel that i feel like it's not organized at all yeah well you got like uh like a whoop and then an aura ring and i have a smart scale i've got uh like a glucose blood a continuing blue glucose blood monitoring i've got a smart bed uh like i've got like 18 different smart things but they are quite siloed but they don't actually tell me the answer they just you know like they don't actually say like uh th this is what this all means yeah you know maybe they'll say like you're extra stressed this morning sleep more or don't work out as hard or your body fat is too high but uh it's kind of limited to like pretty high level stuff yeah it should it should be way more structured you should have be much more in touch with it like sleep apnea is another thing i don't know so many people struggle with this they're like all these things and the doctor doesn't just say like you know it takes a long time before the doctor's like you should do a sleep apnea study or something like totally there there's things you can have devices that are listening near your bed that can know it sounds that sounds like well i always thought it was weird like this a lot of cancers you can are cure or are are okay like if you can get a certain type of cancer and be perfectly fine so long as you catch it early enough and it's kind of outlandish and archaic that like you can have a a cancer and not know for you know many months or a year it's like what the [ __ ] yeah you could have known this like instantly you know and that's kind of like crazy to me mri by the way there's mri scans and you do your whole body skin and like detailed look at you know anything cancerous and then stitch it together every year you do it and you can see micro changes and things that exists now it's just not made available to you know the the people because of the the cost of it but nobody even has the option of even knowing that that's available that i should do that you could imagine like a system that basically says hey here's the probability of cancer you can take this test it's a couple grand it's up to you but at least you know okay wait maybe i should just spend the two grand because it'll increase the probability of catching it x number of years in advance and i know okay it's healthier no we just wait until we're sick like you said with cancer it's like all right now it's now it's you know i like asking these questions because i like knowing like what meets your standards but basically who in this space are you looking at where you're saying that's kind of promising is there any like one or two companies yeah i i don't i kind of maybe i should more but i i really spend a lot of time just thinking about like a complete sometimes sometimes i if you know too much about a space it's hard to clean slate and invent because you're kind of like get tied too closely into what what people are doing so i like the idea of just thinking about it through the lens of a of a consumer on what is you know these trends are happening telehealth ai you know these trends are happening and then how do you stitch it all together that's just thinking sitting and thinking every day like what's the big idea and when it's really big you know nobody's doing it and then you can reverse engineer and go back and say there any people that are working on certain things that could be helpful to it but you got to go so big that you know that nobody's playing there and that's where i think the opportunity lies it's like yeah it's going to need billions of dollars to pull it off you're going to have to prove it in a in a small area uh it's going to be very expensive but then when you prove it it extrapolates out to a trillion dollar business like market cap opportunity yeah yes i don't i don't i couldn't tell you like i'm not like tell you all the different little components that exist right now something that you said earlier was basically you kind of like reverse engineer a little bit from like you'd be like i'm gonna find where the money's going then i'm gonna build this deck and i'm gonna um raise money and then go build the thing um what's something that let's say that i said mark i want to create a company and i want to sell it for 100 million plus to walmart or amazon in three years what opportunities exist in the e-com world or in the commerce world that amazon or walmart would buy my company because they desperately need something that i'm selling or some type of solution that i've created would you like him to do anything else for you sam the most specific question no that's actually not that specific a lot i mean a lot i'm not i don't work at amazon i don't know 100 million in three years yeah no i so well you said one personalized shopping conversation that's coverage i think that's that's not likely a hundred million that is like way bigger or it's or it's not exist like that's a little bit more binary i don't think a hundred million necessarily impossible sorry i hundred billion was just some three years i think it needs to be um a sort of a niche technology that could that's where the puck's going that's going to be helpful to differentiate it's going to be something three years is fast so it's going to have to be tech more than having shown real market traction but it's going to have to be a technology that's probably hard to build that involves you know ai the thing that comes to mind would be like fit analytics this idea that you're going online and you're buying um you know a address and being able to see it fit on you without having to get it delivered to your home you know return rates on apparel are 40 it's very expensive for retailers and it's a pain in the you know for people to buy stuff bring it try it on to send it back and things so the idea that you know my body dimensions and use artificial intelligence to know the inside dimensions of the garment to see exactly how it's going to lay in my body without having to try it on to cut down return rates dramatically there's billions of dollars that you can save retailers there and apparel is definitely um an area where where there's a lot of focus and um like that's just wanting to off the top of my head i love that that's a great answer that's a great answer there there's i still i saw this guy in japan um he's a billionaire entrepreneur and like this is like his third or fourth swing but he created a suit that had these ball like these dots on this black suit and he would send you this body suit for twenty dollars and these bull these white dots on this black body suit would uh you know like in a video game where they motion capture you yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what it was and it would it the camera was able to tell uh differently than if it was you weren't wearing this suit and he would use that to try to upsell you on proper fitting clothing i saw that it never went anywhere but i was like oh that's kind of an interesting listen for every idea out there there's hundreds of people trying that's why it's never really about the idea it's about execution it's about vcp so are they under capitalized do they have the best team in the world like and quippy i know you said that in the beginning but other examples of you know big vision right time massive tam like raise it a lot of capital and have the world-class team that's like all-in are there there's not that many examples i could think of in fact when i think of those examples they're usually examples of things that have worked that worked yeah i don't experience that many times where you have a world-class team ton of capital and a big vision at the right time those companies get acquired because mind was a good example of this uh deep mind got deep mind it was an ai company got acquired by google for 500 million when you know no usage yet it was just vision and team and then i think deepmind they said that once they've plugged it in to they do the fun stuff like they'll go beat the best go players in the world or the best chess players in the world so they show kind of its power it goes flexes from time to time but they also apply it to the google adwords um machine learning and i think it's generated like incremental multiple billions of dollars already for google just on the slight optimization of adwords and uh and then on the other side you have magic leap where magic leap would probably be the current example of raised like a billion bucks huge idea looks awesome in the demo but they haven't executed it well enough where it actually works yeah or you could argue also a little a little bit early yeah at that same exact company like today going forward right could be totally different game so it is kind of interesting it would be great to to map out vcp against companies that have worked and didn't work to see what the hit rate is right sorry guys i'm realizing i have a four o'clock yeah you gotta run okay uh where where should people find you if they want more if they want more plug how few people can follow you find you contact you whatever you want yeah i mean linkedin is is my primary where i'm putting out a lot of business advice and things like that so i do linkedin i just recently finally just launched instagram and and start becoming more active there but linkedin is probably the best place right now yeah all right mark this was great thank you for coming on all right thanks guys thank you it went way too fast yeah it was good but uh it ended quickly i wanted i had so much more we could have talked to you i had so much i think i think we should actually hit him up and be like dude after after this episode goes out and he gets some love we should ask him to come back because i need a part two i had like five other things i had so many i had so many questions he was it seems like he seems like a great guy he his uh he ha man he's really charismatic i get like why i understand why he's successful he would be dr he would be describing an idea off the cuff and i'd be like you know what this makes so much sense i would like i would back you to the hills yes this makes sense uh i could see why he's been able to raise so much money yeah he i asked that confidence question because he just oozes with that with charisma and confidence so let's talk about okay so first uh i really love that coverage i thought that was great i thought yes i agree i thought he was great and i thought he made for a great guest um especially the second half his setup was bad i cannot stand with people i think he was talking to a cis on a phone or a laptop with someone who's so successful like he is why do they not have awesome zoom setups yeah it's crazy to me uh but i think they're just like on the go all the time so they're like i don't even have like i don't even hold my phone this woman holds my phone for me and uh you know i i just sort of speak out loud i don't even type anymore that's my that's my uh uh bray who just said he doesn't own a computer was he i think he was that true or are you just bullshitting in the chat that's that's what i was told he doesn't own a computer see that's what i was saying dude i knew it i knew he's in that ultra rich wait so there's the mega rich the most rich is they don't own a computer nor do they even touch a computer their emails get printed out for them and they either hand write or just say things out loud and people go relay the messages i think he's one notch below that or he doesn't own a computer he just does [ __ ] off his phone that's weird to me i mean not weird because i mean if you're a baller go ahead b baller ball out but like what if you just want to type a long essay or you want to or if you want to just clubs like us can't understand the the feeling where you don't need to type nothing ever or or you just want to like search the web and like go and read it like it just seems like easy to have if you took my computer away forget the work i would be so bored i like need to like you know browse the internet yeah that's crazy so he doesn't own a computer that's pretty cool uh yeah the guy's awesome he said he had a few really good ideas i i wanted to ask him so he sent us these notes ahead of time and he said this thing about million the the difference between a million and a billion and i was like oh come on i'm dying we gotta save it yeah i wanted to know what he what he was gonna say i think we slowplayed it a little too much at the beginning and just as my fault i should have gone into one of these but okay so a couple of things so here's my takeaways here's my like i don't usually do takeaways because i don't think like i don't know i just don't bother usually usually it's not like i really learned so much that i really want to do takeaways i was just kind of entertained but in this i actually did have a few takeaways i thought i'm just going to rattle them off insight number one the barbell of selling your company it's very easy to sell at the small end and even at the high end the hardest path is actually that middle ground where both of us actually sold our companies and i think that that's true it feels very true from my experiences and i've never heard anybody like kind of say it out loud um so i thought that was that was a good insight i liked that basically what he i i don't think you summarized it or i don't think you said everything basically he said it's easier to sell a company for like he actually said 10 million or under or like hundreds of millions right exactly um and the reason why is you know the small one you can kind of cut the check just on talent the big one you're buying like kind of a more fleshed out asset of technology or traction or talent unique talent and in the middle he's like you've usually raised enough money where like your price your asking price is too high for them to just just do it without blinking but you don't have enough proof and enough of an asset that they can like justify you know a big strategic purchase and so that's actually the hardest one and i think he he was hinting at something that i think is true which is that entrepreneur who's done that is the most dangerous entrepreneur because they have enough money where the next thing they chase they're going to go bigger um but they didn't get enough where they're just satisfied and going to go chill on the couch or on an island somewhere and um they've been through it but they're not uh they're not done and i think that that's what he was kind of saying which is like those entrepreneurs are the ones you want to bet on i also when i invest that's like a great signal to me is when somebody has had a small win under their belt or a medium-sized win i should say yeah i had um andrew chen very successful asic's uh andreessen partners said some of the most he said the most dangerous uh entrepreneur is someone who's uh somewhat wealthy enough that they uh that they're set but they have a huge chip on their shoulder exactly and he goes for example travis before he started uber uh you know he had red swoosh which was like a kind of tens of millions win um ev williams before twitter you know he had blogger and you know that's a good win but you know went for more and there's a bunch of examples mark cuban did the same thing right okay some other things i thought he was interesting so his model i didn't realize this beforehand but his model is basically it's kind of like moonshots it's basically he's anti the traditional playbook of silicon valley which is raised in small steps so raise a little bit of money make a little bit of progress raise a little more money make a little more progress raise more money make more progress he's sort of like find the biggest market you can go after raise a bunch of money and go make the boldest bet in that market for example what he did with jet he's like e-commerce huge market and growing double digits um i thought it was interesting he was saying like you you know you don't need this like brand new novel invention it's like the bet is going to be on execution and you do want to have like a new hook or like kind of like the 10 to 20 that's that's innovative but like 80 is the same as other players in the market and so he was saying do that basically go raise a big chunk of money recruit the best people the best people make great product and then go raise a huge amount of money to go for you know go for the the home run shot and um i thought that was interesting most people don't use that playbook or don't talk about it and that's like his specific lane that he did as an entrepreneur and he's doing as an investor i thought that was cool he also i asked him a question that you laughed at a little bit but i thought it was a great question the reason i left it was a great question and he actually gave a great answer but you asked like what's a company i could start and in three years sell for 100 million dollars to amazon walmart it was like so specific that i was like it's almost like hey mark like i don't want to think just tell me what to do and i'll go do it like it was such a such a solved my problem for me i just laughed well it was uh what was the word that you said the other day or uh orthogonal orthogonal it was my orthogonal way of asking uh of asking um what is a problem that big ecom businesses have yeah that they that they have that what are problems that need to be solved i'll paint that yeah that was my way of asking that you have a great answer he gave a great answer the answer he actually gave a previous answer where he said something like a conversational uh commerce which is a really cool thing he'll explain but the answer that he gave for that was uh oh uh fitting virtual fitting yeah virtual fitting so he gave a ton of really cool answers and and the guy this guy uh mark laurie who was the uh he started jet.com which he sold for three and a half billion where and then he was the ceo or uh president of walmart ecom and then he uh before that he had sold the company for 600 million dollars to amazon so like his his his his perspective is like about almost as great as it can be yes exactly um so i thought that was really strong and i liked um i liked some of his stuff on the interviews kind of like job interview side i think i don't know how much people will love that content because it's not as fun and it's not as junk foodie as ideas right but as somebody who ever if you ever actually have to do that i thought there was some good good insights in there and even though it was a little bit um like safe like nobody can disagree the things he was saying were good um i didn't feel like it was just cookie cutter like i think that i think he genuinely believes it and that's genuinely his approach um and it matters a lot to him and i think that came through during that part which is cool because you always wonder like this guy's doing this and this and this how is he doing it well it's like it's always he's got great people underneath them doing all those individual projects on a day-to-day basis all right well then how do you find those great people to actually make the difference between failure and success of the same idea is having you know that great operator underneath so i thought that was pretty good what'd you think at that part yeah i wanted to ask him more about it but we didn't have time but basically it sounds like he's not totally in the weeds of his businesses which is the way to go um you know like if you can if he can go i don't want to be in the weeds of anything i don't want to be in the weeds of my marriage i don't want to be in the weeds of parenting the weeds are the weeds bro i don't want to be in the weeds i only want to be in the weeds of the things that i want to be in uh and when you start a company there's so much stuff that you think you have to do and it's cool i wanted to hear his perspective of it he's like look i have the vision i hire the initial people and i raise a ton of money and i just deploy that money and make everyone else uh specialize in what there's what they specialize in but we didn't get to ask him about it well one thing he did show was sort of like when we were you were like how do you um how do you figure out what that vision should be and he talked about a couple things he's like i look at where the trends are where's the puck going right he's like one way i do that is i see where investors are pouring in money okay that tells me that these spaces are probably big or these technologies are breakthrough technologies and so it's either like a technology like ai machine learning okay cool i can apply that in another industry or everything's a bunch of people pouring money into e-commerce okay e-commerce is probably really big or education healthcare is really big all right that's a big space now how do i go create the most bold vision that has like you know a slightly novel hook and i thought it was cool that he was basically like i don't get bogged down in the in kind of the details of like what is this player doing versus this player versus this player he's just sort of like how should it be right when he was talking about healthcare he's like i should just wake up i have a dashboard that says here's what's going on in your body and it recommends that hey you should get this checked with a doctor or you should improve this and um and i thought the kind of like just from a mind of a customer instead of like industry research i thought yeah better that's a big amazonian thing to do is is that which is like you just start with the customer and you say here's how their life should be that would make them really happy all right now i have a pleased customer now i'll go figure out how to make that happen instead of the other way around which is what can i do and then uh does that partially satisfy customer okay that's good enough and i wanted to ask him about air uh about amazon and working with bezos and things like that i i wonder what his opinion will be buying the timberwolves i feel like there's more we could do there because he bought a sports team you know one thing this is a crazy story that i'll just share here i didn't get to bring it up with him but but uh ben found this when he was doing some research for this was he he goes um with when jet was when jet was growing or early on with jet they had a contest i don't know if you've seen this this article but a contest about um who can acquire the most customers for jet you become a marketer you you go spread the word whoever whoever does whoever gets the most customers gets a hundred thousand shares of jet and some guy went and did it and he he basically just did like kind of like paid marketing in a unique way he spent eight the guy invested eighteen thousand dollars into the paid marketing won the contest and his hundred thousand shares became worth 20 million when it sold and so this guy turned 18 grand and did 20 million as a fan of the company outside the company probably made more than anyone else in the company besides mark which is amazing to me i remember that story and i was one of those people trying to uh this was like you participated in this oh definitely you didn't you didn't participate like if you were just it was basically so robin hood did a good job of this uh i believe it was robin hood um clubhouse has done a pretty good job but like basically robin hood's campaign right before they launched was you're on the waiting list refer five people to move up the spot right uh this was jet's version of that although jet was first i believe uh then robin before robin hood and it went incredibly viral if i remember correctly i think they had billboards promoting this the contest yeah do you remember that uh when you would i think we should have asked him about this all right we'll save this one for next time but i thought this is an amazing story yeah i could spend about two more hours with him easily so i hope he comes back let us know in the reviews what you think oh quick update uh we're going to miami i think in uh eight days or something june 4th uh we sold 300 tickets uh that's great i think we have we have a few left right we're releasing maybe what 80 more hundred more something like that yeah we moved it to uh 400 it was 300 we moved it to 400. um we'll see what happens all right if you want to come see us if you want us to autograph your dollar bills bring them to miami uh june 4th uh i don't know how they should find the eventbrite just go to uh mfmpot or myfirstmillionpod.mfmpod.com uh and put in your email we'll email you the details right yeah and there'll be a link on there if you go to mfnpod.com and also if you just follow one of us on twitter you could definitely see the links where we're promoting it and do us a favor if you liked this episode with mark when we post it um we're going to post it i don't know i guess go on linkedin and we i want to shower him with love of people being like dude this was great come back on and then he'll come back on so we'll we need to game linkedin a little bit i might have to dust off the old linkedin password to go and uh and because that's the thing when guests come on they i've consistently heard this from the very beginning of this podcast which is dude i get way more messages about this podcast than any other podcast i've ever been on i don't know why that is i don't think our audience is bigger but something that works and when they get that that magic moment that of of people emailing them being like it worked that was amazing it worked they're they're down to do whatever and come back on or do whatever else and you only need about 10 20 30 like you don't need a significant amount right um 20 emails in one day being like i loved it i love you is a lot of emails for for most people it feels like it feels like a million so mark's name is a r c space l o r e look him up on linkedin and just whatever his recent thread is just click like comment and be like just saw you on the podcast so good yeah saw you on my first million amazing yeah

episode andrew what's going on dude hey man how you doing i got a really bad really bad cold i spent all day yesterday with kleenex up my nose so uh if my voice sounds a little froggy that's why it only sounds froggy because you said it sounded froggy i think you're okay so andrew wilkinson good friend of mine good friends of the pod is this description that i used three or four weeks ago the same description is that is that the same thing are you wearing that same personality is that the same life or have you done something new and amazing because you're always pulling something out of your sleeve uh yeah i've got i think since then i've launched a couple businesses actually but no the description's still accurate um and so we're going to talk about a couple things the first thing we're going to talk about is well you got a bunch of ideas here i'm excited for the ideas but i want to talk about billy of the week because we talked about two people last time you were here and that was uh it's right next to the biology episode as the most listened episode ever really no way which episode was that the bill the one where we did the two billies yeah something like i think almost 50 000 people listen to it which is like it's an hour-long thing it's a lot of time crazy um and then the third most listened thing was the one we did after that so you know it could just be it okay yeah it's the other side uh move aside sean yeah so it's like biology is like uh whatever it is you're like within hundreds or like a thousand of it and then you're the next two and so that's why i figure we'll start off with that one but you sent me i yesterday i asked you to tell me an interesting person and i'm gonna go do a ton of research on them and i did and i have a feeling you already know a lot about this person but what's this what's this person's name so his name is uh i don't know how to say it i think it's george apollo it's a brazilian named oh there you go okay can you say his name please and every time we need to say his name we'll just say brayu i'll say his first name his last name is german so i don't know if there's a right way of saying it but his first name is joshua is his considers his first name as well because in a lot of the articles i read about him they call them majarje sorry george apollo it might be his middle paulo might be his middle name or it might be like a double first name i'm not sure but josh this guy's totally mysterious he doesn't like to talk about what he does uh there's only a few interviews with him online um but he basically i mean if you think about the businesses that he owns you would know them so burger king uh budweiser tim hortons craft foods popeyes heinz ketchup right so he basically goes out he finds these amazing you know multi-generational businesses that have been around for 50 plus years that do something very very simple that's just gonna grow over time he goes out he usually raises a ton of debt and then he goes and buys them and takes them over and he's been doing this for i don't know 40 years or something like that starting in brazil let's give a little bit of background of him um so halsey he's about 75 years old right um and he's based out of brazil he's a brazilian guy and when he started at the time i don't think that there were these like brazilian tycoons you know every article that i read about they said that he was one of the first folks in in brazil to become one of these uh private equity or warren buffett like people out of brazil and like you said very little is known about him and he doesn't give interviews and in a lot of the interviews that i read about him they said we actually tried to talk to a bunch of his friends and nearly all of his friends said you know thank you for reaching out but he's politely asked us not to speak about him in interviews so he prefers to stay behind the scenes and the way that his career started and is uh in 1931 at the age of 32 he had some jobs beforehand where he was a banker but he started this one bank uh abreu you want to help me out here here's what it's pronounced here's how you pronounce it you see that right there it's called garantia i don't see it did you put it in the chat it's highlighted it's highlighted in the dark i think it's garantea or something like that okay and it was described as like the goldman of brazil um i don't know if it was described at the time like that but he was 32 when he launched it it was 1971 and what made it kind of famous was he had a very uh i wouldn't call a laid-back culture but he didn't look at resumes but instead he looked for uh what he described as psd which was poor or let me see what does psd stand for poor smart and deep desire to get rich yeah poor smart and deep desire to get rich that's what he looked for was people who had psd and he would hire these folks and in previously at different companies you would automatically get a bonus if you were one of the partner but they created some type of system that was uh they tried to make it as based off of merits as much as possible so a lot of different people could get bonuses and also the bonuses you could choose do you want more stock or do you want more cash and it was a great way to incentivize people and it kind of created this iconic culture that that seems what they're they're famous for and it grew to be quite huge it was something like a billion dollars in profit at one year but he said that they got cocky and they screwed up they they overbought some stuff and it eventually went south and it sold for 650 million dollars which is a still a ton of money but i think it was minuscule compared to how big it got so i have a question for you andrew and then we're going to get into this 3g thing so then after he sold it for 650 he started buying gillette stock and with his other older founders at the old company he started 3g which was a play on their name and there was three partners and they ended up buying uh burger king um tim hortons all the companies that you said and at this point he's worth something like 25 billion dollars and one of the one of the richest people in the world um but i had a ton of questions uh that about this guy that i think that you might know or at least you have a better input than i do the first is how on earth like when people say they're starting a bank like he did what's that process like that sounds so ambiguous and so hard to understand well i think like people hear bank and they think like oh a big pile of money like wells fargo or something but bank the term banker means so many different things it could be somebody who works at a bank and lends out money or whatever but a banker is really like a real estate agent for businesses right or for bonds or equities or whatever it is so it's like a person you go to or a group of people you go to who will figure out problems for you and facilitate transactions so let's say you sam go i need to raise 100 million dollars of debt for the hustle because i need to expand a banker will go out and they will go to all the wealthy people they know and all the different you know corporations and say hey here's this great guy you should lend money and then they take a fee in between and so in a lot of ways is the world's best business you're a middleman on these huge transactions multi-billion dollar transactions and you're taking a two and a half to five percent fee on everything you do so with like 50 to 100 people you can do crazy amounts of money what skill set so when this guy started at 31 uh 32 what skill set would he have needed in order to make this happen well it's really heavy on two things one it's like sales and stuff and then the other is kind of financial acumen and modeling and all that so you'd probably get a bunch of people in the office who are like super hardcore spreadsheet junkie excel types who can like figure out you know how to structure a deal and then you'd also have people who can do the very high level sales right so they're basically smooth talking and calling and selling and positioning everything to facilitate all the deals do you consider yourself a banker no i actually generally really hate dealing with bankers um and i i think it's kind of like real estate agents right like i'm very skeptical of real estate agents i think in the next 50 years they probably won't exist a lot of the time a real estate agent is just a person who puts up a listing online for you opens the door for a few people and then takes a huge fee which seems a crazy and out of line right and and now there's great real estate agents let's say you have a weird property that might not sell they know how to spruce up there's one there's one in a hundred that's amazing and will sell your property for more but a lot of the time they're useless and the same thing is kind of true with bankers i think if you've got a great business and you want to raise money you should just go and call a bunch of wealthy people and try and raise the money yourself because at the end of the day a lot of the time what bankers do is build some decks and then breathe on the phone while you talk to other people and then take a huge fee how much money have you raised uh we've raised maybe uh well it depends it depends on how you think about it so um i would say in the neighborhood of about two 200 250 million or something like that if you include our ipo or our reverse takeover we just did not including that what's a 100 200 maybe oh so the the stack that you did wasn't a six including it was 60 million that was that was how much we raised when we took that business public wow so then your funds have well over a hundred yeah and you didn't use a banker for any of that no we just called people we knew i mean we had we bumbled into this world like i had no idea five years ago six years ago even i didn't know what the difference between a banker and a bank teller was i had no idea and because of that we just kind of kept meeting interesting business people and as you met interesting business people they keep saying hey are you guys raising money because i'd love to invest with you and so eventually when we had big enough deals that were interesting and we wanted partners i just called those people and we did it ourselves so back to this guy he uh like when you're starting something like this and this is i you like this guy because i imagine like you you you kind of want to you want to steal some of his life right i mean you want to you want you you you want to emulate some parts that he's done yeah well i think like we're probably similar in that like we're both attracted to these really simple businesses like selling beer or razors like there's both of us come from like this weird tech world where we do this like knowledge work you you write an email newsletter i do a design and then two years later it doesn't exist right i like the longevity and the kind of simplicity of more traditional businesses so i love that and i think the idea of just buying these super safe boring steady eddy businesses that do something simple in the world and just making them better actually sounds like a lot of fun and i wrote a note below but the key thing about that what he does is um generally they have one key insight right so it'll be something as simple as when they bought budweiser it was on the third generation they'd gotten super rich right so it was like the first generation built it the second generation like were amazing they went to harvard they grew it the third generation took over they got sloppy didn't really care about growth they had fancy offices and private jets and stuff and so when they bought it they just look at it and go oh it's been run in a kind of a sloppy way and they've lost their discipline we can buy it with a lot of debt and then we can just make it way better pay off our debt and then we own budweiser and so it's this crazy coup for these guys from brazil who you know they came from basically uh you know started at zero although i think they were you know upper middle class in brazil but starting there to owning budweiser is crazy and i want to ask you about how to get into those deals and when i read about him it sounded like he was the young guy of a three-person partnership um which definitely i think he's actually the old guy so there's the two younger guys the younger guys actually go and they run the businesses so like one of the partners i believe went in and runs um runs uh what is it called qsr which is like owns tim hortons and all that stuff sorry i meant from his first thing so his first thing got him his big nut his first thing made him like 650 or they sold for 650 and from what it sounded like it was like a a little bit of an older guy who had a little bit been there done that kind of brought him along and he was the young guy of that partnership totally yeah and then he did the same thing and now he has younger partners right and um and so i have i had a few questions about this but i wanted to so let's just talk about this guy's strategy at 3g in his whole life it seems he's done the same thing which is he's a cheapskate he's frugal he's incredibly frugal um so he's done a couple things like he has a few like phrases that they would say which is like he's like costs are like fingernails you have to cut them constantly and he would do famous things like when they bought burger king they banned color copies meaning when you're using the photo copy machine uh he was like just black and white only um you also what was this thing you said about private jets they also force people to print on both sides they'd say you not only can you not print color but you have to print double-sided um so the first thing they would always do whenever they buy a business is they sell all the private jets immediately right and let's be real most fortune 500 companies have like between 1 and 10 private jets and they just say f that we don't need those they sell them and it's kind of a statement and then from that point on the new ceo and all the executives they have to fly economy and they have to stay in motels and they all they it's i love that right i think it just sets the tone from the top in a really interesting way and these are people i mean the ceo of abe imbev he's probably worth like hundreds of millions of dollars and he's staying at like a quality inn but i think there's something to demonstrating that at the top if you want your lower lower level employees to care too i actually think that that's a stupid thing so i get staying at cheap hotels because changing it staying at like a marriott courtyard which is like a 89 a thing i'm on board with that it's probably even cheaper it's 50 bucks i'm cool with that it's just you can have a fine clean comfortable place although i do like having room service because if you get into a place late you want that but whenever these people say they fly economy i'm like that's kind of stupid if i'm flying overnight i need a comfortable i need to be comfortable so i could like be ready to roll you know you're like you don't want your athlete to like work off the two hours sleep um do you actually believe that people do that i think they do i mean maybe it's just lore uh maybe these guys are super rich and they pay for it personally or something like that but um i i don't know i mean i think if you're i know like walmart has a big corporate jet um fleet and they actually have a really good argument for it which is they're constantly visiting stores and that's their way of kind of like whipping all the store managers and making sure they do a good job and so they have all these tiny little jets that fly between small towns and if they were to fly commercial it would take 10 days to do two days of work so i think there's a good argument for it there but i can't imagine the ceo of abe imbev needs to be flying all over the world constantly if he's flying once or twice a month it's not a big deal to be on a commercial plane or whatever i just think it's kind of a i think it's a neat thing to do i personally like you know i i wouldn't i would feel bad like i would be worried that i'm gonna get the worst ceo because they want like their perks or whatever but the kind of people these guys hire like these guys when they took over burger king they hired a 35 year old as a cfo right or maybe even a 30 year old and the owner is the ceo yeah yeah i i wrote about it they hired a 32 year old who was part of their management company and he took it over and he kicked ass a few things that he did was at the time burger king was was trying to advertise predominantly towards young men and he goes no we're going to be for everyone so we're going to advertise for everyone um another thing that he did was remember the king burger king like the king yeah he was like that's kind of creepy get rid of that um and then the uh the third thing that he did was at the time burger king employed something like 28 000 people so they owned most of their restaurants and they would hire the people he goes now we're going to switch to a franchise and we're going to help all these franchise owners line up alone so you guys can make your own places really nice and we're going to help you make it nice and that was the big switch that he did now burger king i believe crushes it and this is we've seen this in our own investing like often having one thesis right so the thesis could be hey margins are really shitty you know they're they're five percent they should be 15 and we can do that via via very simple improvements or something simple like this burger king deal where they went into big debt and they actually paid up a really high price to do it but the insight they had was well as soon as we take over we're just going to spin out all of our corporately owned locations and franchise them and by doing that we're going to raise all the money to pay off our debt right and so they did that and then they ended up taking it public with ackman actually um and did insanely well in it oh that's interesting and when they did it there was a funny story about the guy um who we're talking about uh i'm gonna try and say his name one more time uh what is it i wanna when i see it i wanna say jorge um but anyway he um so there's a funny story about him that he had never had burger king until they bought the company and it was like a multi-billion dollar deal he didn't eat it until they bought the company and when he ate it he was like ah this is too big and he's known for like really only drinking water and eating really healthy but he owns you know non-healthy stuff what's your take on that do you think that does that rub you the wrong way are you like oh no i think i think it rubs me in the wrong way i think he sounds like he's really good at kind of being secretive and pr that's exactly the sort of thing i wouldn't want to give out i wouldn't want it out in public or whatever i think it sounds kind of lame so this type of business um that you like and i i enjoy it too but um would when i was reading all about him would you say this boy to me it boils down to you have to be good at fundraising money so you have to be good at getting convincing some type of rich institution or rich people to give you money the second thing you have to get good at is you have to recruit really really talented people typically people that are highly recruited at other places typically people who can start their own thing typically people who are probably already wealthy you have to hire them and then third and probably most important you have to be really good at inspiring and leading them so you have to be a leader of leaders is that like the three three pillars to this am i missing exactly you nailed it it's really and it's really really hard the hardest part is recruiting the the amazing people like our biggest challenge isn't doing deals it's like we could do a deal every month it's how can we find enough amazing people to run all these businesses and then how can we validate that they're going to be able to do what we need from them and you know you think about like that 32 year old he was probably working in head office for 10 years and they saw all this stuff but it's a huge chance to hand that to him and that could have gone really really poorly um but i i think that's exactly that's the warren buffett playbook right it's like how do you be a leader of leaders how do you give them positive coaching without like getting too involved in the day-to-day and the fundraising part actually seems like the easiest the fundraising honestly like it was so when we did we have a we have a fund and uh which we raised during covet just because we thought we were gonna get mobbed and it was really weird we actually was like like we thought we were gonna have this no no we thought we were gonna have like overwhelming amounts of deals to do and we thought it would be a great time to have excess capital and uh that didn't happen right everyone was actually weirdly optimistic and the government wrote the check and all that stuff but um but doing doing the money raising wasn't actually that hard like running an agency for or owning an agency for 15 years and doing sales for a long time like that's easy you just have a fun conversation with someone you walk them through a deck you point to your track record that that was totally fine the hard part is really the execution of the actual deals and hiring the right people and i would argue i mean i don't know really what i'm talking about entirely strictly from reading it seems like executing the deals is hard but it's not that hard the hard part is really the people part is that we i we've done deals we just did our biggest deal ever um and it was over 100 million dollars and it was no more work or complexity than doing a one million dollar deal and in fact it was simpler than a one million dollar deal because it's just a better business with a better team in place and more momentum has always complicated people uh well in our in our public company we bought a company called stamp which is one of the top ratings and reviews apps on shopify um there's a 110 i believe total uh it gets paid out it's a structure you'd have to look at the press release for the exact structure but wow that's in around there and when i was reading this i'm in the middle of reading um human nature by robert greene and the reason have you heard of that it's an amazing book i've been reading that too have you really wow it's amazing isn't it crazy it's so good it's so everything he does is great and the laws the laws of human nature isn't it called right yeah the laws of human nature and i already read it and now i'm rereading it again but i'm studying it like i was like i'm taking a semester of robert greene and the reason why i am reading it is because i thought that when i was getting into business all that would matter is like business and you're like well what's business it's like i don't know um uh like i guess selling stuff making the product really good um in my business it was like i'm just gonna write words that people like like it's really simple but what i've learned is it's far more important to understand and motivate human beings and have really effective day-to-day interactions with people and in order to do that you have to have a little bit of a i'll call it like a machiavellian type of thing to you where like people love you yet they're a little bit fearful of you they kind of view you as like a little bit of mysterious like you have to attract these people and they have to both want to be around you yet think that you're formidable and be a little bit like nervous of like oh man if i don't join this person they're going to crush me and live up to your expectations what do you mean well like basically how do you one of the things like some of the some people i've worked with have this thing where you just want you always want to raise the bar and you always want to live up to their expectations so they say this is the bar this is what i expect from you but they do it in a very flattering way like you're really smart you work really hard i'm so impressed with you i know you can achieve this right and then they set this crazy bar and you just naturally want to live up to the expectations and i've always struggled with that uh well just different different partner business partners and stuff have dealt with over the last couple years um but but uh like with employees and stuff i've always had this habit of wanting to be liked and i still want to be liked but i want to be firm and i want to have boundaries because in the past what i've done is in wanting to be liked i've excused like somebody failing and said like it's okay don't worry about it it's fine and then i'd quietly just dismiss them and then not use them for tasks like that whereas i think it's actually really important to be like hey look like it's okay you effed up but like you let me down and here's why you let me down and here's how this impacted everything or here's the bar and here's how what i need from you and whatever it is and i've always been terrible at that it's crazy i mean elon musk has it bill ackman who you know has it this guy who we're talking about he definitely had it when i looked at him and i like would see how he would dress and how he held himself uh you know travis kalanick kind of has it where they're just like you're just you're afraid of them in a way of like they inspire me but like um they they can crush it like whatever they whatever they set their mind to they're gonna get done and that's regardless if you agree with their ethics or not but you definitely could agree that like these guys are good they're going places there's a great story about uh sheryl sandberg at facebook i forget who who told this story but she goes i was in a meeting with cheryl and i you know i gave this presentation and then she walked to me outside and she said during your presentation it was great but you kept saying like only stupid people say like and you're not stupid and then she walked away right and you can look at that and go oh my god i can't believe she did that that's so mean but the way she told it was like it was a kind of a backhanded compliment that told her something that was embarrassing it's like saying like hey you have like you know you have lettuce in your teeth or whatever you don't want to hear it but like it's helpful and i think i've been very bad at that kind of stuff i think you need to give more firm feedback that's stories from um erratic uh candid or whatever that would be a radical candor it's a good one but um as i was reading this guy i'm like man in order to get into some of these deals like heinz um whatever in order to attract these i mean basically like um this guy and the folks that we talk about and maybe i think you as well andrew that you're like uncommon amongst the uncommon and you have to lead the killers so like you've got to be the killer amongst killers and that is kind of like a fascinating thing to think about because to bring it back to what i originally said when i got into business i thought it was all about coming up with creative ideas it's like no i just got to be a leader of men and women and that's really hard so i've been studying how to do that and i've been studying like war leaders been studying you know who really is good at this like celebrities like marilyn monroe it's like it's basically kind of seduction a little bit um and how do you just like get people under your spell and hopefully your spell is not positive but i don't yeah i think like there's a i think it sounds stressful though like the idea of like i'm gonna be a killer and i'm gonna you know do all this stuff and be machiavellian like i really don't i don't like that feeling of like feeling like i'm manipulating someone what i like to think about more and what's been more instructive for me is just reading psychology like robert cialdini and all that stuff and figuring out incentives and one of the things i've learned is that if somebody is incentivized to not work as hard as you or not care as much as you they won't right so people do whatever it's it's shocking but they'll do whatever whatever the financial or day-to-day lifestyle incentive is where they can take the path of least resistance they will and then they'll create their own narrative for why they're doing it right they might say i'm not working hard because you know i don't like my work environment or whatever or there's a problem with management or whatever it is but often it's actually them just going why would i work harder i don't make more money right i don't get a bonus for working harder i clock in my time or whatever so i think a lot of the time this stuff is just an incentives problem and that that's pervasive through everything going back to realtors they have an incentive to just sell your house for the lowest price to get it done to get to lock in their fee they have an incentive against you i agree with you that that is part of the that is that is that is a portion of it i would say that there if there's two portions those are both them but i think you're totally full of [ __ ] in that you don't care about this because you do your pers your your public image is and i don't know if you mean to do this or not but i'll tell you what your image is it's like you're like a cool guy like you dress nice you've got slick back hair you're good looking you have these cool glasses you're a designer i mean brother look at like the website what's the url of tiny um tiny capital tiny capital you use the same wonderful imagery used like you have a brand and a brand is is exactly this machiavellian thing that i'm describing of how to manipulate the field i don't know emotion ugh i don't know i think you're the word machiavellian but you are manipulating people to feel a certain way oh absolutely no no absolutely but it's like copy right like knowing how to write good copy what you're really doing is you're taking people along for an emotional journey by using various words right and there's two ways to look at it one is oh it's who's super manipulative or the other is no you're trying to communicate and you're an effective communicator right and don't get me wrong we definitely do like yuck up the kind of the softness of what we do but it comes from like you know we dealt with wall street bankers we dealt with people trying to acquire companies they were shitty so this is me going oh well i hated that how can i market to those people who have the same hatred that i did or whatever but yes there's definitely a lot of public public image stuff that we think about so we'll wrap up with this billy of the week uh segment but what's your main takeaways from this guy and um there's a book about him it's called like greatness i think i i couldn't find i only saw it in portuguese i don't know if there's an english version yeah it's called uh oh what is it the dream big dream it's on amazon yeah it's quite good i read it maybe four or five years ago what's your main takeaways from this guy why the biggest what can i learn from him and what should i avoid i think it's like you don't need to do something innovative and crazy right you don't need to be the next elon musk or start some crazy technology you can just choose a traditional business that's very poorly run and run it better and i you know even better if it's a business that's low risk growing and kind of successful despite bad management or you know bloated cost structure or something and you wrote something in here that was important which is different than how i perceived you as doing which was um you need to be comfort comfortable taking on outside capital and having partners well i think like for this exact structure right so what they do they raise a lot of debt and that allows them to have you know a lot of control because they have debt but it's silent it's not involved in the operations and that gives them the ability to just like overrule and take over um and you got to raise a lot of money i mean if you're going to go buy heinz ketchup like that's not the kind of deal you can get like a crazy deal on you're going to have to pay the highest market price for in order to do that you got to raise a lot of money compared to what we do like we're not buying the heinz ketchup we're buying the like random local ketchup brand right that's like been successful in a small niche those deals you can find oh and i i want to ask one more question before we wrap up actually so i actually was thinking about this so like you're further along you're a few years older than me not only a couple years older but in terms of like career success you're you're a fair bit ahead of me in terms of like you know we're both going down the same path um and then one path in front of that you're friends with guys like bill ackman these folks that are worth you know billions of dollars in that and and yeah like they're just doing [ __ ] so like along this path let's say of the spectrum of people doing stuff it starts with like a scrappy internet nerd in their bedroom like you and i were and then it comes to like alright you get a little bit of success like i have and then it comes like all right you're starting to like move things a little bit but even you said you're still a pipsqueak compared to like you know enactment or whatever what how does this this transition from going from like someone who's kind of interesting to like a mover and shaker on at a global scale how do you does that kind of seem like a crazy transition to you because it's kind of like you're not far from that it seems um but like these guys like bill ackman when they say something they're in the news when they say um when they like make a trade every once in a while it can like impact millions of people yeah i mean i don't i look i just look and look up and see how far we have to go i still feel really really small and you start you know like you know when you like you're running your company and you're like you tell people like oh we do a million dollars a year in profit and to you that's like a crazy amount of money and then you realize oh my god there's businesses out there that do 30 million or 100 million or a billion dollars of profit every year and the numbers just keep getting bigger i just find as we get bigger i just start talking to people who have businesses that are way bigger and you know it's funny you mentioned ackman i mean ackman i don't know what he's worth probably like four or five six billion dollars but this george apollo guy he's worth 25 right and so everyone's looking up at some some person that they want to be and someone doing bigger stuff i think um it's kind of like the analogy i would use is if you're an athlete and you start out as just some casual high school athlete and then you end up in the olympics and you just keep rising up and doing more and more stuff and eventually you look around and go like whoa holy crap i made it to the olympics this is crazy um but i don't necessarily think it buys you any happiness or a better life necessarily and i think there's a really interesting decision of well do you want to be a mover and shaker is it worth all the downsides i think there are quite a few no [ __ ] i agree um all right let's talk about some ideas um what we're going to talk about is not necessarily an idea but something that you're working on right now i want to talk about capital daily because i've seen you i've seen this from the beginning and i'm getting updates this latest update sounds pretty amazing yeah so i mean the last two years oh actually let me just zoom out and i'll say talk about what happened so basically uh i read the newspaper every day uh i would read the new york times and wall street journal and read all this incredible investigative reporting and then i would pick up my local paper which is called the times colonist here in victoria canada and it was just there's nothing it was like they didn't have any journalists they'd laid everyone off and it was all just like ap wire service so it's like international news and i was like how the hell do i figure out what's going on in my own city and i realized there was a few people doing local reporting but there's this gap there and so i thought okay well if i want this i'm sure other people do and i looked at buying the local paper actually but they wanted like a crazy amount of money they had like printing presses like you know unionized employees it's like a cruise ship not a speed boat it'd be a pain in the ass to buy it and so i went to a friend who is a um a stay-at-home mom who had some experience doing a bunch of writing and i said hey why don't we just start a mailchimp account and we'll come up with a brand we called it capital daily and we'll send out a daily newsletter and we'll just summarize like hey here's like three or four stories of things that are happening in town so we start doing this and i i have a friend who runs a ppc agency and i get him to just go buy ads and i realize i can buy ads for like nothing no one's advertising for local news break that down uh so you're saying you you had a friend that would buy advertising to get new users and you said hey could you see if you could run some ads to get uh email subscribers to capital daily yeah i was like how do i get this to scale as quickly as possible a i saw an opportunity and b i realized that in local news usually there's one winner right so historically there's usually been one big newspaper and so i was like how do i get this as big as possible as fast as possible and i was also just impatient i was like i have money i can afford to do it i'm just going to spend like 200 grand on ads and so we spent i don't know 100 200 grand and very quickly we got to like 25 000 subscribers and i just started hiring journalists and uh built out a team and it was it was crazy like i would be in a cafe and people would stop me and be like hey are you the capital daily guy like thank you so much it's amazing like the first thing i do when i wake up and drink my coffee is read your newsletter and that was an amazing feeling like i've got all these other businesses that are like big and i've never ever ever felt that sense of community and just like doing something important and so i was having a lot of fun with it uh we started hiring a whole bunch of people and uh we realized like hey this is hard like the advertisers don't understand it like people who buy newspaper ads they're just stuck in their ways they're old they're like all boomers and stuff and so we're having a really hard time selling ads i also built this big news team and was like burning all this money and i was kind of freaking out going like i don't know if this is have i got myself into some trouble here but a little over six months a year ago i partnered with this guy farhan and he had scaled the biggest local news site in vancouver and he took over as ceo and now he's monetized it and i think we're gonna break even very soon on uh the local stuff in victoria um we've started selling out ads and i think like on a unit economic basis where we look at victoria it's now profitable uh and it can be very profitable if our membership model works and we've started expanding so we've now got uh six or seven different newsletters in different areas mostly here in canada um and we're scaling i'm i'm super excited about it so is that over story media group yeah so go ahead i it's funny we like we chose then i like the name overstory but we got cute and we were like oh overstory media group is omg and that looks cool as a logo and so we chose overstory media group but then now everyone calls it that and i hate that name but i really like overstory okay overstory so overstory is the parent company that owns capital daily yeah dude it looks like you have like 50 people working there yeah we've we've scaled a lot over the last little bit are these almost like a big bet yeah these are all pretty much all full-time people how much did you invest to start this business uh i think at this point i've probably spent two just over 2 million bucks but you have to remember that probably the first 700k was just me me not monetizing it soon enough and just focusing on building the audience first so i think we probably spent 200 250k in ads and then we probably burned an unnecessary 500k like hiring the wrong people and kind of like experimenting so really like at this point we have the biggest news business in my city for probably 750 to a million um and i think that business can probably at scale probably do 500 to a million in profit once we're actually like going so i feel pretty good about it but now we're taking this bigger bet that you know we can basically roll out local news across canada and farhan is your coach he's like the the co-founder yeah and so you attracted him because you go i'll put up the money if you run it exactly like i said look i've already kind of got this thing i've proven the model out and uh you know he was looking for his next thing and it was one of those things you know when you just meet someone and you go oh my god i want to do business with this person and they just have the right background like he'd done he'd spent like five ten years doing the exact thing that i needed um so it's a total no-brainer dude i feel like this is a much bigger deal than you're making it seem yeah it's pretty crazy what it's become and it's you know it goes back to i have in total uh i spend a lot more time on this business than the others because it's like a passion project and i'm a consumer of it right i read it every morning and i give them feedback uh and i think i annoy farhan with like daily texts about it but um i've only really spent a few probably less than a week of time on this and the key leverage point has just been uh bringing farhan on board because when farhan joined it was just a single newsletter with like three employees um so now i mean he's gone out and basically said look like axios down in the states is aggressively expanding their local and i think that's because it's gonna work and it can be profitable let's go do the exact same thing in canada and so you're gonna hope how's the story gonna end do you think i don't know i mean i think that if it's true in victoria it's probably true in a lot of other places um the interesting thing is trying to figure out like you know what topics people really want to hear and are they really variable city by city right so for example like we expanded into langford which is a suburb suburb here and it's more working class and so it's figuring out okay you know what are those people want to hear uh versus somebody who lives you know in in victoria or in vancouver do they want different topics like you know just that kind of stuff i think is going to be really interesting to figure out and what's your membership your subscription going to be uh we haven't announced it yet but we're kind of thinking about like somewhere between 100 and 200 a year uh getting local discounts access to events maybe like a member-only newsletter uh and extra content and stuff one of the things i really want to do is start hosting events in person because like as you know it's one thing to see a number of like oh the hustle has a million uh million subscribers but when you meet up with people in person it's crazy so i'm really excited to like fill a room with all the subscribers and just see what that feels like yeah me and sean are going to miami we just posted about it and we got um like 300 people signed up great uh um so yeah wow this is amazing i can't believe you didn't ask me to be part of this dude so frustrated maybe i maybe i will i i'm i have it's all just my own money at this point so if i decide i gotta go big i'll definitely hit you up i'm very interested you gotta make me an advisor i think this is gonna be sick um all right you wanna talk about another idea so you we'll talk about the baker thing in a second what's this um which one do you wanna move to let's do the pregnancy stuff okay i think that's cool what do you want yeah this is like a business in a box this is one of those things that i would do if i had time but i don't i think it's a really good idea so um people love to spend money on their kids making their kids better smarter feeling like good parents and stuff there's all sorts of like you know baby emotes are you know different uh health things people do for their kids but nobody really thinks about health during pregnancy and i think this is something that's really important that's totally overlooked my son was born early he was born like three weeks early and low birth weight and he's fine like we haven't had any health issues or anything but any parent who's gone through that knows it's absolutely terrifying and i started researching it a ton and i realized that there's all sorts of things that you can proactively do to ensure that you have a really healthy uh a really healthy pregnancy but then also to um like basically optimize your kid so if you think about it your kid is growing a brain and a body they get to do that once right like this is the building this is the foundation of your kid and so i started researching all this stuff i talked to a really smart friend my friend dr ronda patrick and basically i realized there's like all these studies that show that kids and mothers who have like fish and dha supplements b vitamins make sure they're not anemic and stuff it minimizes any risk of pregnancy and it also maximizes iq and general flourishing adhd all this other stuff so there's this huge in marketing the most important thing is to have a hook and the hook can be fear right how do you avoid this terrible outcome and one of the problems with doctors is when you talk to a doctor they just don't want to scare your wife during pregnancy and so they just say take vitamin d or do this thing they don't explain why and so i think explaining to mothers here's why you want to do this here's all the potential bad things you can avoid and hey you can make your kids smarter and better in the process there's a huge opportunity to basically do like roman or hymns but for maternal health so you do blood work supplements that get delivered on a schedule and it's about building like a super baby and you said you'd want to invest your own money in this that's what you said here yeah i i would love if anyone wants to do this i will 100 invest so please email me um but this is one of those things where like every three months i'm like why the hell hasn't anyone done this yet well there is a but there's a reason why you shouldn't invest in this which you've written here yeah i think it's a this is a great business for someone who's never done a business before because it's a good like launch pad business it's something that can make like you could be big but there's no competitive barrier right so you're gonna go out you're gonna do this then a bunch of people are gonna copy you and you can probably make a good living on this i don't think it has like a moat necessarily except for maybe like a brand that mothers share or something but i think there's something here have you heard of the there's this guy named um i forget his name uh joel maybe joel on writing is his blog and he says there's ben and jerry businesses and then there's um ben jerry's versus amazon is what he says he goes but ben and jerry it's like a unique interesting brand and a person can go to ice stream five days a week and try all types of different stuff and everyone can survive and the only thing that separates ben and jerry is just that it's slightly different but there's enough for everyone to succeed like you know there's a there's enough space we can all win and you can grow it pretty slowly for 100 years and it could probably last for 100 years and probably won't go away very easily but then there's like an amazon which is you can really only you really are only going to subscribe to one amazon prime and once you give your credit card to amazon save it you're probably just going to continue to use that and so with the ben and jerry business it's okay to go slow it's no big deal you don't have to raise a lot of money you can grow slower so long as you're willing to do it for 20 30 years it can get big you've got to get huge really fast um because everyone can copy you it's kind of like rome's and him there's a reason why like there was like five right away because someone saw it oh hurry up copy it you could spit this [ __ ] up in three weeks but him the only moat here is size it's literally a form if you think about what hymns is the original website was a well-designed site they put some like they find some stock images that are hip of like pill bottles they add their logo onto it so it looks like it's a special thing and then they literally have like a form you fill out and then a doctor just goes yeah rubber stamp okay i'll do it i'll send the prescription or whatever and they've gotten way more sophisticated but at the end of the day there's no lock-in other than the fact that i happen to subscribe with them and so other people just go out and you end up basically competing in to whatever the cost of the ads is if it costs two bucks to convert someone then you can make five cents per right and that's what happens with these businesses but i think for a year or two you could probably make a lot of money we first started this i said we should break this up into two i actually think we should break it up and we should keep it as one and because you have to go with the 10 minutes past right yeah something around about about 115. so you have this thing called what is enough money i 100 want to talk about that so let's talk about one more one more idea um and then we can come back you andrew has a huge list of ideas we'll save these and and do it for the next one but what um which other idea do you want to go to yeah this one's really this is a really weird story but so my whole life i could never burp um so my brother would like burp in my face and i'd be like what the hell how do i do that i just couldn't it was really really bizarre and you know i'd drink like pop and i'd feel bloated and crappy and i couldn't burp but it wasn't a big deal i didn't think much of it and uh and then when i was about 23 or 24 i started getting this weird acid reflux and i just get this shitty feeling of pressure and then acid reflux and it started happening day after day after day and it started driving me absolutely crazy and so about seven or eight years ago i started researching it and i knew nothing about health i knew nothing about diet and i just basically had to figure everything out myself and i tried everything i tried drugs supplements i had like you know stuff you know surgeries where they stick stuff down your throat and put cameras down there i had a wire put down my throat to check on my stomach acid i did acupuncture like everything and nothing worked and finally after seven years of researching this i was on google and i i thought about this burping thing and i was like i wonder if it's that and i found this reddit community called no burp oh there's this huge community of people who also can't burp and on that community there was somebody and they said look there's this doctor in chicago and he injects botox into the cricopharyngeal muscle in your throat and it allows you to burp and so basically the reason why people can't burp is they have this weird muscle that's too tight so i flew down chicago about six months ago and i got this injection and now i can burp and i don't get acid reflux anymore and my life is literally like 25 better i'm happier like this was actually driving me insane what was your first burp like was it like have you seen how the colorblind people put these glasses on and they could see colors or when basically i actually put it on twitter i put it on twitter i'll find it for you and we can share it in the show notes there's a video of me burping it sounded it sounds insane too right like i just like yeah it's like one of those videos where the dog gets home and hasn't seen the owner for four years like i'm just like i'm very emotional but uh it sounds effed up now i can burp like a normal person do you have 35 years of gas built up dude literally like i didn't know i didn't know what it was like to just feel like release right i just always had pressure so so anyway so i would have spent a lot of money a lot of money to figure this out and i tried all sorts of stuff i looked at like can i go to the mayo clinic like whatever and the problem is that the medical industry is just very fractured so everyone does one very specific thing and there's no one that brings it all together and most gps you know they are primary physicians they can help you but they're not going to go deep on an issue and really spend time on this and so i think there's an interesting business opportunity i don't know how big it is but this idea of a medical advocate this is basically a project manager for your problem so you'd say like i have diabetes or i have a rare condition or i have this symptom and they're going to go to every doctor's appointment they're going to get you into the best specialist they're going to push the doctors to do testing they're going to look at all the outcomes all the data read all the papers and i think this is the sort of thing that wealthy people specifically would pay a lot of money and especially if you could make it outcome based where you say if i cure this for you what's it worth to you i think this could be actually a pretty big business so two things the first have you heard of a concierge doctor yes so i have that uh basically i pay of and and i have it because someone like got it for me when i was like really ill um this billionaire lady it was a crazy story that i'll tell another time but basically i um have this doctor named dr horowitz and i just text him i go hey dr horowitz um my achilles really hurts me can you schedule an mri for me or something like that uh and he's like yeah i think an mri would be good i'll hook it up so they you know and i paid an annual fee for it 25 000 and um would that not be this well it i think that's very i have that as well but i think it's very driven by whatever you want right so you text them you say you want an mri but if you say hey my back is hurting the question is is he going to be able to have time to spend four hours a day researching your back specifically and figure that out for you is he going to have time to go to all the doctors appointments and interact with all the specialists and negotiate with them and everything that's what i'm looking for is like someone to be in the room to solve problems because i think a lot of people have like a a loved one gets cancer and they're like well how do i navigate this like what's the optimal treatment what am i missing am i talking to the wrong doctor like what advice is bad etc kind of like um a health a health manager totally specifically around an issue or like you could do it around specific issues but i think i think it's kind of like a a weird niche i recently heard about a business where all they did was negotiate uh bills for hospitals and it was a like a a very small number of people and this business made an absolute killing and that kind of turned me on to these niche medical areas did you um look into the there's this thing called a mayo clinic um executive what's it called a mayo clinic executive i forget exactly what it's called but have you seen this where you pay uh executive health program you pay ten thousand dollars and you go to a mayo clinic and they have like five of them or six of them and you basically spend two days i think or three days and they look at everything of your body and try to diagnose anything i mean have you seen this yeah i looked at doing that and what did you why didn't you well i started looking into it and what i realized is that they were just gonna recommend the same thing that i already looked at right when i talked to i think i talked to a doctor and he said oh yeah you're probably gonna have to have this special surgery which is like they they do like a surgery on your throat to close it off from acid and i'm like holy crap thank god i didn't do that that has like a million knock-on effects and all sorts of issues why wouldn't this work well i think the hard part would be is it insured maybe not so you're paying out-of-pocket how many people really want this is this just something like some rich people want or is this a real opportunity and then also like just how much can you charge for it um i think it could be a great business for one person it could be a great business for 10 people maybe it can scale i don't know i like personally i like the pregnancy health one more but i think the other one is more just something that's needed especially around if you specialized in like cancer or something so it's like when your dad gets diagnosed with cancer there's like a clear person to talk to who's like an advisor who's impartial can we um i'm just going through this i think it's interesting i think that this is it's i sometimes i'm partial to these like rich people ideas aren't you like i'm like i'm like it's cool but i don't know if i want to do that i think it's it's one of those things that is probably a business but it goes back to like we have a warped view of it it go and you know we'll talk about the enough money stuff later but i think the interesting thing that seems to happen the theme i see with people who make good amounts of money and become comfortable is they just make themselves uncomfortable again by obsessing over all the stuff that can go wrong like getting you know health issues car accidents you know how can how can it all get taken away exactly um let's talk about that so you wrote something here that immediately caught my eye and it's something that i've been reading over and over again is called what is enough money and we you and i talked about this recently basically i told you the goal when i started the hustle was by around 30. i wanted to make enough money that right up front like my nut would very passively spit off fifty thousand dollars a month in perpetuity so 50k or the equivalent with uh including inflation every single month forever and to do that you need like you want like between two to three percent of your portfolio to be able to do that so what's i don't know what whatever that do that math that's that minimum but that was my goal and yeah i mean i i i did it um and you started talking to me about what is enough money so what were you gonna say here yeah i mean i i loved you came back to me and you just said like to me enough money is like 25 to 50k a month in perpetuity with very little i said 50. and the reason i said 50 is i spend way less than that but i wanted to be incredibly conservative yeah so you'd go on a vacation and be crazy and not worry about it yeah or i think that's the right that's the right way to think about it i think the problem is a lot of people go i want to be a billionaire or whatever and it's like what do you really want it's like well i really just want to be able to like do whatever i want every month and let's be honest 50k a month even 25k a month is enough to do whatever you want for the rest of your life and so people often will ask me like oh what do you know what do you aspire to be or who do you admire most and i think like money is like i i use the athle like the athlete thing the example before of like olympic athletes i think like billionaires are like olympic athletes but let's be real olympic athletes many of them have no personal life because all they do is train and they destroy their bodies by the time they're 45 right and so the people i actually really admire i admire those sorry i admire i'm impressed by those people i love their dedication i love that they do that but i don't know if i personally want to work that hard or become an olympian i think what i aspire to be is to be the casual tennis player who is always challenging themselves loves playing plays with friends all that kind of stuff and so if you think about it from that perspective um the people i'm jealous of are the people who have 10 to 25 million dollars in a conservative passive investment they've paid off their house and they're just set and they have a great balanced lifestyle um i i love that kind of stuff and i don't know if i'm i think i'm too much of a maniac i think like i'm too anxious and i always want to do more and more and more i have a lot of fun with that but so it's hard for me to stop but those are the people that i'm jealous of there's a lot to unpack there first of all if you're jealous why don't you do that that's a good question i just don't think my personality is is really suited for that right i i always i always want as soon as i have like freedom i fill myself up again right and i'm trying to crack that right now of like what's driving that is that fear is it anxiety is it just that i love doing this i don't know i mean it's easy i got the same thing it's insecurity um like you want to it's all it's rooted in a fear of am i good enough to do like i want to com and it's ego as well i think it's it's i have to prove that i'm better than bill ackman or whoever it is like you're at this i don't i don't have that no i don't i don't feel that what i feel is like it's more it's more fun new things and what i've realized about kovit is like i hated working this year because all it was was the work what i actually love is just like meeting new people right it's like it's just an excuse to like meet new people and solve fun problems i know that sounds very kumbaya but for me it's very true without i all this work and all this more stuff is meaningless to me if i'm not like hanging out with cool interesting people and learning new things and making new friends that's all i care about and so like starting the news business even like that was an opportunity for me to be like oh who are journalists i get to you know get to know journalists who live in this whole other world outside of business where they care about totally different things and i can like nerd out on this new topic and make a whole group of new friends what would happen if you just turned off your phone or changed your phone number and not opened your computer ever again and never read your email or for like a year what do you think would happen if you did that and you came back to tiny i think i'd be fine right we just did this at tiny we changed we don't get monthly reports anymore from the ceos so like there's businesses where i don't i haven't even talked to the ceo for like three or four months i don't even know what their numbers are and what we've realized is that when you leave people alone and trust them usually good things happen and the more involved we get the worse the businesses do you have a cool quote here most successful people are just walking anxiety disorders harnessed for productivity um i completely agree i think there's this um i have some a friend was telling me about this book i'm gonna read but basically they said something like a lot of great leaders um who we look up to have horrible personality disorders you know or portable um flaws so for example jfk um was was addicted to a painkiller because he was he had a lot of issues and he was addicted to drugs um abe lincoln um he tried to kill himself a couple times and he was very suicidal and he had horrible depression same with theodore roosevelt horrible depression his wife and his newborn daughter died on the same day uh he had a he was very sad and but these types of personalities are really good during wartime um they're good because it gives them they're like a dog that has to chase a car and they feel comfortable in that in that mode and when i see you saying that you have to do the next thing and also that successful people are a walking dis anxiety disorder i agree with you i think that that is true but then i also say to myself then why would i feel bad about chasing things all the time um like why would i say like well the most successful people are just like 10 to 20 years sitting and and i just feel guilty about wanting to do [ __ ] all the time i'm like well because i'm just a guy and i'm built to go and do this [ __ ] because of how my brain is built and that is just who i am and i will not feel guilty for that yeah you're like a golden retriever and you like to chase balls and nothing is gonna change that in your brain unless maybe you take like some drug or something like that yeah so i don't think it's i don't know if it's bad but it's more like the you know i envy the people who can slow down but i don't necessarily know that i want that i don't know if i could deal with that right like i love my ideal day is actually like meeting a whole bunch of people and looking at a bunch of problems and looking at a bunch of different businesses as well as family and friends and exercise but if you take away the work part i don't really do very well i kind of need three four hours of work every single day and uh so i think there's just this natural yin and yang of like you know i over get overwhelmed and then i scale down and then i have white space and then i immediately scale back up because i'm like oh i have white space i can do more stuff what about um this photo booth business so that i was going to talk about like someone who i really admire and this is just this is genius so i met this guy probably five or six years ago uh really interesting local serial entrepreneur and um he has this business that's a passport photo booth right and in victoria there's a passport office it's in the mall there's only one of them he has the passport photo office right outside or sorry the passport photo place right outside the canadian passport thing so as people walk in and they go oh [ __ ] i need a passport photo he's got the booth right there right and i was just like that is a freaking amazing business it spits out like i don't know how much but you know a good life for him and it just creates this base for him and i was like that's the ultimate and this guy he has like three or four businesses um but he also just like mountain bikes and surfs all the time and seems to like do whatever he wants right this guy and he's always giving me [ __ ] being like dude come surfing with me like why aren't you enjoying life and stuff um and uh really really interesting guy but it's just an example of like the kind of people who i'm like oh you've like you've hacked it you've figured it out you've got enough and you're always doing enough interesting stuff that you're active but you also find time to do like whatever the hell you want for three four hours a day so why do you have a personal scorecard but what is this uh so chris and i like i would say kovid like hit us super hard over the winter we were so busy we took that company public like it was just an exhausting year and we were like we need a personal scorecard to do we try and do this like once a month or so where we just sit down and ask ourselves these questions and if enough of them are negative then we'll be like okay we gotta change something so some of them are like um you know when you're with your kids are you present are you taking your kids out for one on ones at least twice a month have you had any calls in the last week that you would just not want to do have you had more than two hours of calendar scheduled time per day are you reading interesting books you pre proud of your body you know just like basic stuff that encompasses your life and it's been really really interesting and useful to just force yourself to ask those questions because so often the answers are no looking at this so whenever you come on you send me this huge document this document i contributed a little bit to it but a lot of it's yours it's 2 000 words did you write this what the hell are you serious it's 18 it's 18 or 19. jesus that's crazy did you write this yeah yeah i i didn't write the the research on the billy of the week but i wrote the rest that's crazy yeah so we're gonna save this and we're gonna have to come back and talk about it all because we also asked people on twitter so we got a bunch of questions about meta lab uh building a meta lab in india of course we got tons of newsletter questions we got tons of tax questions which is kind of an interesting one and then of course we get the same question of like what would you do if you started now um we'll we'll actually answer them next time so hopefully we can record on tuesday i don't know if you're available but uh when your episodes are some of the most popular um this month we're gonna cross six hundred thousand downloads and uh you're a big part of that thank you this is fun i always love having you here because i feel like when we talk i'm more of a fan than a co-host dude i just love coming on because it's not like you guys have such a unique format and it's so awesome to see you guys actually like getting huge right like i feel like i i remember listening to you guys like two years ago and you're like my only podcast subscription basically so it's awesome to see you getting so big it's wicked yeah last week we were ranked 14. the goal by the end of the year was top 10. i think that we're cracking the code i think there's a world where when you think of like business podcasts it will be like of course like jocko because he's like up there it'll be tim ferriss because he's been the best for a while and then there's guy razz he's been the best for a while but i think there's a world where we're going to be up there um in a very short amount of time and i'm excited for that and you're part of it so like as we as our podcast gets bigger because you're the most popular guest so are you awesome no i i love doing these it's so fun uh thank you dude well let's do yeah next week let's do an ama or whatever and yeah we'll do that we should get sean on and do do a full-on ama we're gonna i'm gonna ask him his baby's just now

something like that he's the one with the billions house yeah so i'm gonna fly to his house tonight and i'm gonna interview andrew from new york tomorrow but um june 3rd sean and i and a bunch of people on my team are going to be in austin we're doing a live event um i think it was sold out like right away but yeah we're going to see what we can do um and then the next we should do we should do something else uh because it sold out so quick if there are more people who want to do it we should uh i don't know let's capture their info somehow and let's just do like i don't know a hangout we'll just i don't know let's go to a park where let's go wherever i know we may not have a venue but uh let's meet and greet some people who want to hang out or something i don't know let's do something let's go to a bar who cares and then the next day we're going to do miami so we got june 3rd austin june 4th miami if people want to attend austin's already sold out but there is an event right for it miami we're putting up the event right yeah and that one can seat 150 people so that'd be cool if we sell it out but maybe we won't who knows so it should have plenty of room last thing we've got some cool by the way on the pod we shouted out we said mayor suarez to the mayor of miami we said if you're listening to this we need a venue we need blah blah he replied on twitter he goes i got you let's talk and then somebody else came through it was just like here's the venue what i don't know if we want to shout out their name somebody hooked us up um with a sweet video no we'll hook them up we'll shout them out next time because i've asked them exactly what they want us to shout out gotcha so uh i'll i've already asked some last things all right we got a couple guests coming up um the first one mark lore so marklor started jet.com which he sold for billions i think three billion i think um so that guy's cool uh and he started something before that i think it was at diapers.com yep and he just bought amazon he just bought the timberwolves uh nba basketball mba dude i'm such a dork i don't even know yeah with with a-rod bought the timberwolves and then we have uh mike maples coming on who people probably don't know but he's a pretty big name um bc and he's uh funded a lot of a ton of star stuff that you all know yeah and then finally bill smith this name generic name but do you know who bill smith is he you love this guy dude you are this is like your new your new obsession is bill smith yeah i'm gonna tell you why so he started like a uh like a credit card company in his 20s and he sold it right away for millions of dollars then his second hit was starting [ __ ] so shipt was based out of alabama it was basically very similar to instacart but uh he self-funded it and then he sold it for like 600 million dollars now he's got another thing and the guy's only like 33. he's got another thing called hello landing that i think is really badass so that guy's coming on soon but that's the updates we just hired this guy yesterday um what's his name brayu dan dan off to a great start yeah i think it's um dan i think kerner is his last name i don't need to try we here at the hustle have a tremendous culture we really care about our people dude after you're hired we find out your name and after that we [Laughter] do you know you want to hear something funny you know sieva yes one of my best friends probably like one of your closest friends i've known no he's my best friend dude well i've known him for 10 years almost i couldn't tell you how to say his last name yeah see because this is a key save a russian name so i don't think it's important to sam what's my last name [Music] i have no idea what's his first name well android but i don't know how to say it definitely called him a brew for a while i just don't think you need to know someone's name i mean i try really hard to remember people's name i hate when people say i'm bad at remembering names so i always try to remember someone's first name but i don't think you need to know someone's name really to like know them well i'll just call them bob or chief [Laughter] those are the two bub cheeks uh all right you have something in your hand what is that that's an idea is that a stress ball all right i didn't know you could see this no it's just chapstick i'm just trying to put chapstick on uh are stress balls still a thing i remember when i was a kid i went to my mom's office and her and every other person had a stress ball on their uh on their desk and now that i think about it i haven't seen one of these in like 10 years and what a great idea what a genius name and invention to just be like how do i sell this like five cent item to every worker in a cubicle in america oh let me call it the stress ball let me tell you that this gets rid of your stress and just make it kind of fun to fiddle with and play with why aren't more people doing that right we have fidget spinner for kids we need the stress spinner for adults i need i want to invent the next little silly putty gadget thing that you feel addicted to playing with on your desk good luck i mean if anyone's gonna be able to do it it's gonna be you um i had these things on my desk uh that i used to fiddle with i think it annoyed everybody because it kind of made a little bit of a sound but um that's who i am at work i breathe loud i chew i eat at my desk uh you know i'm i'm that guy you hate at the office so i had this thing there's like these magnetic there's like a little magnetic um [Music] toy or something i don't know what it was there's a bunch of like tiny little blocks that are magnetic so they stick together and then you just whatever you whatever shape you put them in it just like sticks in that shape or you can pull them apart and stick them back together like a magnet and these things are so addictive they weren't for playing with at your desk but they're really effective so uh maybe maybe it will come out with a line by the way i'm i've kick-started a task to make us dope merch um not to make money but uh because i just want to wear our own stuff and i figured out the first two first two items that we need to have in our merch well the first one is easy that one's a notebook so like the joke that we get in the comments which is like you know don't listen while driving because you want to take notes you'll crash yeah we are known to be more dangerous than drinking while driving so it's actually in several states it's outlawed i hope a notebook is one of the two a notebook okay notebook is one and that's actually in motion so i um for the course i'm making i found this illustrator giannis who's amazing i put out this tweet i said who's the next jack butcher and then i got a bunch of reply i found this guy he's amazing um you know don't tell jack but i think his stuff might be better than jax you know jack's more clever but this guy's actual illustrations are amazing i told him i said hey i've been using this thing called the self journal or something like that for a long time um i think the founder of that listens to the pod um i forgot do you know her name catherine yeah um great product and uh yeah we should come up with a limited edition notebook thing so i got that in motion i'll run it by you but the the merge stuff that i was thinking about was when biology came on and we were trying to beat around the bush and be like so you're like super rich right right and then he was like yeah the most humble way possible was like i'm post economic and then i was like oh [ __ ] that is that is it that is the best phrase so now i'm getting hoodies made that just say post economic and uh you know those will go out to anybody who wants to buy a post economic goody so that's the best one that's a good one and is that the so notebook uh the other one that i was thinking about you know how we have our harvard shirts um because we visited the campus yeah uh so i think i might sell some bootleg harvard merch before they shut me down and all it is is it's harvard yeah i've been there uh or like you know love that campus or yeah was there an o4 uh like harvard 04 and on the back it says you know like tours um so maybe a harvard one but the the real one that i want to make there is you know the like kind of like like take the harvard style of a sweater sweatshirt or sweater where it kind of looks like you know you're a scholar right i went to this school that's where i learned that's where i got my education that but it's just gonna say the internet it's just gonna say internet um or say youtube because that's where i learned everything and uh there's a lot of other people that are you're like that too or everything you learned was just through the internet that's that's who we should really be giving credit to for our education so i'm going to make a university-looking piece of apparel that's just either calling out the internet or youtube or twitter or something i think the post-economic thing will make money well it has to that's by definition um all right so so anyways let's talk about canva for video or do you want to talk about super joints no let's do a canvas video so um so stole this idea from my buddy suli he tweeted this out he said who's creating canva video and i've had the same idea so if you don't use canva you're probably not gonna fully understand this idea not just because the metaphor but you're gonna be like when i describe it you can be like that sounds simple like because i'm sure there's stuff like that that exists no there's not so canva why don't you give the download canva i'll talk about why canva for video needs to exist yeah canva was started in australia at this point it's maybe eight years old uh i i went and did some research there they have 15 billion evaluation 500 million dollars in revenue and what's cool is that this ceo i think her name is melanie this woman named melanie she's like a superstar you hear her talk and you're like oh i will whatever you say i'm in her husband are the two co-founders which is pretty badass because collectively they own 30 of the company even though it's had a 15 billion dollar evaluation so they crushed it but basically the product is uh you can make really simple images so a lot of times people use google slides like i do and you like put an image on there and then you could write some text on there and you stick a screenshot and tweet that with canva it's all a little bit more intuitive and you can make really really simple uh like uh good-looking designs good looking design it's like photoshop for uh eight-year-old like me yes photoshop for people who don't know photoshop that's the best way of describing it so before when you wanted to make a marketing brochure a flyer for your event um you know a instagram ad a whatever any kind of image or graphic to go alongside your product or your event or whatever it is you would be like great let me ask my designer friend to make one or let me go into like you know paint or one of these you know google slides or powerpoint or whatever and try to make one myself and it always came out looking budget like you made it yourself or you had to overpay somebody who knows photoshop who has graphic design skills who knows that this should go at this angle and that this is a cool way to do a collage and like to do a mask and whatever so what they did was they just created this enormous library of templates so you go on there and you say great i want to make an ad for a sale well guess what a lot of people have that problem and so what they did was they just created or surfaced hundreds of templates of sale you know how to present a sale if you're a store so now i don't need a designer i just go in there myself i change the text i drop my image into where their image is and it's like nicely cut into a circle automatically or it removes the background automatically without you having to know how to do that with the magic wand in photoshop so um so that's what canva does it's amazing it's grown like crazy like you said 500 million in revenue done very well i think it went public not long ago so canva does that for images and they kind of have some like animation stuff but nobody has done this for simple videos so i'm talking about the whole world has moved to video rather it's long form like netflix medium form like youtube short form like tick tock even shorter form like a facebook ad or an instagram ad and it still requires people who know how to edit video in order to make a simple video and uh and that's crazy to me and so there's people who've tried to attack this from many angles i would say that what a lot of people try to do is they try to make figma for video which is like they take imovie and they say no it should be in the cloud you should be able to have multiple people using it at once you see each person's mouse moving around the screen and it saves it all the cloud blah blah no i think you need canva i think you need off-the-shelf ready-made video like short video clips that you just swap and replace your text and your images or your video clips into those and um there's some things like this that exist but nobody has cracked this nut i think canvas most likely to do and i'm sure they think about this all the time you know they're it's not like they're listening to this and saying oh my god genius we never thought about video right but like i do think it's a gnarly problem and i think if you are focused on this you can outflank a lot of people just by finding the right library of of templates and then getting the the ux right where you can make it easy to swap out text and images with your own stuff so i think that this might be a great idea but i'll i'm going to default to pessimism just for the sake of argument i think that there's a few reasons why this would be really hard the first reason is that well this is actually the the main reason which is more people use videos uh use image based stuff and they do video based stuff so at a company most everyone would not most everyone but a very large percentage of employees would want to use uh a text-based stuff whether you're making just a silly graphic for an internal email whether you're making a sign that says happy birthday for your employees all the way up so you're making the social post so you're mocking up a website yadda yadda um by the way someone made fun of me for saying yada yada i'm not gonna say it anymore uh but anyway uh there's like so many different instances of that right is there actually um that many people that would huge need dude yes okay it's the internet text is massive images is massive video is massive they're all messed up how many people write words on facebook and twitter then make videos on youtube like but it's a business it's a business use case so if you're a business um you need to be doing all three you need to be creating text content you need to be creating image content and you create video content and you do them at different times the video content is often the one that you need that's the highest value to you and it works the best in terms of getting getting people's attention and so there are tools to do this i shouldn't say that there's not right promo.com is uh one of them so promo.com it has a bunch of templates to let you do videos i've used it it is good it is probably the closest thing to canvas video there's a startup called motionbox.io they're doing this it looks pretty cool i haven't i haven't actually had a chance to play with it yet um cap wing is a big one i've heard of that one really popular it's that one's more from memes so they made it really easy to make video memes um we talked about pinata farms also to make video memes when i uh when i was moving out of san francisco the guy i posted on twitter that i was selling my gym and the founder weren't coming try to come and buy all my gym equipment that's how i met kaplan the founder of which one kaplan yeah nice that's great so i think so here's my take of what's the opportunity here the opportunity here for me is i should be going to try to invest in all of these companies i think they are all like this space is going to be big these are all viable companies they're all at different stages i'm going to go try to put a check into all of these because i'm such a big believer in that space really but the other thing yes for sure um the other thing is if you're building how would you differentiate i think one of the ways to differentiate the one i would do is i would focus on facebook ads i've talked about this before but if you think about facebook's one of the largest companies because it makes a ton of revenue um what how does it make its revenue from advertising who's advertising you know hundreds of thousands if not millions of of um of businesses that advertise on facebook and if you can do things to help them advertise either save them time or make their ads better you're going to make money on either one of those two axes and i've found that facebook ad tech is sort of of course there's companies in that space but there's much less than you would think there's a lot of people that build um that try to build on top of platforms and i think that the facebook ad platform is a great place to build products because if you make someone's life better you are making them or saving them a lot of money and uh so it's not hard to capture you know your hundred dollars a month if you're able to do that yeah i think it's cool i think that there's a there's a i'm gonna i'm just gonna default to bad stuff because that's the dynamic we're taking right now but uh the um dude selling stuff for 200 a year that software is so freaking hard so go to um are you on your computer right now are you on your phone yeah computer all right google buffer revenue okay so buffer is this awesome company i mean it's kind of awesome and they're one of the first people that made famous sharing their revenue so if you're listening out there type in on google buffer revenue and you're going to be taken to a i don't know what the the platform's called but it's some type of platform where you could show all their revenue what's their revenue look like sean so this post that was 2019 late 2019 was revenue is 21 million they have 75 000 customers um and they make a quarter million dollars per employee go to uh go to buffer.com revenue right so their current one yes uh actually this is yeah so flat lined out so that number i said 2019 that was the peak 2020 was the same 2021 is the same so still at 21 million if you're listening go to buffer.com revenue and they're going to see all their revenue it's pretty amazing it says 26 of revenue per account yeah and so what you're gonna see here's what you're gonna see the rev on this buffer thing the revenue goes up really fast and then it plateaus and that is what happens when you sell [ __ ] that costs 20 50 100 it's incredibly hard to keep going it's really hard to keep going and that happens and i i study a lot of these graphs so like there's convertkit has another one there's a lot and if you look at the metrics there's if you google like average price price price for sas there's a lot of research on where they look at companies that go public and look at how much their software costs there's this dead zone of like 200 a year or 300 a year or something like that like and it's like it's incredibly hard to build a big company when [ __ ] costs that much some people have done it mailchimp has done it um canva has done it i think it's almost impossible for most other types of people to do it well we are talking about canva for video so i'm gonna hope that it falls into that category i actually just want canva to do this because am i wrong though am i wrong you're not wrong in that um there's an effort to acquire customers it costs money and it takes time and if your size of the prize is 26 or 99 um it is very hard to get to the point you're talking about which is going public or being a multi-billion dollar no but my point though is not necessarily if you're listening to this and you want to build something that has to be the goal my but when i think about stuff sometimes i think now this isn't always but sometimes it's far easier to be a small fish in a massive market than it is to like be a big fit like you know like i i'd rather be like the shitty person in uh something that's just booming because like it'll be way easier to crush it yeah although you also say um you know niches get riches type of thing right where you'd rather be a big fish in a small pond well i i said i don't always think that way i'm saying like if i want to build something that can just make a good like living then yeah that's one thing if i want to create something that could take off i would probably want to do the other way right and i think you know the thing you just said that's important is you said a market that's booming that's different than a big market so a big market is a already big market a market that's booming is a growing market and so if i was gonna rank the three i would say small fish in a booming market then big fish in a small market and lastly small fish in a already big market yeah i think i agree with you can we talk about super joints yeah i looked it up while you were talking and i have a lot to say about this okay well i don't even know what you looked up this was my own name of an idea i had so much super joints is do you remember so we talked about the book happy body okay okay yeah yeah yeah let's go here first super joints is also the name of a book at google super joints it looks just like the happy body yeah it looks exactly like it like 1970s or 80s like design um but we don't have to talk about that i thought well the thing i was thinking about is so my mom uh is staying with me right now she's been here for last few days and uh you know my mom has like always got some ache and pain and uh and she does a good job of like like trying to exercise and stretch and you know like whatever do the things that she can do to you know we bought a special pillow for the bed so that like kind of if she's in bed watching tv like she's not in a crappy posture or whatever we try things but this is a every aging person problem is that you know you get bad back bad knees bad hip bad shoulder whatever right like you've risked pain this stuff comes up and i started thinking like okay you know i think that you this is going to be a this is a massive massive market that nobody really is able to do much with um [Music] and so i thought what is the what is the solution i think there's two solutions i think the end solution is fixing it from the inside so that's some version of like stem cells or like regenerative therapies where you're able to um to regrow cartilage or strengthen strengthen the tendons or do something like that to reduce the the irritation inflammation um okay i don't know too much about that i don't know where we're at in the stem cell world then there's the fix it from the outside and i thought oh this might be actually easy so i was watching somebody move a couch you know my neighbor had a truck and they're moving and like you know it was one person just with a dolly just moving this like huge couch and bookcase and all this stuff and um it got me thinking like man with these simple tools that we've made that man has made you have so much leverage you can lift heavy objects why don't we just have these like as like a little knee brace that people wear that just helps you when you're trying to get up it's just like a little spring action that is like a super joint it is and it's it is a a sort of an external fix to the problem of joint pain that sounds like such an infomercial thing i can i can imagine this now in my head exactly that's exactly what i thought of my head i see the old lady sitting on the couch she's trying to get up and she's struggling and then it like fades yeah it fades to black and white and she's in pain and then it's like her again on the couch and she gets up and she just gets up effortlessly because she's got this little thing she wears around her knee that essentially like as she does this motion it's a spotter and i just thought why don't we have spotters for our own carrying our own body weight so um how do you think of this i think that that you're cool it sounds like some shitty alibaba product that you i think you're thinking about totally wrong so like what you're talking about is like a silly brace i want to like actually solve the problem and there's three companies that i've been paying attention to that are in this space um and they're all centered around mobility so what i've noticed amongst my friends and like the people in austin now is a lot of them are less focused on lifting heavy weights and more focused on um this manly version of yoga that we call mobility right right it's it's yoga i mean i'm doing mobility training yeah it's stretching yes it's a little bit more interesting than yoga and i do it a lot as well so there's three things that i like there's one called the ready state the readystate.com there's another one called i actually don't know how you pronounce it but it looks like it's uh it's go wad uh so the word go and then i think it stands for workout of the day uh i'm a paying subscriber of it it's great and then the third one is the knees over toes knees over toes guy have you seen knees over toes guy dude i'm all into this yeah i've done the whole program it's wonderful oh you did i've done the whole thing it's so good so did your vertical leap go up yeah but i yeah it all works wonderful i i love it but basically the first two that i've described so gowad and the ready state it's an app that you pay a hundred dollars and the founders of goad i've actually talked about on this podcast two years ago i think and or a year and a half ago and they messaged me and they said you're the numbers that you're it was someone who works there so the numbers that you're saying are way smaller than we actually are and i think i said they're doing half a million a month in sales um right and so they're both apps where you spend 30 minutes a day and they just do stretches it's just the simplest app ever it's just a video that shows you a stretch and it counts down from 60 seconds the other thing is this guy named knees over toes guy uh that's like his handle his knees over toes guy his name is ben patrick and he got he went viral on on on in on tick-tock and instagram i found him on instagram and it's basically this crew of guys and he's like the leader but he's they're like these quote manly men like they like they they like are strong looking and fit and all that but they um like stretch a ton and they're really focused on one-legged pistol squats and being able to touch your toes and we should say he's called knees over toes guy because in classical kind of like training anytime you train they're always like don't let your knees go over your toes because they thought that's how you get injured that's when you're doing a squat wrong or a lunge oh no you're not lunging right you want your knee to never go past your toe if you're biking they always say the same adjust your seat height so your knees doesn't go over your toes and this guy was like hey i blew out my knee i tore my acls and um and you know i started trying to figure out how do i actually strengthen my legs how do i strengthen my knees so that i don't get injured again and in fact he ended up getting stronger through his like so he did some self-experimentation and whatever and then now he's i don't know 43 45 years old he's got like a i forgot how old he is he's in his 40s or even maybe even his like maybe he's 50. that's all he's got a 43 inch vertical leap he can dunk he's like he jumps higher now than he did in his 20s and he's been athletic the whole time it's just that now he strengthens his leg in this this way that breaks all the rules so his stuff is intentionally let your knee go over your toes why because we want to stabilize our knees when they're in these uncomfortable compromised positions we'll do it in a controlled way now so that you don't get hurt later so that's the theory behind this stuff and this guy has almost 500 000 followers on twitter or on instagram and he is putting on an absolute master class in marketing i followed him and like i i because i'm a internet guy i know exactly what he's doing and i'm like it's working it's working i bought it he charges 50 a month and the reason he charges 50 a month is because the churn is probably astronomical so the average user i bet only stays for three months because when you do the program like i did i just wrote it down i'm like oh i know exactly what to do it's just like right it's as basic as a pdf um so like i know what to do but he got my 150 bucks over three months i got results i loved it and the way that this guy's getting um he's basically doing you know the best person i've ever seen at this fitness uh marketing is that woman kayla it's new i think her name is and she has it's scenes and she has an app called sweat that's scaled to 100 million dollars in sales if you're a guy you probably don't know who she is it's my wife sarah used it and she crushed it and all she did was sell pdf and then eventually it it went to an app with this guy ben from knees over toes i bet you he's doing 10 million a year in sales and he's not even he doesn't even have his own app there's all these apps called trainerize uh in similar apps where what you do is you just put your program on their thing and you give them a little tiny cut of the revenue it's a pretty amazing business i mean the high churn but like it looks like a really fun lifestyle business run totally it's uh what we were talking about with judge judy and michael buffer last episode i think it was we talked about building a personal monopoly and finding your niche uh that's what this guy did brilliant branding knees over toes guy right beautiful beautiful branding to to latch onto that it's a different it's it's sort of um i don't know if you remember but i one of my kind of core content beliefs came from the guy who writes wait but why and our actually his buddy there's two guys behind it so this is not tim urban it's the guy who who helps him with his business andrew right he was nice enough took a call from me one day and uh i said yeah i'm thinking about my content and what's the strategy what's the brand and he goes i have a really simple way of thinking about it he goes you know in the matrix we have uh morpheus reaches out and says do you want the red pill or the blue pill meaning like you want to keep living in your fantasy land if the way that you were told things are or do you want the truth that's the red pill the harsh red pill that you got to swallow and neo chooses the red pill because he wants to know the truth and he basically said that's what the best way to build your content brand is by giving people red pills um so people you know if people think one way or society tells you x i'm going to tell you the truth and here's why um and so that's what these over those guys did it's a perfect red pill uh everybody says don't move your knee over your toe i'm the knees over toes guy and so he built his niche there he built his brand there he went viral on tick tock by showing some pretty amazing stuff and then he's translating that into a business now i have a quick opportunity for somebody who wants to do this so one of the things that he does in his program you tell me you did the program uh my trainer takes pieces of the program and gives it to me but did you buy that gadget that you that you wear on your foot the monkey foot thing yeah and who did you buy that from the monkey foot guys uh it's i think it's called animal house fitness is that who you bought it from yeah and is that his brand or is that somebody else's brand it does not appear to be his but i didn't realize not his correct okay so knees over toes guy if you're listening this is for you uh or if you're not gonna do it we can pair you with a hustler who's gonna do this you need to be selling this device okay so wait yeah so the what this thing is is the boot it's like imagine a ski boot that you put on your foot you step into it and under the boot there you can put a tiny little dumbbell so you can put like a five pound 10 pound whatever 15 pound dumbbell into it and so then when you do leg extensions or calf sorry like knee raises things like that you have like weighted resistance and it helps you build strength faster and so it's one of his like core things did i miss anything on it yeah he also makes slant boards so yeah i i think that like there's an entire brand to be made around this like i i wouldn't call it masculine because i think women like this too but a non-yoga-esque uh like i would i don't want to go as far to say it's feminine but you guys get the idea like a a well it's gotten cooler because tom brady you know the greatest quarterback of all time came out with the tb12 program the town brady 12 program and people like great tom brady you're still playing you just won the super bowl last year i don't know what he is 42 43 years old this is the oldest you know quarterback to win a super bowl how are you still playing um and you know he he credits basically like he eats super clean and then he doesn't do like strength and explosive training he does all flexibility mobility pliability that's what he is those are his focuses he's like that's how i don't get hurt brother and we talked about this a year and a half ago i was all about this you were talking about the subreddit you visit right which is a mobility subreddit right yes i've been all about this the reason i'm all about this is you can feel it in your body um like i like i i do different athletic challenges and i've done challenges where i try to get incredibly strong and i know how i feel i'm like oh i feel kind of swollen i feel bloated i don't feel awesome and then i do these things where i just try to squat all the way with my butt in the ground with no weight and i'll just sit there for you know 10 minutes or i'll just work on flexibility and i'm like oh i feel so i feel alive i feel so much better and so i've been talking about this forever i just sent you an instagram a guy named the flexible that's another amazing name i love the flexi bowl you act you immediately know what it is it's a strong person that's flexible um and so anyway i'm all about this niche of i don't know what we're gonna call this like uh uh flexibility culture whatever it is i think that these things are the best i think there's a bunch of interesting things going on in this space i've seen a few people i've seen this one guy watch this thing called the human garage and they go there you go there and they stretch you so i love all these things i'm totally into them i also have seen that the tests the mobility tests go semi-viral so i saw something or i don't even know it was me or my mom i don't know one of us saw it then they shared it with the other and then everybody in the family did the test and all it was is this get up test so you sit on the ground indian style cross-legged oh sorry is indian style not pc i think it's about the native american indians so you know you might piss off two groups but uh yeah you said on the ground indian style as we used to say back in second grade and uh and then you're supposed to get up and the idea is that you i think you like for every part of your body that you have to use to touch the ground to get up you sort of deduct a point so like for me when i have when i'm sitting like that first of all i can barely even sit like that second of all if i have to get up it's like a [ __ ] process dude it's like roll to the left now i'm laying down elbow on the ground forearm on the ground hand on the ground second hand pushes me now i'm in a push-up position now i get to my knees now i stand upright i stand up like an 80 year old and the test says you're basically have the fitness of an 80 year old you have the mobility of an 80 year old because i lose it's like you start at seven points and you deduct a point for everything that touches the ground something like that and so then i did it and then my mom did it my dad did it my sister it's like everybody does it and so there's something interesting there of let's say you wanted to build a program like this or sell a tool like this there's something interesting like we talked about last time of personality tests uh iq tests horoscope tests people's most interesting subject is themselves similarly here i think you could build a following or an audience by by giving people a simple diagnostic a simple test can you like it's like the kind of can you pat your head and rub your belly at the same time it's like everybody wants to try it when they hear oh that's hard that sounds easy right um i saw one the other day that was like take your arms to the side reach them straight above your head and then like do they um like keep your arms straight so do it yeah keep your arms straight yeah so you okay you're you're not so bad but like you're tight you can see your tongue tie at my left his is like if your bicep is able to like touch your ear while maintaining the straightness and like crossing you're able to cross your hands then your shoulders are like adequately you know flex flexible and mobile and if not then you want to do these three exercises to improve that and so i love this model of sort of diagnose the problem and then prescribe your solution and uh i think that would be a cool way to kind of grow this but i'm with you that hey flexibility mobility pliability i think these are where the fitness trends are going uh right now and to wrap it up i'll say it's never been easier to make money off this type of thing this guy uh ben nisovatos guy as i said he doesn't have his own app he's using trainerize this other app you can literally launch this today today uh with 20 bucks um all right you want to talk about uh linkedin stuff or uh what do you google whatever let's do linkedin stuff so you said something the other day you go this guy lives like down my block and he created i don't even know what was it some guy who's done something cool he's built some cool business student loan hero right and you were like he lives i don't know how long he lives like that like ten doors down ten doors down all right so great so i don't know how you found that out but i'll tell you it's pretty funny i tweeted a picture of myself in front of my new house and he dm'd me and goes i don't want to be weird but i i know that house i lived on the block so that and that's a cool moment you met somebody who's like kind of professionally relevant to you that's also locally relevant to you yeah what does that mean i think that there's an opportunity to build a location-based professional network or professional networking tool especially now that the world has gone remote so you got a bunch of people relocating you have people getting out of offices where they would normally be seeing kind of like peers and co-workers and stuff like that all the time and most people think the answer is create a co-working space or some kind of like flexible work space where you go and you work and that's where you're going to get professional interaction well i've actually seen kind of this other trend which is you discovering people who live around you that are like like kind of like interesting business people that you would want to meet with and you guys kind of both opted in to be who are you learning this from well i'm saying i had a similar experience the other day did a call guys like where do you live i said oh i live in this this little place right outside uh san francisco he goes oh my friend just moved there or my friend lives there too he's the you know chief prada officer at blankety blank company which kind of i was like oh sick uh well i don't want to get out of his identity or whatever but like a company don't worry about it it's kind of like a well-known company he's like oh yeah he lives out there too i was like great uh i'll intro you guys you guys should hang out because like it's like oh like you know we're sort of like we could be friends and we live near each other so that's the excuse of why we might actually hang out so i thought that's kind of interesting what if you could get people to basically just say here's my job and here's where i live or here's where i where i am and it just notifies you about other people that are also there that are kind of like professionally relevant to you if you could kind of figure out people's like i don't know without being a douche but like if there's a ceo you kind of want to talk to other like c c levels serious guy yeah not like the product manager or some other company that's not like super relevant to you um so i think that would be kind of cool as a way to as a cool product to bootstrap a new style of professional network and a new style of interaction and first of all let's even mention that linkedin freaking everyone says the same thing linkedin sucks how does everyone use linkedin and yet we all use it or a lot of people do i don't use it anymore but you get the idea yeah it's it is used and it is still the number one even though we all say how much it sucks um and i think it's true what i think that what that what i think that it means is you have to find an angle that's not a direct angle you can't beat linkedin by just building linkedin again and being like but i have better features i have better design that's not going to work so the best angle so every time all right i see so many companies that are trying to beat linkedin and i think it's a worthy thing to try to do i think because i think it can be done and i think that you can build a big business and if you can't un bundle them or whatever crush them you could do pretty good and the only times i've seen people do it that seems any traction is they divide it up into subgroups so it's typically race and it's typically gender um i think or it could be industry like angellist did it with startups angelus basically took the whole startup company's jobs and candidates off of range off of linkedin and just said that we can do this better i've never seen it done really with industries i don't agree with your i don't totally agree with that assessment because kind you're kind of right yeah i guess you are right but i do i haven't seen many i've seen a ton of women tips uh women focused ones so there's girl boss there's this other one called levo i think it was called l-e-v-o uh like also girl boss failed right so yeah to be fair yeah yeah yeah but there's chief chief.com which i have no idea if it's succeeding or not but it certainly seems like it is there's um and there's a lot of black focused ones i don't remember all their names but i remember seeing them float around and they seemed mildly successful like they have some traction but obviously i'm not a user um but i've seen race and gender linkedin so here's the ones that i think have worked i think angellist worked right through three to four billion dollar company and if i'm a startup uh i might have a linkedin but i'm i i well with all of my startups i've found better luck finding jobs and candidates through angelus um dribble did this yeah so dribble was like uh if you're a designer linkedin's kind of like it's hard to show that you're a good designer there i would say uh behance did it better than triple because they had 175 million exit yeah so so designed let's just say where you're putting your portfolio up there you're networking with other designers and then other people can come find they find images and then they say who's who made this and then they basically hire you right so i think that was kind of that was kind of successful git github github for developers exactly that's another one and then there's the low end where it's like upwork right where it's just like they went you know kind of like geography like you were saying and upwork basically says here's a way to find you know workers can find jobs and jobs can find workers um but we're gonna go for like kind of like outsourced labor arbitrage type of thing so i think those have all worked now here's a different like take here's what here's a company i invested in that i think has a cool chance of beating linkedin i want to describe their strategy but i don't want to use the silicon valley jargon you know this word orthogonal no have you heard people say this that it's like yeah you have to take an orthogonal angle or it's an orthogonal or well orwellian no it just means like you don't go directly like you don't beat linkedin like okay here's the example let's say you think um powerpoint sucks you're like i'm gonna build a better powerpoint the way to build a better powerpoint is not to make slides that are easier to make it's to look at the fact that people use slides to give their bosses presentations about how like how the business is doing and actually the orthogonal way to attack that is to build dashboards that automate them that are always automatically updated that your boss can just check and now you don't even need slides right right like in order to build a vulnerability to build the best hotel business you don't create better hotels necessarily you get other people to list their homes you get airbnb exactly so so orthogonal just means sort of attacking it from another angle so here's here's an orthogonal uh attack on linkedin there's this company called palette.xyz have you seen this palette how do i spell it palette p p a l l e t uh dot x y z i think that's the name you're not gonna learn too much from this but i'll tell you kind of like where you could see how did you find these guys dude how do you find all this [ __ ] man bro you i've already given people the the the secret sauce which is be super curious and then surround yourself with interesting people and then share it right like my my crew i think ben found palette or maybe zach found palette i'm not sure somebody's fun palette i talked to the guy behind it he's awesome he's like a 23 year old ex stanford guy like you just talked to him you're like oh okay you're going to win like it's whether it's this business or the next one or the next one or the next one like you're gonna win you're clearly super smart you're way ahead of your time in terms of just like polish as a ceo and you're an engineer and you recruited under other good engineers great um but what he's building is actually pretty cool we found him because um i am pretty interested in like what i'm calling like kind of like the creator stack or basically like the solopreneur's playbook so i look at people like pomp right pomp is uh a creator he creates content in the niche of crypto you can say who pomp is i actually don't think everyone knows okay pop his name's anthony pompliano he's uh kind of like a friend of ours we don't know him super well but he's friendly he's come on the pod we've been on his pod and he's super well known he used to work at facebook then he was like i don't know chief something at snapchat left really early or like kind of like that didn't last very long went on his own and started creating content about bitcoin in like 2016 2017-ish and as bitcoin got more popular he got more popular so he's got like i don't know a million followers now he's got a sub stack with 170 000 you know like subscribers or paid subscribers he's a bitcoin media personality but like he's on cnbc to talk big anytime bitcoin happens pump tell us is it good or is it bad yeah he's kind of a troll on purpose like i like pomp but he like he like uh [ __ ] the people i don't call him a troll i think he's um somebody said this and they said it in a way that was derogatory but i actually think it's like a good description of like people like this they called him a carnival barker which is basically like a hype man like somebody who's going to just keep keep pounding the pavement and keep keep knocking on doors and saying saying the message i don't mean disrespectfully i mean like he's funny like he's like he's a [ __ ] yeah and he has a good time he's got a good personality and he's extremely talented with content creation and branding so we'll talk about one of his other projects that just came out but anyways my point is uh pomp created this uh job board called crypto jobs or something like that like uh he's like you want a job in crypto and he you're i'm a trusted guy in crypto if you want to work in crypto here's my personal job board i thought oh that's kind of interesting like we've talked in the past about job boards andrew wilkinson talked about how good of a business job boards are and um i thought i wonder how successful individuals creators job boards could be and the reason i'm interested in this is because hey that's like kind of like my career path is being a creator and i think about like the previous wave like tim ferriss and those guys they didn't have any of these different business models they didn't have rolling funds they didn't have ghost kitchens they didn't have job boards as like a way to capitalize on their audience they just sold books and then like that was kind of it and now creators have a whole different arsenal of ways to make money one of which is a job board so he did this with with pomp he did uh pallet does this with uh you know lenny the kind of like the product management guy so lenny's got a job board if you want to become a pm well you could just go to like linkedin or indeed but if you're a pm and you follow lenny and you love his content about being a better pm it kind of makes sense palette is the job board software that all these creators use bro do you think that's going to be a huge thing i've created job boards use a wordpress plugin yeah so here's the here's the difference uh this is like a classic um i think this is a classic mistake which is like webflow dude i could use wix right like shopify i can do this on squarespace it's like the there is a benefit to when something really focuses on a use case and a niche and attacks it from in a different way so what they did was um they built this job board thing to go to creators or communities so like for the hustle you guys could be the hustle could be do you guys have a job order now we we yeah we launched one as a test how did it do uh it didn't do well but i wouldn't say it's because the idea is bad it's just that we were when we were deciding between trends and something else that something else was a job board and we were like let's do this other thing so these individual creators guess how much they're making off their job board i would love to know i don't know give me a guess what do you think lenny's making off his job board 100 grand a year at most so i don't want to blow up these guys his own economics but let's just say i looked at 10 of these and i looked at okay how much money do each of these make people of their level of fame which is like they're not truly famous they're like niche famous yeah internet famous quarter million dollars and pop pomp i think is going to make about a million dollars off his job board this year he's going to be running off his job and and he doesn't have to create content every day he doesn't have to you know get on right so his newsletter he's got to write a [ __ ] newsletter every morning right like that that's his people pay him 9.99 and he's got to write the newsletter every morning that job board that's just for free after already building the audience so what's the um what's the business model for pallet uh so they basically take a percentage of whatever the creator's making so and so how does the creator make money creator makes money because the companies who want to access talent in that niche go and they pay the 500 or a thousand dollars to um to post their job and so they pay let's say a thousand dollars per per job posting they're gonna get candidates that are highly qualified uh the creator can sort of like do two things they can take some of the jobs and they can sort of like boost them and basically say if i was if i was you guys these are companies that i would go work for so you can endorse the jobs you can also endorse the candidates so you can take your audience and just instead of just saying hey my full audience is this you can say hey these 400 people are like kind of like the the the top the cream of the crop in terms of my audience these guys are like kind of like the superstar talent and so you actually have to pay more to access them um or when they match with this i'll when you post a job i will actually specially message those people um and that's like kind of like a premium offering so so they basically give you the software to do this the reason i think this is interesting for linkedin linkedin is one giant central uh like job board basically right so like that's the way linkedin makes money is i forgot we were even talking about linkedin um so so i think this is a distributed version of linkedin it's basically saying nobody nobody's going to build a 500 million person social network for professionals professionals again that's linkedin's advantage but what if instead of 500 million people on one network you had 500 you know you know 50 000 people on whatever 100 networks or whatever it is do the math and so you you you split it where um like one example they have is um there's a like a community of developers who all write let's say angular angular is a javascript like framework so they have a big discord of thousands of angular developers well they should have a job board for people who are trying to hire developers who write angular right who angular developers um that would be the business model for running that community for putting in all the hard work and running a great angular community the job board would be a great way and if i'm an employer i'd rather go to the angular community and write on their job board than just post on linkedin wow so this is this company they've like raised legit money who palette yeah they're not like a it's like i mean they raised four million dollars yeah it's like a startup startup um that's pretty wild um so you kind of turned my opinion on this who all anyone interesting invested in this besides you yeah a lot of the creators because a lot of the creators like holy [ __ ] this is great like i will invest in this and i'll be a user of it because this solves a problem of mine right if i've done all the hard work to build a free audience and build trust with them and build a kind of a niche i'm i'm an authority in a niche and that niche is like a job maybe it's design maybe it's product management maybe it's you know developers or back-end engineers machine learning experts whatever it once i've done that if you have a way for me to monetize that doesn't require me to get up there and either teach or write content every day i'm in right and the economics seemed to work and and then the more job boards the more niche job boards that get created through this network now they can just when a company wants to post a job you can say hey you only you know you came here to post on the angular community but we have these five other job boards that are all for developers would you like to cross post and they can help like give get more reach on the job and they can help those creators get more money without marketing themselves so these guys yeah you changed my opinion it's pretty dope and the reason why it's interesting is the way that you described it was far better than what i thought it was going to be is zip recruiter do you know zip recruiter i know that ads i don't what do they do that's different they it's oh that's the same thing it's one place and they go post on indeed and they post on all the job boards right yeah so zip recruiter um at the time and still could be the case they were the fastest growing company out of la and the largest series a company ever meaning their valuation was the highest ever for a series a um and i believe it was it's crazy how times have changed but like their series a they value them at like hundreds of millions of dollars now it's like way different um but um and what they do is you uh so they raise uh i'm looking at no i think they're are they not like public like they advertise on bill simmons podcast like yeah they're probably close to so their series a they raised at a 300 million valuation which unfortunately is considered small now probably but they um they're they're going to go public yeah they're public size and they they make hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and what you do is they make a really so they what was that term orwellian what's that orthogonal or orthogonal uh that's it's a good term i'm going to steal that one um so what they've done is they do a couple things and if you told me what they were trying to do i would actually say oh wow this is way too complicated i don't think this would work but basically they do a couple things the first thing is that they make it really easy to um post your job anywhere so you just click you upload the job description and it posts in every single place you don't have to go to each one and so that's why an employer posts there the second thing that they do is now once once they got all these people to start posting uh their jobs on ziprecruiter you can now go to ziprecruiter.com and it says look for a job and so they get um they get um recruits right there and then on the back end they've now created a way that you can manage your hiring process and the way that they make money i believe is by uh um i think it's um software so you you can you can you can pay a fee to get access to uh uh like the crm as well as the post for free or you could do one off although po you got to pay for it to be posted in all the places and it's a the this strategy works really well so i'm on board i think ziprecruiter is is great uh but it's one of those like i don't know if this idea is going to work i thought it was worth a bet so i invested right so i'm talking my book a little bit here but it's more like all startups are you know it's unlikely that they succeed i wouldn't say the probability is that they go defeat linkedin it's just that i thought oh wow that is smart actually you're not going to build the 500 million person social network that's just so hard you have to who's going to be able to do that instead if you just say well all these individual creators and communities are already building their own little network what if i created a decentralized job board the job board instead of being in one spot it actually lives in each one of their little communities and that makes sense to me because like our friend andrew um uh you know andrew chen you know my favorite uh person who blocks me on twitter you're you're a good buddy he's got a great growth blog and then you know a lot of a lot of growth marketers yeah growth if he had his own if he had his own growth job board he would you know with essentially zero work probably making i don't know easily 150 grand a year 250 grand a year um of companies that want to hire growth growth hackers and growth marketers like andrew and so that would be a better more targeted place to hire somebody from than going to this sort of general sea of job app you know job applications and um so i think that that that part is what made sense to me with this although i was like you when when i first heard this i didn't want to take the meeting i was like great like you know uh bloggers are gonna become like blogger job boards what the hell is that right like i remember reading once that i can't get this out of my head which is like they go sub stack where b players teach c players what a players do it looks like oh [ __ ] that's so good that's such a kill shot who said that i think it was hunter walk i think it was on twitter um and you know but it's such a good call out right like the it's in many ways it's true right the most successful people the the true icons you know they're not creating a ton of content typically and um sometimes they do when they retire sometimes it's part of the growth strategy but for the most part elon musk doesn't have a sub stack right he's not trying to teach you and sell you a course on how to be a good ceo because he just is a good ceo and makes all his money there so often it's it is a b player teaching a c player what the a players do and i think that's like a harsh but true critique um and you know i myself you know feel like that many times um and i think that's when i was like from that angle i was like oh will this job board thing work but once i looked into it i was like this actually makes a lot of sense can we speak this is kind of relevant can we wrap up with this thing you have here about you're never uh even when you're late you're early yeah this is a very typical you thing so let's end all the philosophy i asked i asked sean last week to we said let's come up with a 10-minute short episode this morning i get a message from him saying i just did it this morning and i that's all i said and i clicked play and it said the first line was like i just woke up this morning and lost five hundred thousand dollars i was like up hooked i'm in and that where we can't run this on sunday we have to run this right now and so what what happened and um i guess what's this you're not late type of thing you want me to talk about the the thing from this morning you're going to talk about this you're not late thing this late thing okay the late thing so i was um i was looking back and uh i was doing a little kind of retrospect i said so i graduated from college you did one today when you like lost all this no no this is like a month ago i was looking back at 2010 and i remember being in college and i you know i had an iphone so i knew apple was the [ __ ] i used google constantly i used chrome and i knew i knew google was the [ __ ] um i was a believer in tesla i think i owned tesla shares at like i don't know 20 20x cheaper than they are today um so i saw all these companies and at the time google seemed super established right google's been around for for google had been around in 2010 for so many years right like over a decade plus or whatever same with apple was even older right 20 years old um they seemed like mature companies they didn't seem like where all the upside was and i looked back and i just did a little analysis i said when i graduated from college how big was google what was the market cap if i just invested that day um and this isn't like when you say oh if you invested in bitcoin in 2010 you'd be worth a gajillion dollars well yeah um that's because bitcoin was worth like 10 cents back then you know and it was like nobody knew if bitcoin was gonna be a thing but with google it was clear it was gonna be a thing apple it was clear it was gonna be a thing facebook it was clear it was gonna be a thing like my whole college was obsessed with it was pretty obviously gonna be you know somewhat successful and so here's some numbers 2010 when i graduated google's revenue was 5 billion today its revenue is 55 billion dollars and you could do the same thing with amazon for facebook and if you had just bought those companies back then you would have made 10 extra money right so like if i had just taken my last year of college tuition um and i just said hey dad instead of putting that into into college let's just put into these four companies that like we use their products daily they are already successful they're not going to google's not going to tank it's not going to fail let's just invest in google you know we would have 10 extra money or whatever by now i don't know the exact numbers it's not what's important the lesson is even when it feels late like you're established if it is a mega trend mega trends have way more room to run than you expect some of the mega trends were the internet as a whole the internet was a mega trend mobile was a mega trend and apple's been running on that mega trend for a while um you know cloud cloud is a mega trend and you see aws aws is big and every year it just grows at the rate of the fastest growing startup but aws is already like you know 40 50 billion dollars in revenue and it'll just keep growing really fast um and so so i think that uh mega trends are not to be underestimated and i was listening to this peter teal thing peter thiel who is like you know investor uh was one of the first investors on facebook created paypal that sort of thing peter thiel said you know there are many money managers out there you know financial advisors investment bankers uh mutual funds and they'll all try to pitch you their strategy hedge funds they'll all tell you how they're going to beat the market how they're going to do well he goes as an investor often it is the simplest and stupidest strategy the most obvious strategy that is all you need to do he goes uh in 20 i think it was 2013 or 2012 uh jim cramer the mad money guy on cnbc who by the way i think is like pretty awesome i think i think he's like a pretty good guy and his picks are not so bad are they uh i think i don't know i don't i don't look too much into him i don't know if he's a good guy i've never met him but um i know that for his he's an entertainer right he's on tv not because he's the best stock picker he's on tv because he's plays really well in the living rooms of america right and uh so anyways he did something which is what entertainers do he made up a catchy phrase he called facebook amazon uh netflix and google fang he made that up yeah he invented fang in 2013. and peter till pointed out he goes if you had just put your money into fang which were obviously great companies there were technology companies that were growing um and you didn't even need to know how fast they were going but if you just said these are solid companies that you know seems like everybody in america is using their products um you would have made six times your money in the last uh eight years and he goes that would beat the performance of almost ever any money manager or headphone headphone hedge fund or investment banker that you're that you're thinking of working with he goes the problem is those strategies are too stupid even if even if a financial advisor thought that that was a good bet they could never charge you the you know one percent of all your assets that they charge as their fees to just tell you to invest in facebook amazon netflix and google and go go to sleep like don't don't touch it for 10 years but in reality that was the best advice and he goes um the same thing he goes i believe the same thing is true for bitcoin today and uh it's the the advice is almost so so simple that a money manager would be embarrassed to say that this is their strategy so they'll come up with a more complicated strategy that will actually underperform well i don't just buy bitcoin and chilling i agree with that sentiment i don't think it's just a money manager thing and i would say look at your actions and my actions are similar to yours but we are we do a lot of silly stuff um you're investing in risky startups when you're right now you're pontificating um that you think bitcoin is gonna 6x in eight years if you think that it's gonna six x in eight years put all your money in it then right um so i don't think to be fair i pretty much have at this point and i and i'm using you as an example i i'm incredibly guilty of this well and just i i mean you as a human being um but basically like that's what we do is we [ __ ] stuff up because we can't sit still what's like the famous quote of like all of humans problems exist because we can't just sit silently by ourselves a man can't sit alone in a room for 30 minutes yeah and um that's kind of the issue here and it's kind of sucks because i'm in the same boat i know that if i just played it like i i'm even more conservative than fang i'm like s p 500 i'm like so long as the hundred trailing hundred years repeats itself like if i don't think the trailing 100 years is gonna repeat itself and there's probably like huge problems with america right and so i'm like as long as that trailing hundred repeats itself like right like everything's gonna be great and days like day today happen and i'm like oh [ __ ] gotta do this gotta do that gotta do this right um yeah so so i guess like that i was a little bit long-winded in that i don't think i really nailed my point my point is when there's a real mega trend what feels like ah it's already played out nope there's a lot more to go and the hard part of course is figuring out what's the real what's a real mega trend what's not but in retrospect they were sort of obvious mobile was a mega trend video is a mega trend internet was a mega trend and i believe crypto is a mega trend um and so you know those are those are mega trends and you know i remember i texted my dad today i go hey today's a great day to buy bitcoin bitcoin's 30 off it's black friday and uh and because every day he badgers me like he's like oh you've been talking about bitcoin since it was at 500 and then it got to 2000 i thought it was too much then it got to four thousand it got to twenty thousand i thought no way this goes above twenty thousand and then you know recently it's been sitting at fifty sixty thousand and he's like now i can't if i buy in i'm buying it fifty sixty thousand i should have bought it so did he do it so i told him i said hey you've been bitching and moaning about this like here it is it's at 30 something thousand go buy now is the time to buy and i know what's gonna happen he's gonna think well now it's in the red now it's not hot you know now i'm a little bit afraid because the whole market's afraid and uh so now he'll either not do it or he'll like tiptoe in and then he'll regret it later like i only put in so much because that's just like classic psychology of an investor right of a bad investor i should say and um and so so i guess like the the thought process for me here is that if you think this is a mega trend even 50k is it's not too late because it still has so much more room to grow if this is true now of course it could be wrong could not be it could fall over it could fail for many reasons but i think that when you identify these things the one of the worst mistakes you can make is either selling too early because you don't write out the you don't ride out the winner and then the second i think mistake i think you can make is feeling like you're late when history tells us that these things play out over like a 20 30-year arc i agree with everything i'm i'm nervous that because i don't i'm not the most education i have on bitcoin is you telling me whatever you like whatever what you tell everyone else is like this is this is my education on it um because it just doesn't interest me other than sticking it to the man um right and i have doubts but not i mean i'm six figures in so not that many doubts but uh maybe i'll take your advice and do it well i would say like you know you never uh you know probably the the best advice i could give is never invest on somebody else's conviction because um when they're wrong it it it it really leaves a bad taste in your mouth because you didn't believe to begin with well i believe in the premise of like you know like the government doesn't control it no one controls it like it's kind of crazy that you know yeah i agree in the high-level premise i think what i'm saying is i think you want to take somebody's if you hear my conviction the answer is not go do it the answer is go learn for yourself and ask yourself how much conviction do i have in this and then invest proportionate to your conviction because then at the very least when you're right or wrong you're gonna you're gonna assign the credit or blame to yourself and you'll have a either a lesson learned if you were wrong or a lesson learned if you were right about how much you followed your conviction and if your conviction was based in something real and so uh anyways not financial advice that's not my point my point was sort of like i thought it was very interesting observation that sometimes it's the the simplest investment strategies where you where you set it and you hold it you leave it actually will outperform and one of the reasons people don't do them is it's almost so stupid it's embarrassing if that's your strategy especially if your job is to be an investment you know manager a financial manager or financial advisor then it's really embarrassing to just recommend such a brain dead approach uh but history will tell us that that often that is the best returns great well i think that's a great place to end i always like ending in those rants i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like my days off on a roll let's travel never looking back

to it please do me a favor click the subscribe button on itunes and the follow button on spotify last week we got a ton more spotify listens because they're doing something i think there's like a

__ ] that we can do so do that now in this episode we're going to talk about course businesses um of course business is something that a lot of people are interested in i think it's one of the easiest ways to make a million dollars a year uh but we're also going to talk about how companies are making 100 million a year doing it so go ahead give us a listen we're going to talk all about the course businesses it's going to start in just a second and make sure to click subscribe click follow and we'll talk to you soon we got a lot of cool stuff going on but how you doing i'm good i'm still recovering from your sick burn about my uh sweatshirt [Laughter] they'll see on video it's it's it's not that it's bad it's just that it would have been a lot better if you wore it as like a nine-year-old in 1994 i look like a skateboarder who got his birthday present and uh you know a 12 year old skateboarder who got his birthday present and then abrayu clapped back at sam and told him he looks like a knight who's wearing the like chain link stuff that goes under your armor you look like the extra from the disney movie brink okay i have not seen that but you look like a 90s disney movie extra dude i wish that would be an upgrade from my reality have you um do you read books i can't tell if this is another burn well that's a transition to a real question do i read books do you know how to read yeah i read books how many books do you read [Laughter] i'm not this is like real i don't know how much do you bench press i read like i'm reading like a book all the time like it doesn't have one book that's going at any given time probably read i don't know three four a year do you um when you're reading it do you feel like you absorb it yeah i intentionally read slow and i reread and i take notes so that's what i'm doing now instead of like you know how like do you know who ryan holiday is i know about him yeah i love ryan he's cool but he reads like five books a week and that's popular that people will say like for their new year's resolution i'm gonna read 50 books this year right and i'm like damn that's hard just to do but like do you learn anything and what i'm trying to do now is only read two or three books a year but i'm i'm like quizzing myself i'm trying to master it and it's been really hard so what i do is i get a bunch of books like i'll buy a book every three days probably if anything looks interesting i have an unlimited book budget for myself and i've had this for a long time where i just decided okay i'm not gonna be i'm not gonna have a budget i do the same thing by the way it's and so i just instantly buy it on my phone i use the kindle app on my phone to read i have a kindle i have physical books sometimes but i'm all the phone is always with me so i like that better i end up reading more there and um what i do is i will i'll read like five percent of 50 books in a year right like i will just pick up a book i'll start skimming through it and uh i just assume that most books are bad and so i i i'm very i do not complete 95 of the books that i read that i start and i think that's totally okay the book has to actually like be interesting or grab me or say something interesting for me to try to finish it but then once i do read a book that i like i will reread that book multiple times over the years like i'll reread the books same i i do the same thing i use it as a reference book and i reread it a two times um i want to ask you so today i want to talk to you about course businesses and i went down a rabbit hole and i called someone right before the podcast in order to get intel and get insights it looks like you have a ton of ideas but can we start with something really easy which is you got into an argument with someone on twitter that's what you have listed here and i am you you you alluded to it a week ago what happened i don't know what you're talking about okay so uh all right i'm gonna try to do this without getting without restarting the fight um i tweeted out that i said you know um i don't even know what i said exactly i basically said elon musk and jake paul have um yes i said i said elon musk you know sells cars and uh launches rockets and raises money and does all this stuff and you know tesla never runs a commercial jake paul is like does the same he's going to sell millions of dollars of pay-per-views for this boxing match that he is coming up uh without a commercial and i said the best marketers don't spend a dime right just kind of like a an observation it's not like obviously and also like a cute sound bite tweet yeah just a sound bitey thing obviously many marketers spend money and they're great at it and it's a smart thing i do i spend money when i advertise too it's great so that's not really the point the point was some people are able to hijack people's attention in the news and have done very well with it right so i tweet that out doesn't even seem like that controversial of a statement to me um move on with my life and then a few people start comment a bunch of people were like yeah true blah blah and then a couple people comment like um you know yeah but jake paul's an [ __ ] okay fair enough doesn't matter to me um and then one person who's a writer for the new york times basically says um i can't believe you i i can pull up the tweet i should pull up the tweet because this is gonna be stupid if i uh and while you're doing that the person you're talking about her name is taylor lorenz she works for the new york times a lot of people in the tech world and a lot of people in general uh really dislike her and i'm i i actually let's be objective here a lot of people really love her so we don't always want to go to the negative side but sure okay so i have my stuff in front of me and by the way i don't have her tweet because she now has blocked me but uh so that's the end of the story all right so i said elon is pumping dogecoin on saturday night live while the paul brothers are raking in tens of millions just by stealing floyd mayweather's hat while the camera is on the greatest marketers don't spend a dime uh by the way did you see the hat thing the gotcha hats so funny yeah so funny okay so uh if you haven't seen it jake paul's older brother logan is scheduled to fight floyd mayweather logan paul is a youtuber floyd mayweather probably the great greatest boxer ever it's not even going to be close it's not even a it's not even a like a real contest it's like 2001 odds yeah it's like celebrity death match you have two celebrities disagreeing to go punch each other but like one of them is actually a professional puncher yeah and um so anyways but they have to sell the fight so in the press conference you know they have to pretend like oh i'm talking trash like i'm gonna beat you and you're talking trash like you're gonna beat me anyways jake paul stole the show this wasn't trending very well because it's so one-sided not a lot of people wanted to go buy this because there's not much intrigue of what's going to happen the only people want to buy it are just people who want to see a bit of a circus and so jake paul goes up to floyd mayweather and they're talking [ __ ] and they're like um you know i could beat you up you could beat me up and then jake paul goes gotcha hat and then just took his hat and ran away like an absolute third grader on the playground funny as hell uh of course you know to ham it up floyd miller tries to go fight him because he took his hat and then there's like you know 70 people all holding their camera phones up recording the thing and it's just reading that show yeah so that that went viral that goes that gets on every you know blog and that goes viral on social media some people think it's stupid some people think it's whatever doesn't matter what your opinion is they got a bunch of attention from it so that's all i was pointing out um and in fact jake paul then tripled down on it which was he uh he did the gotcha hat thing it goes viral on social media while it's going viral he has this merch guy gotcha hat hats uh puts it up on his store sells out of gotcha hats gotcha hat hats and then he gets a tattoo on his leg that says gotcha hat and post that that goes viral that jake paul got a tattoo of the thing that just happened so he got a double pump a second pump of news pr out of it so i was just pointing out that these guys are good at marketing they're good at marketing themselves they're self-promoters by definition you really can't disagree that the paul brothers are not good self-promoters they self-promoted themselves yeah huge anyways a bunch of people say yes and then a couple people are like um you know these are pranksters they shouldn't be labeled as great marketers don't set them up as anything to be emulated um basically like don't say they're good because people what they were saying was like people follow you well they were basically saying well sean they're bad people and you're like yeah i don't care that's not the point they could be the worst person on earth i'm just saying i'm just showing that they get eyeballs yeah they're effective at marketing that's all i said yeah it's like saying like a like a cigarette company could be a great marketer who cares if you think cigarette is good or bad and so this writer for the new york times basically takes us as an opportunity to come in and promote her own article in the new york times that says i covered the story about the sexual assault allegations against him so you you know you really basically i don't know exactly she said because again she blocked me i can't go read it but it said something to the effect of um like it's messed up to um to promote them or say something like to be saying that they're good or whatever when they're actually jerks they're bad guys they're [ __ ] they're whatever this guy's been accused of sexual assault so i kind of i don't even remember what i said back but i kind of went back and forth and i was just saying what you just said i am not saying that they're good humans i'm not saying they're great citizens i didn't say they should be president i said they're good at marketing i don't really see how that's arguable and then you know they clap back again and said you know basically you're a jerk for saying that he's good and um and so a couple things happen first is dude i i like r kelly could be a great singer and also a horrible human being yes and so so one of them was like you know is there really anything to learn from these guys um blah blah blah and so anyways they're going back and forth i and i'm i'm getting agitated at this point and so the new york times writer she goes she said something that was like again just like trying to like virtue signal and i just replied i go she was she she said something like i don't think he i don't think he knows the point he's i don't think he he's making the point he thinks he's making talking like replying to me talking about me but as if i'm like not in the room anyways i thought that was like a weird way of saying it and so i just go you are the jake paul of journalism oh my gosh got blocked uh instantly um and you know a bunch of people were that got a big reaction out of people now i thought this was the perfect kill shot why because that's not an insult to me i'm so first of all it's true her brand of self-promoting herself as a journalist is confrontation she gets in confrontations with keith for boy with biology with neva with whoever right she just goes and picks fights on twitter with mark andreessen and so she she goes to the biggest names she creates controversy picks fights and then she also like then as soon as they sort of attack back then she turns that into a story which is big bad tech is bullying me um and so i was just pointing out that actually her form of self-promotion is the same as jake paul's he went to floyd mayweather agitated him picked got gotcha hat and used that con controversy in that confrontation to build his own brand so i was a correct in the way identifying her own playbook of self-promotion b it's not an insult to me again i have no problem with jake paul jake paul came on the podcast um you know i i think this guy's a good marketer i think that i i don't take such a black and white look at people and say that this person is good and this person is evil and this person is you know like i just don't think that the world is that black or white and so uh anyways i wasn't trying to answer her but she took it as an insult of course because that's why it was the perfect one-liner uh i was able to insult her without even insulting her and so um so anyways that was the confrontation and then uh yeah i got you know a bunch of dms from people and then you know people of my company were like hey can you not like pick fights with journalists and i was like okay i'm sorry i really wasn't trying to pick a fight with the journalist initially oh that's pretty funny um well that's a good story i still have no problem with her i actually think she's a really effective marketer of herself too like i know her name i don't know anyone any other tech journalist name i genuinely think she does a very good job at promoting herself by covering interesting and controversial topics like she was covering tick tock early on and then also her brand of sort of like taking it to the you know powerful people in tech i view it as an effective form of marketing i also think she's good at it so it's i really have no ill will but i did think it was a cool uh online i think that's a pretty good one liner i didn't i unfollowed like everyone on twitter i've been spending less time on it because it makes me angry but i wish i would have seen that because that's pretty well by the way by the way this was the best part all the white knights do you know what a white knight is yeah so for those who don't know white knight is like sort of a how would you describe it like someone who like they don't they don't necessarily care about the topic they're just trying to act like they're saving the day so uh the girl likes them yeah it's basically dudes online who come to the rescue of women to virtually signal how they are you know such they are the good noble supporters of of good and evil whatever um so anyways there's a bunch of white knights that were in the thread that were like yeah sean i can't believe you did this i can't believe you would give someone this platform first of all jake paul has a 50 times bigger platform than me uh second of all um yeah i that's my that is my platform i point out things that are interesting or you know i point out truths i'm not like trying to toe the politically correct line and then i go to this guy's twitter i go to his twitter the second retweet is conor mcgregor has sold this many millions of dollars of whiskey you know he's promoting it guess who also has a bunch of sexual assault allegations against them right now conor mcgregor so he was allowed to promote that conor mcgregor i called him out i go dude i like you we've we've been friendly before but what a hypocrite look at your own timeline dude you're saying this guy is great he goes honestly i just didn't i didn't know that about conor and so it's and then a bunch of people were eye-rolling like oh you didn't know good yeah okay cool like you're literally know that everyone knows that that guy like punched an older guy in the bar like this has been on the news yeah yeah you thought conor mcgregor was sort of you know goody two shoes yeah right like this guy's been in the news he's been in jail he's done all this stuff and so i just thought that that was the the classic hypocrisy of of people on twitter well i uh i didn't see it i'm happy i know the story i'm and i'm what i i love that you do that i think that is great and i think you should continue to do it hopefully you won't you won't not do that because you were asked not to but we'll see do you want to talk about the course business because i actually i didn't get into it but i i saw a company that i think is kind of silly for what they're trying to disguise themselves as but i actually think it's good for what it re it really is and i want to bring it up but i did a ton of research and i know that you're interested in courses as well yeah okay i'm fully teased i go for it what is it what's the company okay so today uh the for this little segment let's talk about the course business the education business whatever i broke it down into four different categories but there's this company called i don't know if it's called be on deck or on deck yeah it's called on deck the you the url is beyonddeck.com um it's actually really confusing what they advertise themselves as if you go to beyonddeck.com frankly i didn't know what it was i didn't understand it i did some research i think i understand it now um and the way that i see it is it's a course business so basically you pay i don't even know the price actually is it like 500 uh it's like hundreds of dollars i believe and you sign up for it's over a thousand dollars it's over a thousand dollars is it under two grand yeah i think it ranges between one and two grand something like that one or two maybe one in three one and three grand and you sign up to a cohort based class meaning there's a start and an end and they have got like 15 different classes probably at this point i got to stop you there's these aren't it's not a class why why are you saying it's a class yeah that's what it is um you can you can call it there's no teacher there's no uh okay so here's how i here here's here's how i would describe it right so so we you you know eric thornberg right he's i don't know oh you don't know him okay eric's good guy he's he was early on at product hunt he left and he's created a bunch of things since then one of which was on deck so the way he thinks about on deck and the way he talks about it is on deck is basically like a modern day business school so why do people go to business school people go to business school because they want to build a network they want to maybe learn about business and they're looking to kind of like pivot their career in a different direction right they were doing one job they want to go to the next job they don't know what it is they want to change industries change roles change whatever change careers so business school is this great pivot point to do that so what on deck did was they sort of made an unbundled and digital version of that um actually not even digital there's a lot of in-person components to it so what it is is you um let's say they have a bunch of different tracks but let's say you want to go into let's say you want to become an angel investor and you're not an angel investor today so on deck is your pivot to do that you apply to join you say great i'll pay the 1500 to go to the on deck angels program and yes there is some education they bring in speakers who are angel investors they'll talk about angel investing that sort of thing but it's basically a x-week program for you to you know go from where you are now to that track that you want to be on and it can be with angel investors it's a little bit more like a course which you're talking about which is you're going to learn about a thing and then by the end of it you can do it but they it started with just people who were on deck to build their next company i was like all right you don't know what you're going to do next why don't you join a group of other people who are also thinking about their next opportunities maybe they have a great idea you could join their team maybe you could find a co-founder and and do this here and it was just people who were looking to make a change and um and you would pay to basically enhance to join this to get a good network so the network is all kind of like other kind of like just like if you go to harvard you're getting other people who have a certain caliber of person who's going to go on to do a certain caliber of things and you pay to go be a part of like an eight-week program or whatever to go do that yeah that sounds like a class to me an eight-week program where you're learning and talking it's just a lot less about the learning content side and it's a lot more about the network that you want to build then in that case i would say the likelihood that they're going to be quite huge i think is actually lower it would actually be better if they were a course business because the problem with that is they're either going to raise prices to be tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars a year or they're gonna have to decrease the standards of who they let in and keep the price low and thus ruin their network so let's talk about some of the programs that they have right so they have on deck founders that's i want to go start a company they have on deck first 50 which is i want to become i'm a talented operator i want to go join a early stage company in the first 50 employees that's going to that's going to be the next airbnb the next whatever right uh there's on-deck investors where you learn about angel investing there's on-deck podcasters where it's like if you want to start and kind of grow a podcast join a batch of other people who want to join to start a podcast listen to speakers who are existing successful podcasters and by the end of it you'll have like built up some momentum of now going down this new path that you weren't on before so let's just say who cares about on deck because it got me thinking about the course business i think it's a course business you say it's not it doesn't really matter what it is because that is what got me interested in the course business and the problem with the course business is when we say the course business oftentimes people will categorize anything that's even remotely related to course into the same category and that's actually false that's not that's not how it should be um and so what i want to talk about is the four categories and let's talk about why each one is interesting and so i'll just briefly list what those are so the first one is basically one person or a smallish company making a handful of courses that's like our friend jack butcher right that's like ramit satya our good friend or my good friend ramit sethi this and we're gonna i'll go back and we'll actually talk about what makes that what it is the second are platforms so things like udemy um things like teachable a lot of people say this is the course business that's not a course business that's a tech company that uh makes technology so people can create and sell courses i'm not even gonna talk about that because that's a totally different category even though people do sometimes refer to it like uh this category or with courses the third one is the master classes of the world these are another example is this company called the great courses these are businesses that create hundreds eventually of different courses and they go and sell to consumers for 100 bucks to 200 300 a year and the fourth one is b2b companies that sell education to companies and so a company like that is pluralsight which sold for three billion dollars and does something like 500 million dollars in revenue there's a there's a few other there's coursera there's um there's actually a handful of them that i didn't know about but in researching there's a handful that do 300 to 600 million dollars a year in sales multi-billion dollar business now i want to go through each one and explain what makes them tick or at least what i think make them tick and and in order to do this i went and talked to my friend ryan dice ryan dice runs this thing called digitalmarketer.com and he he's been in the game for 20 plus years and we kind of talked through this so the first category is these like single person creators i think you're like that um i'm not like that at the moment i could probably easily become that and um i i enjoy that and i actually think that the path to making a million dollars a year this way is incredibly straightforward and it's a very high likelihood in term all all relative to starting a business but it's like a really high likelihood of making like a million bucks a year it's very high likelihood that you can make 200 000 a year um and so these are companies like uh i will teach you to be rich uh doc is that what it's called i'll teach you to be rich.com it's uh what you've done what what was your newsletter called the all access pass that wasn't quite uh a course like it's what i announced i don't know if you saw this i tweeted out that i was doing a course yes yes and i said hey i'm gonna do a course uh on power writing basically like writing for the real world and i just tweeted out like would you be interested here's what this has helped this skill has helped me it's helped me get jobs it's helped me you know get investment it's helped me grow my companies help me make money so writing in the real world emails tweets blogs ads landing pages that type of writing you know going from good to great is a big difference would you want to learn this i said it would cost 400 bucks for the first batch of people whoever was like kind of the guinea pigs let me know if you'd want to do this and um i got i think i don't know 1200 replies of people filling out the survey saying they want to do this and so yeah just that alone is kind of like to your point here where if you're a creator with an audience with credibility if you've done something if you're actually good at a skill yeah you can get to a million dollars a year of profit uh not just revenue doing it as an individual course creator yes and the path is quite straightforward the tactics are are simple but uh it's basically build an audience that's all has the most part that mostly has yeah but even that there's a process to that i mean it does it's not it's not easy but it's simple but you build up an audience where people rally around one type of thing and then you eventually create something that costs 100 all the way up to thousands of dollars and you sell it um my good friend one of my best friends neville medora has done this with copywriting he probably i don't know what he makes but i if he said a million dollars a year i would think that sounds about right um there's jack butcher like we said my wife sarah is actually launching one shawn has one i've launched one at the hustle before but it's not live now but it was and it's pretty interesting it's it's the easiest path probably to make a million bucks a year i actually think and the way that you scale it's really hard though now here's the downside it's pretty hard i think to get past 10 million dollars a year in revenue on that not that like that should be the goal necessarily but like it definitely caps out relatively low um but you could if you as long as you don't base this on your personality it's a pretty good business that you could sell to like private equity or something like that for a bunch of money and after you've created the course you then create a consulting or coaching service that costs 10 000 plus a year and you could potentially have like a pretty good 10 million to 20 million your company i like that i'll give you an example my uncle does this he's in real estate he himself has like i don't know a 200 something million dollar real estate portfolio so he created a basically how to get into multi how to do multi-family uh apartment investing and he creates a course the course i think is like five grand um he sells a bunch of those and then out of that some people pay him 25 grand for like the more one-on-one in-depth coaching because they're like going at it and for them it's not hard to justify five or even twenty five thousand dollars because the economics of even a single apartment building um that they're buying are such that that's that's future what cost my uncle oh which uncle uh my uncle i mean you don't know you want you wanna you wanna pimp him out though i'm trying to oh i don't even know what his course is called he's my uncle vinny we should have him on he's got a kind of incredible story and his personality is amazing he's the most joyful person i've ever known almost to the point where people think he's like are you high or something and he but he's just like that 247 he's high on life 24 7. it's kind of amazing so uncle vinnie's a great example there there's a good one example of this now the second one that i mentioned is like these master class businesses these companies there's a pretty clear path to get to like a hundred million dollars a year in sales and what you do is you create something that is in the three 200 300 range for an annual subscription and you scale fast by buying a lot of ads um but before you do that you have to create a pretty big library of course content which can take many years i know quite a bit about masterclass do you want me to give you kind of like some of the interesting bits so master class they um started by sky went to harvard business school i believe um and then he you know one of the core insights was he wanted to create what he said was the library of alexandria for um alexandria or alexandra basically whatever the library was of like kind of like all the best of human knowledge at that time he basically was like i want to create that of today's time and so he they spend upwards of half a million dollars per masterclass just on the production value alone even their first one was over 500 thousand dollars and so the production value is like kind of insane it's like a hollywood shoot that they do personally i don't even know if that's necessary i think that's that's totally overkill but that's their stick the bigger part was that they got the biggest brand name so they go if you want to learn business well here's howard schultz from the ceo of starbucks you want to learn basketball steph curry's master class you want to learn comedy you're steve martin you want to learn i don't know writing here's aaron sorkin and so they took the the a plus plus talent which is a key differentiator right because most of these online courses are like you said it's me it's ramit safety it's like these like niche you know i'll just make fun of myself here right we're nobodies in the in the world compared to compared to what masterclass went and did and masterclass was like great i can take you know chef gordon ramsay's cooking course i can create a hype 30 second trailer and i can blast that on facebook ads and basically gordon ramsay has enough brand pull that i can profitably acquire customers and so they do this with a bunch of creators a bunch of different um course creators serena williams whoever else they cut a rev share deal with them so they give them an upfront kind of like minimum guarantee and then they have like a rev share on every course sold you know you get x and then they turned it into like a class past style subscription where now you pay the 15 bucks a month you get access to all of master class and i actually talked to the founder the ceo and i was like he's a great guy and i was like you know do people i took one and you know but like do people does does a person really want to go learn cooking from gordon ramsay and then basketball from this person then tennis from serena williams like it seems like do i need the all-you-can-eat buffet and like do i come back is the retention high and he just showed me the numbers he was like look we're making x hundreds of millions of dollars a year it's growing at this pace and look at the churn the churn's not so bad i said how do you keep the churn so low like for an education product like this he goes when people take a master class it's they keep their subscription even if they're not coming back and taking a course every month why because it's aspirational they they have a dream of like learning photography they want that hobby to exist they buy the master class and if they have one experience where they feel like their hero or their idol kind of shared like a real nugget of wisdom with them um that's enough to keep them hooked so i thought that was pretty interesting and that's the thing that we should discuss that's the downside of this business as well as every other category that i'm mentioning is and this is this freaks people out i wouldn't even say it's retention but it's completion so our good friend nick hoover launched the course and he goes dude 200 people bought this do you know how many people finished and did the whole thing he was i i the number is if it's not this exact number it's close he's like three right or something yeah it was like he was like nothing and i was like yeah man that's really normal um he was being he was like he was legit he was like dude did i make a shitty course i was like no this is the this is the standard percentage completion if you go to udemy i remember with udemy i think they had said at one point in time um six percent of people complete the course six percent right 100 students come in imagine on the last day of the semester six people are left in the class and so you know for nikes is pretty much in line with like this single digit completion rates that was a big problem with education and that sucks and actually i would say two things one um for people getting this business just know that mo it's so weird that you're gonna make all this money and you're crushing it most people don't even use the damn thing and by the way they're not pissed it's not that they used it because they didn't like the product often it's just life happened they got busy they didn't follow through they if they're upset at anyone they're upset at themselves for not actually taking the full action on the course they're not upset with the course yeah and just counter intuitive the second thing here is like is that even important is this even a problem worth solving and the answer i actually think unfortunately is no this is uh not a problem we're solving people aren't going to take it that is just how people are and we should move on and just make money off of it because just the fact that they buy that's interesting and that kind of helps them in a weird way just like you with books just like you at books it's like me with books yes that's true but i would disagree in that i do think it's the fight worth fighting for because if people aren't actually taking the course ultimately they didn't get the real value of the product which means they're not going to come back they're not going to tell friends to do it which means your business is gonna suffer so can it be done can you get above six percent ten percent can you can you get thirty forty fifty percent dude even that sounds [ __ ] crazy to me i've asked um people who charge five thousand dollars per course they said uh under 30 is still what they get as a completion rate it's insane because that's such a big financial commitment for people um individually not out of their company's pocket out of their own pocket just to spend that money and not complete it is insane to me but that's what happens now i will say though but when we had cohort classes like a live cohort class it was like 75 completion exactly that's exactly what i was about to say lambda school switched to live cohort based and with a um a clear like sort of uh high bar for entry so lambda school most courses right when nick hoover ramit and myself when you sell the course you want pretty much as many people as you can to take the course that's how you make your money right you're like a college you want to admit as many people as you can um unless you're the top college where your brand is really about not accepting everybody and so similarly with lambda school because lambda school doesn't get paid until you get a job their incentive was not to let any joe schmoe in their incentive was dude we only want a student if they're if we think they're actually going to finish this course if they're serious about it and so because of the filter on the front end plus the format being live and in a peer group they had like 75 plus completion rates and then i invested in this company maven for the same reason because they were saying hey we're going to make it easy for you to teach a cohort based course that was appealing to me because i was like so far cohort based courses is the only thing i've seen where people actually finish the course so we'll see so but that is something when we're going through this process we or this discussion we have to acknowledge that like most people don't buy your stuff yeah and if you're doing really well like what did you say 70 yeah do it so it's like kind of crazy that that's a pretty nutty nutty thing now to wrap up the master class i don't i have to call this like mass consumerism course category i don't know like lynda.com would also be in this at the time now linda's more b2b but when linda started it was a place to go learn anything right um and and so lynda.com masterclass there's a bunch of master class 4x so it's like there's a master class but instead of steph curry and gordon ramsay it's famous youtubers and they're called monthly i think monthly.com they're trying to do the same thing as masterclass but their stars are social media stars and i think they were doing actually pretty well there's another one that's masterclass for athletes it's like okay we're just going to take the vertical of of sports and it was you know started by exactly that sounds neat um [ __ ] i just talked to him the other day this would be a perfect shout out for him i apologize that i don't have it off top of my hand but uh but basically he he's a he's a trainer he's a trainer for kyrie irving he's a trainer for a bunch of nba stars and so he's able to carmelo anthony so he was able to say hey mello create a create your course hey kyrie create your course et cetera and um and so he's able to access top flight stars in basketball because he himself is a basketball trainer and create a master that's just of that group just for that audience which i thought was actually a pretty interesting model eight was his name adam robin i'll find the name let me ask ben real quick but yeah go on i'll get the name so anyway um in order to make that style of business work what you have to do is create a mostly evergreen course content and the name of the game is get like basically as many as possible that meet some type of quality bar um right and you just go big and try to create hundreds of them or thousands of them how do can you what the great courses is one example i think they do like 150 million dollars a year in revenue i don't know what master class is but i bet you they're at 200 to 300-ish yep um all right and then the fourth or the third cat so i had three categories i had like the small creator i had tech stuff but we're gonna get rid of the tech thing like udemy solo solo teacher platform like you to me and coursera and then you had high-end um you know library of of courses like masterclass what else now here's the fourth one and most interesting one which is b2b education corporate training type of stuff easily the biggest one hands down now an example of this is pluralsight have you heard of pluralsight i've heard of it but i could i've heard the name before but i couldn't have told you what it did until this beautiful lovely name it's geared specifically towards engineers and it just teaches like the latest and greatest uh um tech stuff that you you give to your engineers and and they go through this and uh pluralsight is one of them there's actually a bunch of more a bunch more and they there's many of them that do 300 400 500 million dollars a year in revenue and you but this is where it gets kind of shitty these businesses are based on one thing salesmanship so you just hire a fat sales team and you go out to these companies and you sell and i went and asked the people at hubspot i go why do you guys buy this stuff and they actually told me all about it and they're like well basically we're ranked really high in glassdoor and we recruit a ton of people and one perk that we have is that we give you five thousand dollars a year uh for education now we could have bought pluralsight but and that would have actually solved the same thing which is we want to be the best place to work we offer loads of perks like we'll teach you x y and z um another example of why these courses are important is something like cisco or microsoft have tests and exams that they want you to pass certifications that they want you to pass in order to either get a promotion or just you just put it on your resume that you have this interesting thing pluralsight teaches you uh how to succeed at those uh at those um um what am i saying at those uh certifications and they charge something like 600 a year per head and you just got to hire a sales team with the you give each salesperson like a 300 000 500 000 quota and you go here's the yellow pages start dialing and and that's why the pluralsight is based in utah because the mormons are like some amazing sales people because they've been they had to spend two years selling a religion of people so they're really good at it um but this business is probably the biggest but i oddly it's really not so much about the um it's not about education it's not about education it's about salesmanship and the way that you win this um is you you you go down a very narrow knit niche you hire subject matter experts so people who know their stuff you pay them a flat fee sometimes royalty but you prefer to do a flat fee because your gross margins will be really really uh a lot bigger and then you go very niche you go very role specific and then you go and you sell into the hr and then learning or learning and development budgets at large companies which sucks because uh those are typically the budgets that are slashed first but they're there and they have to get spent and so pretty much it's a game about getting inside with these people and selling to them kind of lame but there's money to be made yeah i wonder if somebody could do so so that's the way that most corporate software was sold too until slack and some others started this like bottoms up sales process inside companies where they basically how it sold though uh it isn't is it but there's so bottoms up sass became its own category where the model was you make your software useful to even if the whole company doesn't adopt it you let an individual person kind of the front lines or the middle ranks of a company start using it they use it with their team they're kind of like their sub team other sub teams start using it and then you go to the cio you have a meeting with them and you say hey by the way you know a bunch of your com a bunch of your employees are using this thing you need to buy the like the enterprise version so that you have like security stuff like secured you have oversight over what's going on and that anybody in your company can get access to this right now it's everybody's putting down their own card and trying to make this happen and so that became a pretty popular model yammer was one of the first to do it uh then slack and others um i wonder if this would be the only way i would want to do it if i was an entrepreneur going to space because i wouldn't really want to do the enterprise sales path where it's not really about the content it's just about the sales you know how good you are at sales as a company um because if you go bottoms up you're really going off of making stuff that the individual employees actually want to learn from and then secondly you're only as good as as them sort of retaining or actually wanting to use this so i think that's a healthy thing in the end although it is harder actually than the other path so i wonder if there's a way to do that the hard part here is just like there's six percent completion rate for hobbyists trying to learn i think similarly you know um for example i know that when when the learning and development team sends out an email at twitch i asked my team i said hey do you guys do any of these courses that there's a bunch of free stuff available here they pay for it you can just go take it like it could help you and they're like yeah that's a good idea but like i just don't have the time like everybody feels overworked so the amount of time an employee is going to carve out to just do optional education is so low that i just think that most of the things that live in the uh what's it called the learning manager whatever like the lms learning management system inside companies is uh untouched right it's just twinkies sitting on a shelf so that's exactly another that's another thing so not only is it about salesmanship but basically these courses the truth is it's not actually about teaching your workers something good it's about offering it and if they use it fine but the fact that you offer it it makes you look better and you could hire more people um as i don't own my company anymore but when i did i would never have bought the [ __ ] i've been like look if you want to take something we'll buy you any book you want i'm not but we're not paying for these stupid courses because no one's going to use them but that's not how a big company thinks because they want need to put it on their perks and benefits and here we are but that is my my very high level summary of this course business i was very curious as to how they work um if i was well i am i'm not going to launch any of the same time soon but the first one the creator one that's a that's a no-brainer it's a no-brainer once you have an audience right that's the if you don't have an audience it's not really going to work then then you're more in one of the other buckets but i think you correctly identified if you have an audience it's a no-brainer business model for people with audiences but it also has a cap and it takes up time so you gotta like you know choose accordingly all right let's talk about some other ideas um i have one that i saw today that i think is pretty interesting so it's called the irish pub company did you see this tweet no so we got tagged in this which is by the way that's the best signal that we're doing something right is now people just tag us in [ __ ] that they know is the type of stuff we want to talk about like we've built the brand of like when you hear about a cool niche business that's crushing it that's like so simple and you you would have otherwise just never heard of this it's like this is perfect for my first million so somebody tagged us oh this is awesome our friend um chris uh chris j becky is his like handle i don't know if it's becky or bach i don't know how you say it i think it's bach um he tweeted this out so so shout out to chris he was on the podcast a while back he's a super entertaining guy on twitter you should follow him so one of the things he said is he said the irish pub company is one of my favorite companies they charge one to four million dollars for a irish bar in a box which basically means it's an irish bar as a service so here's how it works um they give you you know like they have like six styles to choose from of which style of irish bar and they give you like the guinness signs the the right bar tap handles you know that kind of like all the decor the seats the the the stuff like that and they they ship it all to you and they install it for you and like bang now you have an irish pub and i think this is such an amazing business so they've done over 2 2000 kits and it's about one to four million dollars per kit according to him so i haven't this this happened like two minutes before the pods i didn't research too much more but that's over 30 years that's 2 billion over 30 years that this company has generated just selling the irish bar in a box and um and what they say if you go to their website is like you know hey uh like the here's the stats right like the uh irish pubs produce you know x more revenue than a traditional bar and has this much more foot traffic and basically it's saying hey if you if you throw this kit onto a generic bar your bar is more successful it'll pay itself back uh what do you think of this business so the owner's name is mel mcnally which is like the perfect perfect got him um he's the founder of irish pub company he's the creator of the guinness irish pub concept so he launched this in partnership with guinness brewery brewing which is basically i'm just reading the about page sounds to me like dennis was like hey we need more irish pubs to exist in this world okay so we can sell more ir irish beer and get us beer can someone uh come and help us figure this out and that's what he partnered with uh or that's how we started this awesome awesome awesome this is so cool i love this um it's crazy they're making i mean i think just looking at the numbers if these numbers on their website are accurate i think they're doing like 50 million dollars plus a year um doing this just like the consulting the brand identity then the like insta the shipping and the installation and then the service after that um dude it's pretty pretty awesome how'd they do it inside airports they do it in you know just different cities hotels different stuff like that how did your buddy find this i have no idea he just tweeted it out um so it's great i don't know i think this is such a cool concept and then you can think about like okay how many more concepts are there like this right so like i i can think of if you take any sort of like sub genre the question is is there a market for that so i'll give you let's just brainstorm for a second right well there's one one great example that you brought up a long time or a year ago that i think is probably killing it and that was bathroom in a box yes made renovations yes all they do you select one of five different bathrooms and they come and make it you can obviously do this for every single room in the home but then we talked about the guys who came and set up our video conferencing setup that you know this good looking setup that we have right now with the lighting the audio the dslr camera have the whole tech is set up the wires are you know taped to my table so i don't have a wire mess i told the guys i said hey you need to turn this into home home video conferencing home studio in a box right you could you could do just like the bathroom guys did you could do this in every city in america right now especially with remote with podcasters and twitch streamers and youtubers a lot of people want a cool video set up and if you just have four to choose from on your menu now you have simple operations you have scale as you buy parts in bulk that sort of thing so i think that's another version of this um but just in the bar concept i think that there's a few more so i think that any brand with licensed ips so like okay you can't like you could you do but could you do this for basically disney could you do a disney diner right um so you take ip that people love and you create a bar restaurant out of it right so like sort of rainforest cafe style and you just sell that as a in a box concept for any um common thing coffee shops diners pubs aren't you confusing this whatever this in a box concept is compared to franchises so it's not france so this the idea would be you would partner with um let's say i don't know let's call it the simpsons you partner with the simpsons franchise and you say hey look for every one of these wouldn't it be great if you could have you know i forgot what the bar is called in the simpsons but like whatever that you know wherever moe works or whatever yeah or do paddy's pub yeah exactly you go to always sunday and you can basically have paddy's pub in a box and every city should have a paddy's pub and whatever and um so you go and you say every one of these we sell you guys get ten percent you gotta do nothing more than let us use the name paddy's pub and you know the the same items we're going to source and now you go to bars and you say hey look you as a generic bar you're only pull you have no like differentiation of why tourists should come here why the locals should choose you can you upgrade and so i think that there's a bunch of different concepts that would work with this so i think one is gaming gamers have like a deep passion and and so there's been i i lived in denver and there were some bars like this where it was like the bar had like some old school retro arcade machines all the drinks and menus looked you know like video game like you know old nintendo stuff and then they had like you know life-size jenga or whatever right but it was a place to go hang out you could play skee-ball you could do whatever and they just got way more foot traffic than a normal bar why because this one you would go to and you would have instagram worthy experiences right you would post in your story that you're drinking you know the mario drink while playing whatever duck hunt or skee ball or whatever it is and so i think gaming is one niche that's like an irish pub that you could show that hey if you if you kit your bar out with this you're gonna get more foot traffic and more sales i would need to think about which which of these could work but whatever this in a box thing it's kind of interesting i had a friend that did book in a box and they would write a book for you i think it was making eight figures in revenue but it sounded like a real pain in the ass because it was it was far too customizable to be in a box whereas a pub thing probably isn't that's way easier that's like saying like you got runny water you got uh you know this many dimensions well this is basically just a set like it's one interior decoration like theme that you just slap on and boom you got an irish pub now you don't you had a pub now you got an irish pub and so i just wonder you know a could you just compete with them or b are there other themes that are even if they're not as popular as an irish pub like what's the second most popular kind of like is it german is it you know an asian style pub is it a russian drinking bar is that i don't know i don't know i think like is it a mexican tequila bar is it you know what what is it that that is it an italian wine bar i don't know i don't know you're asking a non-drinker i'm i'm out of the loop on this one i do have a different idea that i think is kind of interesting to chat about so uh clear ice have you ever heard of clear ice hmm what is it this to me feels like if you're um i'll find you the url go to clearice.life so cleareyes.life so this is not something i would do but i've learned that these things where i just shake my head i'm like who the [ __ ] wants to do this i learned like the hard way that like three years later it's like yeah this is like this is like a hobby that a lot of people have that's like growing like crazy so here's the other examples of this you know like sodastream i think you probably do sodastream right dude i have a video on tic toc one of the only videos i ever posted it got like 200 000 views because i attached a like a scuba tank size co2 thing i rigged it to my soda stream so it could last like three years versus having to constantly replace the things yeah i love sodastream so the first time i heard this i was like oh you like make your own sparkling water at home like what's the [ __ ] point of that like sodastream is like a 5 billion a year company or something i know that's my point is that when i heard i was like who would wanna why is this a hobby who wants to do this at home why is this a diy category but it was it was a huge category and like you know got bigger and bigger craft beer same thing i remember like a decade ago these guys were like brewing their own beers and i was like why there's so many beers i don't just go buy some and then like over time more and more home brewers and craft beer dude have you ever met a white guy before like that's like like there's two things that you you there's a two jokes about uh white people they always have bottle openers on them and they love baking their own beer at home yeah basically actually this category is just [ __ ] i observe white people do and i'm confused about uh so another one like there's this there's a bunch of these like with pour over coffees and like these like really extreme coffee habits that people have anyways there's a whole bunch of these these little niche hobbies of diy things that i don't understand but they definitely are big and then they create a whole ecosystem of businesses around them so clear ice is the latest one i saw that i was like this basically what is clear ice clear ice is basically like i'm idea i might not even fully understand this it's that's how white this is okay so you you translate this for me what i understand is it's like a it's like an amazing piece of ice so not just the [ __ ] you get out of your fridge or your little tray or the stuff you buy in a bag but it's like this is high quality it's like super clear like there's no um you know impairments or like kind of stuff in it so it doesn't flavor your if you're drinking whiskey it won't like affect the flavor of your whiskey it's also one big cube so there's less surface area so it dilutes uh less it doesn't dilute your drink less well you knew that right i didn't think about this stuff i don't care i just put the ice in i drink my drink when it gets diluted i drink it it's kind of gross i haven't it's like they sell it like yeah yeah they like sell these like cubes or balls and they yeah it involves surface area and melting and diluting your [ __ ] slower right and so so anyways this hobby this is like some [ __ ] that you would find in the hustle trends thing this is my own little contribution to trends uh you know if steph smith if you're listening put this in the news like go research this my spidey sense is tingling that this is one of those little niche hobbies that you could sell products information courses whatever and there's a lot of people that want to make their own homemade ice again i can barely understand why but it's a thing that people are doing and i bet you that there's a uh a movement to be had or a sort of a wave to surf if you want to build a business around this super niche but a hobbyist business dude no i don't i'm not on board with this i think this is stupid i think why first of all is this even that big it's clear i saw it as part of like a growing trend i don't know if it was a subreddit or where i saw it but i saw it in a way that was like oh this is one of those that's like popular and i don't understand why like it's like asmr it's like what is that uh asmr is awesome so don't you better be careful that's how me at the beginning when i'm like this is weird people do this and then like yeah a lot of people want this and do this yeah look i i'm looking around on google i get it to me this sounds like a pretty tiny thing but like tiny enough that you could make like a pretty good living doing it though like i knew yeah all you want to do is you want to catch these early right like you wanted to you want to catch it when it's somewhat tiny but like very passionate because the bet you're making is that that passion the tiny the passion will stay and the tiny will not right that's pretty consistent uh is that when you have the passion there passion stays and tiny go becomes medium-sized becomes large over time yeah i guess it could work i mean i'm looking i'm trying to like look it up i mean there was this other one there was a home brewery company that i that i i for a long time i didn't know that like people basically beer nerds like track all the beers that they've ever tried and i interviewed a guy to work at the hustle and he worked at one of these companies and it was like a tens of millions maybe even close to hundreds of millions of dollar revenue business and all it was was an app where you could track all the beers that you uh drink um so put that in that category of things i have no idea exists and also kind of they don't excite me [Laughter] all right let's do let's do one more real quick um okay here's one that i'm just curious i don't have ideas around this just yet but let's let's do a off-the-cuff brainstorm so there's this article that came out that was about uh i'll share it with you here it's about the amount of space that is now available in san francisco because of like work from home so there is some absurd amount of vacant space so there's like companies that are taking 10 or even 100 million dollar write-offs on their real estate just to like get out of it and move on and so they're just they're just writing it down so like here's some of the the numbers um i mean so there's 200 million dollars of real estate impairments in the past year since covid it's almost a billion if you add in the least related write-downs from large companies like salesforce dropbox uber paypal zendesk just getting rid of their their uh real estate and so um dropbox itself has 400 million dollars of impaired real estate right now and so they think that by you know in this quarter or the first quarter of sorry the last quarter of 2021 the amount of vacant and subleasable space was 10 million square feet in 2021. in 2019 that was three million right so it's tripled the amount of available um subleasable squares uh square footage and the companies are basically saying hey this is it costs us 90 we'll take 20 for it so you're able to get real estate for you know one fourth of the of the traditional cost now we're talking this is a good idea yes this is an interesting real estate so what comes to mind what what do you think of when you hear about kind of this this opening that's in the market okay for the sake of discussion let's just assume that they like san francisco has a bunch of wacky laws like um right um i mean like you all can't do with things yeah and they also have like some really crazy tendent uh um what's it called rent controlled stuff so let's just assume that like we're gonna research these laws later and and that isn't that big let's assume we're never going to research these laws that's really interesting um but so what could you do with this arbitrage i mean the obvious answer is like wework can make a killing right now if they believe in their model can they can they just go ahead and like do the thing where they uh lease a lot of it up front and hopefully they can fill it but what else could you do with this i don't know man that's a hard question what would you do i don't know i think you have to see what um what i think you want to think about this way where is demand growing for space that being central in a city would now make a very big difference cloud solutions cloud kitchens cloud grocery and convenience uh like cloud cloud corner stores basically like um fridge no more or something like that i think those are kind of interesting because go puff because you have a whole bunch of people in the city and now when they push the button they get their thing in under 10 minutes because it was they took a floor in the bottom of the salesforce tower you know the second floor is now all you know robo convenience stores that will just quickly deliver to you so i think you have to find something like that maybe it is wework style you know kind of um co-working spaces but there's got to be something else that you would do with this primo real estate maybe there's something in education that you know you create a distributed campus or something like that um across a whole bunch of different cities and so you know you take a business school i do you know take harvard business school online which they have and you basically say great you can attend harvard business school online in san francisco downtown in la downtown in all these places because that's where that type of clientele wants and now you get a once in a lifetime opportunity to lock up that real estate at a fourth of the cost i don't know those are some just random ideas off that is a i think that's quite an interesting idea of that that's actually a good idea because that would yeah some you know like the equivalent of a study abroad but you're just going to do it in san francisco which prohibit was prohibitedly expensive for the longest time that is actually kind of an interesting idea um so what do you know what the price per square foot is right now in this they were 25 they were saying 20 a square foot um which is like that's an annual number right so it would have been 90 a square foot annually and now 20 is kind of what's quoted in this uh cnbc article do you know how that compares to like an austin like a more like a sea level city i don't know i think that is like what i think that would be like what a mid-level city would have been um without the pandemic that's my guess is something like that i think san francisco was four or four to five times more expensive per square foot um than than you know a b-level city you know i think that i've been living in austin now for just a handful of months i miss san francisco dearly i do think that if you're starting a company now um and you have like a good sized workforce it would be interesting to try to kind of sign a lease now that you can book out for five or ten years i do like it's gonna roar back i think eventually um i mean i think that's the opportunity here's another one let's say you're it was random let's say you're a venture fund or late stage venture fund what if you took the real estate and then basically any of your companies can just use this and pay you the you know pay you market rent or slightly above maybe slightly below so all your portfolio companies now have their real estate problem uh solved and you know you could place them because of that dude people were [ __ ] on wework myself included i think now it's like this this makes sense in a lot of these cities these we the weworks of the world and not only that i think that they're just going to come back like crazy because every employee says the exact same thing well i would love to work from home for a few days a week yeah exactly it's like well dog i can't pay rep few days a week uh if i have my own lease right i'd love to die a few days a week yeah so i think that like the the saunders of the world and a bunch of these other companies that didn't do so hot uh for the last two years i think they they absolutely can be started right now and i think it sounds crazy crazy to start him right now but i don't think it is even a little bit bro i loaded up on airbnb stock today oh my gosh i'm devastated i i'm seeing it go down what is it at now it's going down because the lockup period ended i don't know if you guys sold your shares or not but the lock-up period ended so people could start selling so put a bunch of downward pressure on the stock plus the market in general wait did it end i thought oh did it end i didn't even know i thought it ended in june that ends in june i think it's six months for something for i think for some insiders at least uh they can dump they can jump today why on earth would you ever dump airbnb stock right now but i bought it because uh hey i just i'm stupid i just buy stocks when i feel like it but b um i saw some data that was showing how a huge amount of airbnb bookings i think 28 30 percent are um actually i don't remember the percentages it's a very large percentage of airbnb revenue or bookings was coming from stays longer than 30 days now um which means that it's actually not vacation rentals only you know it's actually millennials just saying ah i want to stay here for a little while which is like i think a pretty big trend of i don't want to be i don't want to buy i don't even want a one year lease that's too much commitment how do i hop from place to place similar to what you did last year uh dude so many 28-day plus stays i think that is actually an interesting trend that people should take advantage of and we actually have a guy coming on the podcast um named bill smith i guess his name is like a real generic name he started shipped which sold for like 600 million dollars based on alabama it was like an instagram he's got this new company called uh landing is you know i'm talking about yes uh what's the url it's called like landing home or something home landing uh but anyway what it is is they lease out apartments in different places and they take the whole lease and then they sublease it because for people want to stay for a month and the thing about airbnb is that they actually charge what's the fee 10 if you're saying for two weeks if you're staying like in new york like i'm gonna be staying i'm moving to new york for three or four months uh it's prohibitively expensive so if my rent is 10 grand a month i'm paying a thousand dollars a month just in airbnb fees and so i could figure out how to reduce that fee to something that makes sense for the longer term i think that in the future people like us um and maybe a little bit younger i think it's gonna be incredibly normal to live somewhere for nine months and somewhere for three months right and so if they can figure that out it's huge but do you agree that like if you would you consider living somewhere for three months out of the year for sure i plan to do that yeah where are you gonna go like i got like a little baby right now so it's just a little bit tricky but yeah that's that's the lifestyle i'm gonna live is living in one place and then the other place for two to three months out of the year without sounding like a total douche is this a rich guy thing or do you think that like lots of people are going to be doing it well you could do it you could do it economically like i know a lot of people that did this and made money doing it right it wasn't a rich guy thing they went they live in san francisco predominantly and then they sub they they airbnb their san francisco place for a month and they go live in a you know mexico or south america and actually they make money for traveling because the san francisco airbnb costs more they're able to charge more for that than they pay in south america my lease or not at least my uh mortgage and insurance and everything at my house costs about 4 500 a month and i think that we're gonna get about 10 grand a month when we rent it out um and we're gonna use and then we're we've already booked a place we're living in brooklyn i'm living in brooklyn from july to september and so and i plan on doing that indefinitely and i think a lot of people are gonna be doing that as well cool um i gotta run i gotta get out of here but good episode we're out i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i never looking back

Shaan (@ShaanVP) and Sam (@TheSamParr) talk about an astrology app that has been creating controversy throughout Silicon Valley -- Sanctuary. VCs have come out against the app as pseudoscience, but the guys question their logic. These kinds of apps go into the bucket of "me-businesses" or businesses that tell the user about themselves. So from there, the guys brainstorm on ideas within this framework. The second half of the episode is focused on "personal monopolies" -- the concept of creating a big personal brand and monetizing it. We talk about a few people who have done it successfully and how you can too.

i think you could build a easily a hundred thousand plus person list doing this product and then there is a clear like premium offering on the back end but the the core of it is quiz funnel up top daily newsletter and get there and get to a hundred thousand i i would i'm on a throw down the gauntlet for somebody who's bored and looking for a project that will actually stick they'll actually get have some legs uh because i know this will have legs i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what all right everyone uh we're gonna talk about some good stuff in this episode but before you get to it can you do me a favor uh go to spotify and click the follow button the reason why is lately we've been getting way more listeners on spotify and i think it's because we're going up the charts but i want to be sure of that and in order to go up the charts i need you to click follow so it's gonna be like a big experiment i'm gonna reveal the results next time but go to spotify go to my first million and click that blue button that says follow click it for me please i'll reveal the results soon i think that's means we're gonna go up in the chart all right first segment we're gonna talk about horoscopes specifically there's a couple of companies that we talk about horoscopes.com astrology.com sanctuaryworld.com that make literally tens of millions of dollars a year talking about the horoscope business it's pretty wild because something like 50 of uh women in america are interested in that topic which i have no idea we also talk about judge judy and michael buffer i know that sounds weird you may not even know that name michael buffer his guy says let's get ready to rumble we talk about those two folks and how they make something like 400 million dollars i mean actually break down why they make that money and how you can replicate that and then finally we talk about two little side stories uh about side projects that shawn and i have we actually launched like dozens of products that we've never even these are our embarrassing side projects that we haven't talked about before that we uh reveal while we're talking about the horoscope thing they range from starting a crystal business which is just weird even saying that and they also to a a fan page that i made for pitbulls it's kind of odd and then finally i talk about a story about meeting tim ferriss and it actually happened when i was kind of high on drugs one time you'll you'll hear about it uh get to it uh it's in the episode like us on spotify see you at the end of the episode all right what's going on we were just talking about losing weight sean yeah you look good um how long have you been doing meat only meat only is only four days in but uh i had heard about this joe rogan talked about the carnivore diet and then uh it sounded [ __ ] ridiculous at the time then you started sending me you know nude selfies and you were like i was like damn sam's pretty stacked you're like yeah dude i'm just only eating meat i'm like what yeah yeah i'm only eating meat i was like the second person mentioned it and then my trainer was like he's like getting shredded for kind of his season or whatever and he's like i was like so what adjustments do you make he goes i just go to kind of a pretty much a meat-only diet protein only grass-fed ground beef uh grass-fed grass-fed beef some fish that's pretty much it a little bit of turkey and um so i was like well i don't know if this is gonna kill me later but i'll do it for two months so let's see if i if there's any noticeable change so we'll see well yeah i was just saying you look great you look uh you lost how many i mean i don't know like pounds isn't the best way to measure it but you probably have lost the equivalent of like 30 pounds of fat maybe 20 pounds of fat uh i don't know that'd be a lot my weight is the same or higher than it was when i started working out but my uh i do the dexa scan which we talked about which is that business where you go you lay down and it's like it just shows you kind of like where the fat muscle and bone is in your body sort of like an mr i don't know it looks like an mri machine but it's not an mri and uh according to that thing i've lost you know like i don't forget like i do it every three months and so the last three months i went down three or four percent body fat now i'm going down another four or five percent body fat this time so yeah hopefully we'll lose like 10 of my body fat so the first idea i want to discuss is going to start with a fitness story that's my segway but before we get into that you're going to do and so for the listeners uh we're going to do mini episodes i think you're going to try the first one right i don't remember what it's going to be but you wanted to do a rant on something and we don't even need to say what it was but we're gonna try a mini episode i wonder if it's gonna work it's gonna be probably five to ten minutes long maybe we'll see yep today we're gonna talk about um a horoscope idea which sounds silly but it's actually gonna be pretty awesome then we're gonna talk about judge judy michael buffer which is actually gonna be pretty awesome and then finally we're gonna talk about something that i've asked sean to prepare and it's about how he manages this team of interns to get a lot done i want to get right into it so i want to tell you the story about this guy named ross clark never heard you've never heard of ross clark probably that's okay so he kind of looks like me just a white hair blonde corn fed looking dude from uh i believe south carolina he was a triathlete and he used to do soul cycle and he would go to soul cycle and he loved seeing these women walk out of soul cycle with a glow they had a they had a bunch of cot they were very confident when they left and he thought to himself how do i make people feel like that i want to make people feel confident i want to make these these women feel great about themselves i want them to have a better life and so he thinks what can i do what can i do to make that happen and then it hits him and it's kind of a weird thing that hit him but he goes the best way that i can do this is i want to create a store or a brand that sells crystals and zodiac necklaces and t-shirts and customized birth charts and geos and smudge sticks these things that make women feel great kind of weird right yes and so that's what we're gonna talk about the first idea uh and he says he's gonna launch the like this brand that creates all these i consider them kind of weird kind of woo-woo and he goes i'm going to create a brand that sells all this stuff but first i'm going to start with horoscopes and that's the story of sanctuaryworld.co so i guess it's i think they just call it sanctuary the url of sanctuary world dot co and the reason we're gonna talk about it is they just raised a seed round of five million dollars is that correct yeah something like that so they raised five million dollars and it's caused a little bit of controversy because horoscopes are well they're [ __ ] they're [ __ ] in the sense that there's not a lot of facts behind them they're not real um but a lot of people buy into them thinking that they are legitimate in fact something like 40 of women check their horoscope on a regular basis and they they will make decisions based off their horoscope and the reason why i want to bring it up is because a it's interesting so um by the way what is this link to the soul cycle thing that sounds like who's this guy ross ross parker is that his name that's the story bro sounds like [ __ ] to me ross parker it sounds like he was like oh women believe this [ __ ] people men believe this [ __ ] i'm gonna sell this [ __ ] to them not i was standing outside a soul cycle i saw them glowing and happy and somehow i connected the dots between feeling good after exercise to selling crystals and horoscopes that doesn't make any sense to me it's it's a [ __ ] story but you told me what he's doing he's totally well i'll give you that he's connecting soul cycle he also in the article that i read he mentions headspace he's just name dropping right this is good he's trying to associate at one point he called it the uber for zodiac signs so yeah basically he's saying if i say three or four legitimate company names alongside mine i too will get the halo effect of being bucketed in with those guys all right i'm like meditation i'm like religion i'm like fitness yeah so that's what he did uh i mean calm calm.com calls themselves the nike of spiritual fitness so hey look we're like i i hate the game right all right i'm not gonna hate the player um so let me explain to you why this is uh interesting so josh wolf a guy that uh i like you like he tweeted this is [ __ ] whoever funds this idea is a crook um and i actually don't entirely agree with him i understand where he's coming from though and now i want to give you some background about this app the industry and where the opportunities are so the way this app works is when i read his tweet he goes this is this is josh wolfe on twitter he's a well-known vc he says seriously shame on anyone for funding or encouraging this [ __ ] no doubt there is demand but this isn't peddling entertainment it's encouraging slippery slope snake oil flap doodle we ought to desire informed educated rational and not naive gullible superstitious society and then he screenshotted all the investors who participated in the round i'm here for that shots fired although i disagree with what he said go on yes and so the way this app works i downloaded it it's actually beautifully designed and it sucked me in hardcore and you sign up you see like a sp dude i see the glow so i should have known it got me and you sign up you say what you know you click your jeff i'm a gemini i don't know what the other 12 signs are but you select your birthday and it says today is your daily reading for your horoscope uh it tells you like it's i got these like text messaging vibes so it feels like it's texting me this one or two sentence description of what i should expect and then it says by the way we want to tell you more in a few hours can you please turn notifications on so we can tell you more in a few hours about what's going to happen to you and they use this language that speaks exactly to me and then they say also we have a little bit more that we can tell you if you sign up here and then the way the app works is you can have this premium subscription where you get more info about you or you can stay for free where you get daily updates or now this is where it gets interesting you could pay a little bit more money and you could talk to a live what do they call themselves a mystic yeah a reader um you could talk to a reader and she'll tell you all about you so so basically we've talked about miss cleo and how she made like a billion dollars you get to talk to a miss cleo on the phone or via text and they're going to tell you all about what you can expect for the coming year the coming day yada yada yada now that in itself is not entirely interesting i mean it is pretty interesting but what's what's really interesting is how big this is so as two 30 something year old men we probably don't know too much about this but it's way bigger than i ever thought and the reason why i started diving deep into this is i started reading articles about the horoscope industry in a lot of like typical uh liberal high educated blogs that were written by women and i would have thought oh these women are gonna [ __ ] on it they're gonna say this is a scam and you know what all the articles were very positive right even in tech crunch it was this woman named sarah perez wrote about it and she goes yeah horoscopes aren't really harmful it's just fun meaningless entertainment whereas this guy josh completely [ __ ] on it and the reason why these women perhaps were okay with it is something like 50 percent of women check the horoscope on a on a monthly basis 37 said they check daily um i always get into these awkward situations my sister-in-law uh is a big believer in like the zodiac thing so you know a situation will be happening between her kids or we'll be talking and she's like oh such a tourist you know you're such a tourist or like well that's because well that's because uh you know they're gemini and gemini are this way and i'm always like you know i don't know how to respond to this because i'm like yeah yeah but like that's totally fake but yeah yeah that's super fake and true yeah okay good go on like i don't know what to say in response to that like i can't validate it or agree because i don't agree cuz who cares i don't i don't care if she believes uh it puts me i always say to them i say look if i was if i came on one second later at 1201 you're telling me that i'm gonna react differently about this or that just because of that one nanosecond or i always say well what if i'm born in australia where the hemisphere is different and the seasons are different and the moon's different but it's the same by the way in india they have this they have in india's like this times ten so if you think miss cleo was big and miss cleo was big miss cleo i think generated over a billion dollars in sales if you're if you watch tv in the 90s you know who miss cleo is if you don't you know um but uh in india they have this uh still on tv all the time there's these gurus these mystics and in every village even like the poorest villages in fact especially in the poorest villages because i think that's where superstition and religion is is stronger than anywhere else um you take your when your kid is born you take your kid to a uh kind of like your local stargazer mystic guy and he's basically he writes this giant thing on an act like on a scroll he gives you a scroll and the scroll basically says um don't let him eat yellow lentils uh it's just like all this like hyper like he shall not be married in the months of may june or august and so people literally i know that are like you know educated doctors lawyers bankers they'll be like engaged oh my god when's the wedding this summer they're like nah we can't do summer i was like why because my parents had this reading done when i was two months old and it told them that i shall not be married in these months of the year and so this is not just like an american thing it's a worldwide thing under many many different names um this is this is worldwide superstitions it's wild and well i'm going to tell you a little bit about the industry and some other people succeeding in the space but i think i couldn't find too much on these folks revenue numbers because they're they're relatively new so the way that the the company started was this young guy or he's i mean he's 39 he's ross clark or whoever i said his name was he he he was he went through lauren michaels the guy who started or runs snl he went through apparently he has a like a digital incubator i guess the nbc or someone sponsors it's weird it's weird and he went through it and now he recently raised five million dollars including i guess he raised money from nbc and lorne michaels somehow has a stake he raised money from advanced capital which advanced owns um loads and loads of magazines he raised money from uh graycroft which is a media investor so he's raised money from all these media people so this is like a traditional media company and or uh uh traditional media people like this type of stuff and the reason why they like this is horoscope business has been a large business for years and years and years i mean i've already just told you the numbers this is not niche i mean we're talking like a third of americans are into this [ __ ] um so astrology.com have you heard of astrology.com of course so they do low eight figures in revenue and the way that they make money is they have they do a lot of programmatic advertising so they do low-cost advertising like environment boolean operating they get you to come to their website and make a little bit of money off advertising uh they have ads on their website so it's an ad arbitrage play and then they also sell subscriptions so you do like a click this button and you're gonna get a little bit of an extra reading they make uh tens of millions load tens of millions doing that and it's been like that for like 30 years astrology.com horoscope.com horoscope.com is another competitor they do about 20 or they get about 20 million people coming to their website a month so it's quite large these guys have been around since like 1995 1999. so they've been around forever just making 10 million plus in revenue and kind of a pretty fascinating business my opinion about 15 million visitors a month to their website which is a lot that's a lot and i bet you a lot of that is direct or search which is really good um yeah so which way do you want to go with this so i i think we can do a couple things one is uh there's the controversy you know vinod khosla josh wolf they came out saying oh how how evil for funding this and for doing this there's so there's agree or disagree there well we could actually address that right away which is they're i totally disagree and they're [ __ ] they're wrong like let's like say like why would you ever invest in a nicotine business or an alcohol business like dude there's there's a place for all types of [ __ ] or a burger chain or netflix or whatever right like you can you can believe that uh there are sort of negative consequences for society and humanity for facebook as well right i think in this case their their sort of view is very tainted and here's the here's the easy example if somebody was doing a religion app they would be they would never say anything about this but because the religion is the stars instead of the gods um now it's snake oil now it's [ __ ] now it's you know peddling uh you know fake science what is religion what is the difference of religion right like it is a belief in something that is supernatural that is invisible that cannot be proved by science it is blind faith in something and that faith gives people comfort entertainment community you know like many like positive benefits and so if you're gonna say this about uh horoscopes you better also say it about religion otherwise i i view you sort of as a hypocrite there yeah we're on the same page there and also like dude i like many people they have a shitty live they go to work they get home at 5 p.m and they just want to [ __ ] veg out if if a little horoscope gives them a little bit of hope who cares uh you know we i need all the help i can get and i'm sure a lot of people do too so i don't care so i will i i'll say it's [ __ ] just like i think a lot of religion is sorry if you're religious but i respect that if you like it but i think it's [ __ ] too but it's okay me too um okay so then the second piece is uh that i'll just say on that is [ __ ] annoying the virtue signaling by vcs nobody like this the grandstanding that people do is so annoying to me and i recently we'll talk about this more in a month uh a weird teaser i know but we'll we'll go i'm gonna go in depth about a topic in a month about a fight i had on twitter uh a good old twitter ruckus and but one of the things that came out of it was the just absolute hypocritical uh nature of people and and virtue signaling this is almost more annoying to me than uh like cancer culture is virtu virtue signaling culture where uh people take any chance they get to say how they're greater than others uh because you know they sort of just go try to take the moral high ground at any cost and uh i find it to be so annoying and such a like weak move of people to do that so if you're an investor to go and say i'm a good guy i would never fund something like this um that is such an annoying move to me uh personally what do you think of that so i completely agree with you i mean like i think that we have to remember that like there's some mom like my mother in missouri who's having a hard day she needs to get off somehow like that sounded weird but you know what i mean she needs to like find her a little bit of happiness somewhere i don't care if she wants a soap opera or reads about horoscopes who cares not everything needs to save the world it just needs to be a little bit of fun and entertainment and not everyone needs to agree with you okay you don't want to fund it no problem you don't have to fund it but to like call out and demonize the people that do fund it let them do what they want uh like i find it weird that the people who are uh trying to be so like righteous they lose the one like kind of like one of the more fundamental things which is open-mindedness uh that maybe other people have different beliefs than you and will act in different ways in accordance of their beliefs and uh and that they should not be judged or demonized for it so anyways i think that's kind of annoying but okay so for all the people who like this let's talk about the opportunities and why this works you want to talk about that yes i have a couple okay i'll go first the first is myers-briggs and other personality tests you can do this exact same thing with that by the way the reason i bring this as the most interesting subject to anybody is themselves themselves exactly and so that's the that's the umbrella we're not talking about selling pseudoscience yeah that's actually like a technique why does this work is because the most interesting topic to me is me and the most interesting topic to you is you and so because of that if you if you accept that that is true which by the way it is once you understand that that is true it opens up a set of business possibilities that you can go through and work through and try to figure out uh so okay go on so the goal is to find so the reason why i went to this app why it was so interesting i bet so for most apps the free to paid conversion ratio is probably one percent maybe you think that's about right you can get higher you can get to like three four percent okay with this app i bet you it's as high as ten percent if you if they told me ten i wouldn't be surprised i'd be impressed i'm not surprised i would be impressed and not surprised exactly and at ten percent uh free to paid conversion rate is stupid that is so good the reason why is good is you could spend a lot of money to advertise now the churn might be high but that's a situation we could address after we're already big and popular there but so the reason why they're they're let's just assume that that is true let's say it's six percent um the reason why it's six percent is that it's so personal and the we the reason this business works is that it is personal so what you need to do is go out and find personal stuff so that's the reason why myers any type of personality test because i could say oh so you've just told me these 10 things about you that means that you're probably disorganized right let me tell you all about being disorganized and what that means personality tests are great it's actually the same in a way the same thing as a horoscope and what you can do is you could do it you could really just do a daily email if you wanted to sound really simple by the way all those people who are like um horoscopes huh like yeah that's for dumb trump voters to believe in and then they'll also be putting on their twitter bio like i'm an entj right they'll go put their like [ __ ] personality quiz results into their bio and i know there's slightly more science that you know that that says that that's a real thing but uh i don't know this is all yeah exactly this is all hand wavy [ __ ] as far as i'm concerned yeah and and guess what i'm in favor of it all right um i take these tests oh i enjoy them so i think that you can do a daily email for this um i also think that paid content paid subscriptions for these types of things works really well and what this app is doing that i particularly love that i think could work for so many different things is you get a top of funnel thing where you give these tests and then you do a come and talk to a person and you will charge 50 per person or per hour or whatever it is and as a middle person you take a cut i think that is brilliant by the way i was talking to um there was a company we talked about on here it's called i feel like it's called intro was it called intro it was basically like you can book a call with like justin bieber's stylist or like um oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it was called intro camera call no it was called something else but you oh maybe you're right so anyways dot com right uh founder's legit sold his last company he starts this thing he's like oh it's great because i'm remodeling my kitchen wouldn't it be great to be able to do a 30 minute call with the person who remodels kitchens on httv and so they got all these stars on and it's all good guess what vertical is the number one vertical for them astrology readings they found all these instagrammers you can go on instagram you could find all these people who have like cult instagram followings they have like 50 000 150 000 followers and they just post a daily sort of like you know reading and the people will pay to book time to get a personal reading from them it's taking off now he doesn't publicize that if you go to the website it still looks like it's about style home renovations and everything yeah and that isn't fitness but nutrition makeup fitness nutrition makeup all these things that you know smart people will nod their head and say that sounds good that sounds healthy uh then it's like what do people really want where's the where's the highest demand it was in the tell me about me through a reading either a psychic reading astrology reading whatever it is um okay i want to go back to something you said very quickly but i think is super legit and this is we need a sound effect for whenever me and you have such total conviction it's like in um if you watch like uh i don't know america's got talent or something like that or or the extra buzzer the golden button the golden buzzer where they're just like we don't need to vote i'm gonna push this button right now and you're you automatically advance so i'm pushing the golden button right now for anybody who wants to take this idea of um creating this this funnel so to do this you need you need to know nothing about code but you do need to be kind of like internet savvy and kind of clever here's what you do you and you should probably go and read like ryan hoover's book hooked near iowa or yeah ryan who was like the editor whatever sorry near or go and read um influence by robert exactly somebody who who gets into this stuff and is nonjudgmental they're not gonna do this forever but here's the experiment the experiment is you create a quiz that's the top of the funnel that basically says find out your personality find out your ex find out your myers-briggs find out whatever it is your horoscope whatever and uh you create a quiz at the top and then to get your results you put in your email we email you the results and then we send you a daily newsletter that's personalized to you right because you are a um because you were born on this day of this year i'm gonna give you your daily horoscope i'm gonna give you your daily reading and so that's the whole product right now uh i think if we do this i i will put put money in i bet sam would put money in too you put a little money behind the paid acquisition here and um and there's inherent virality because people will share their their quiz results they will share their readings especially when it says like see if you're compatible with your brother your girlfriend your mother whoever right you'll get somebody to share the quiz with somebody else so i think you could build a easily 100 000 plus person list doing this product and then there is a clear like premium offering on the back end but the the core of it is quiz funnel up top daily newsletter and get there and get to a hundred thousand i i would i'm on a throw down the gauntlet for somebody who's bored and looking for a project that will actually stick they'll actually get have some legs because i know this would have legs and i don't know how big a legs or but i do i would say with a high degree of certainty if you work on this full time for three years you have a five million dollar a year in revenue or even simpler right like a lot of people who who i when i surveyed my audience one of the biggest things was dude i'd love to just have a side hustle that i could do a few hours a day that would bring in a few thousand dollars a month this will do that so if you want to do this dm me email me email email us find out find a way to contact us because i want somebody legit to actually try this let me tell you uh about some experiments i've done in this area i don't even know if you know about these things so i don't know when it was not too long ago within the last couple years i was quite bored um i had sold my company and i basically said you know last episode you asked like do you want to build something that lasts for like 30 40 years like like a long-lasting company i'm like yeah sometimes i dream about that and then sometimes i dream about what's something i could do this weekend that would be fun and like i could throw away next weekend if i wanted to like a low commitment fling of a business just a fun scheme right a hookup and so i wanted i wanted a business hookup and yeah one night stand and i created thr i created three ideas that i thought would work the first was a iq test i always wanted to know my iq i don't know my iq i'd like to think i'm smart i think i'm above average smart guess what everybody thinks they're above average smart and so i thought why isn't there like an easier way to do an iq test why if there was an ad on facebook that was like a puzzle and it's like solve this puzzle and this is like the start of an iq test um i would go through that i would take the iq test for 20 minutes and then i would want to get my results i'd give you my email and i might even pay for like the full results of this thing so i thought that was kind of interesting doing iq tests and kind of like recreating mensa uh as a sort of like online funnel again no physical product needed no shipping no logistics no supply chain but a pure play sort of digital info product second one have you read the book the uh five love languages or five languages of love obviously okay yeah you're married so at some point you were given this book i've been like hey [ __ ] uh read this yes and so that's one that that's a pretty successful franchise so if you go look at my facebook page right now my facebook profile you'll see oh why is shawn the admin of a page called the love doctor well let me tell you why because i wanted to take the five love languages test put it online send people through that flow where they answer a bunch of questions and then say would you like to know what your love language is get put your email in and then i'll send you your results and then i say well wait we need to see who you're compatible with do your love languages match and do they know yours send this to your partner and um boom and then by the way like here buy the ebook buy the pdf that will tell you what to do given your love language because there's only like five so i can just make five pdfs and sell them so these are these little business experiment links and i have one last one that i did because as you can tell these types of businesses appeal to me i like simple lightweight stuff that people uh that has a lot of demand that silicon valley likes to pooh-pooh and say that they're they're better than that uh i find this as an opportunity so the last one is crystals uh you said something oh my gosh yes i did so this guy what he wants to do is he wants to sell crystals i don't like i i don't and i don't say oh my gosh and like i think it's wrong to say sell because um i think it's like anything that like you know tony robbins is he [ __ ] yeah but i read it sometimes it makes you feel like helpful so so who cares but i think crystals are nonsense yes exactly so so is a placebo a bad thing right if this thing has no measurable effects but i believe it to have a positive effect and it helps me feel better uh then has it not achieved its purpose of helping me feel better right so um so i looked at these three ideas and i had to pick one because i didn't have too much time right i had a weekend hookup to go to so i said should i do the iq one should i do this love doctor one the five languages love test or should i do this crystal thing as i looked at the crystal thing i saw i saw a bunch of interesting things which is that there's a lot of female kind of like influencers so adele carries a rose quartz crystal with her and uses it before ever before she goes on stage for every performance uh gwyneth paltrow from you know with goop she's all about you know these uh all about crystals um you know just go through the list of who's who so the kardashians after kim kardashian got mugged or robbed and she was feeling like very unsafe she uh like she credits crystals to being one of the things that helped her center herself calm herself and feel better about herself and be able to go back in the world feel safe again so i found that wow a lot of these sort of like female celebrities and idols have pictures and quotes with these i thought oh that'd be pretty useful to help sell this thing and then i found that i could source crystals uh very easily right the crystals are not that expensive and so i created a uh e-commerce store for crystals and i tried it for a couple weekends and i spent you know five ten grand of booting this thing up and i broke even and i even made a little bit of profit and in the end i sort of like got bored of the you know i got bored of the hook up and i was ready to move on with my yeah but i kind of validated that this idea could kind of work and there was it wasn't like gangbusters like look if they started printing money i wouldn't have given it up um no but it could have been i mean you only did it for a few weeks right like which is most things you have to stay at it for a bit to actually get it to work that's brilliant i like hearing these stories and i as i was thinking i made fun of crystals but i actually had something similar so there's this guy named ryan holiday you know ryan holliday the author of trust me i'm lying is that it yeah i might have it yeah the enemy i think is one of his right i have some of them up here and he's got many books and his famous thing is stoicism so he talks a lot about stoicism which basically just means how to be uh how to deal with the adversity how to be a tough guy obviously horoscope's mostly women this is probably mostly men and i read one of one of his books i thought it was nice it made me feel better about myself and i went to daleystoke.com and i bought a 30 coin that says some greek thing on there that's i don't even know what it says but it translates into like you live and then you're gonna die so like live well or something like that it's just and i would carry it i always like that dude who gets the uh the tattoo of an asian asian character on his arm and doesn't know what it means yeah i i don't but it doesn't matter like it means something to you yeah like it's uh got a like stoic on there they're supposed to be tough and i would carry it around me and i paid 30 bucks for it i think it costs a dollar for him to make i think make it a few million dollars so that [ __ ] works uh i dig it and by the way my my one night stand recently uh about a couple years ago as well our friend ramon was killing it on dog stuff i'm like oh my gosh that that looks so fun and so he would create all these facebook pages about uh dedicated to a specific dog breed and i go well that sucks fun i just want to tinker i'm going to try it i created this one page called bully boo so the word bully and then space the word boo b-o-o i just made that word up bully is a like a bully breeds they're like pit bulls uh whatever yada yada and i just went and got viral videos from reddit and i posted it on bully boo dude i got like 10 000 followers on facebook like in a matter of like five days yeah so that [ __ ] works um so anyway by the way i also have a pet one i heard this guy was making a bunch of money when he uh by printing your pet's photo on socks as a gift and uh i was like great weekend hookup tried it spun up the whole thing uh had a guy my friend eric who has this cool sock company called tribe he was like i'll print the socks for you you here's a link here's what here's here's an easy way to set it up tried it uh my results weren't great but uh same sort of thing where i was like i really enjoy these mini experiments and here's the thing like when i share these i think part of it is interesting of just hearing these little like random things most people listen to this i don't think do that i think we're somewhat unique in that we have done many of these right like i didn't even know you did this bully boo thing you didn't know i've done these three things there's actually like 10 more that i've done that you've done that we talked about so a lot of which are so embarrassing these are the ones we're talking about imagine the ones we don't talk about so um so i think one of the like meta takeaways is um like just experiment more and be willing to spin something up quickly and then throw it away when you when you're done with it and uh like don't try to like marry every everything you know it's okay to date it's okay to have a hookup or a fling or a one-night stand with a business and um i think that it's a lot of where skill is built so in doing that um i used to tell kind of one of one of my interns who was working with me on the crystal thing he was like dude i don't know if this crystal thing's gonna work but i'm just i'm amazed that in 48 hours we went from you were just bullshitting about the idea to our first sale and that's just kind of amazing he called it a flash brand he's like i love that we just created this whole brand it looks real it's got a name we like named it after my sister's kid um you know like we we we created a logo we got this like this shopify store spun up and in doing so we learned all these like mechanics of like how do you how like how do you get better at writing copy how do you get rid of naming things how do you get better at making a logo how do you use these tools like shopify and clavio and all these different tools that you need the piping to sell to sell stuff and i think that there's a lot of even if you think the ideas we're talking about are dumb it's not dumb to like use these as an excuse to go learn about facebook ads or to learn about building a facebook page quickly because that might come in handy again three days later or three years later when you're trying to do the next thing and of course that's not really what you're the most important thing you're learning what you're learning is the confidence to just go through the motion and get [ __ ] done in the same way that like it's a lot easier to get skinny when you know how to bench press properly or you feel comfortable squatting and you're like oh yeah i just do this this this and i eat less and boom i'm confident i can i just follow the i guess can i tell you a mini story on this real quick and then we'll move on um so i invested in that company maven uh which is started by our mutual friend uh guggen biani he started udemy and now he's got it which is a three billion dollar edtech company and now he's got a new edtech company uh for teaching online and i invested in the company in order to get in it was such a competitive deal in order to get in he's like look you guys have a good audience like um you have a big twitter following you gotta you gotta do a course if you if you agree to do a course be one of the teachers so be a user then i'll let you in the round and i was like done because i wanted to invest and so then he's been hitting me up like dude do the where's your course come on man make your course and so i was like all right [ __ ] and so then i and i was overthinking it and the lesson here is not it's really has nothing to do with my course um or i guess i'll tell the end of the story and then i'll tell you what how i almost [ __ ] up so the end of the story is yesterday i took about 20 minutes i wrote a three tweet tweet storm about how writing has helped me and uh i said you know in school i was a shitty writer uh in school they want you to write long essays like they have like a minimum word count you have to hit literally and you know you study shakespeare and you think that's what good writing is or you read the odyssey um but then you know in the real world it's the exact opposite you know you're paid to be concise not have a lot of words right you're not trying to write like really epic complex things you need to be simple and crisp and communicate well and i said i've gotten good at that so i sucked at school writing but i've gotten pretty good at real world writing through trial and error and studying some of the best people yourself included our friend neville i bought his course i took that whole thing i got better at copywriting uh but i said in general there's this whole like like how much value can be unlocked if you're good at writing emails tweets blog posts company memos investor uh letters like all those things can generate a lot of value it's made me millions of dollars uh i think it can do that for other people too if you get better at writing so anyways i tweeted that out and i said i want a package you know i've probably studied this stuff for like a thousand hours in my life i want to distill it down into something you can learn in 10 days if you're interested in that it'll cost 400 bucks um here's a link put it into a shitty google form where you put in your name and email and you tell me why you want to take this course so i've tweeted it out um guess how many responses i got 300. so i got a thousand responses already of people who are who gave me all their info that said i'd like to sign up to be in the first batch i thought so the way that maven works is they encourage you to do this to test demand to see if you have 100 people if you get 100 people they say all right there's enough demand you should go like kind of figure out why they want to do this and then then launch your actual course a thousand blew me away off of you know one tweet basically um let alone email list or anything else so i thought oh that's interesting wow like let's say that let's let's say that this is a thousand people the course cost four hundred dollars not all of them will convert but like two hundred maybe this uh but this was a hundred he said about thirty to forty percent of people will end up converting of but uh that's if once you qualify the list a little bit so but even this was just one tweet so let's assume i also email it out or i tweet again about it i think i could probably triple the size of the interest list because this was just whoever was on twitter in that moment that saw it so i could probably triple the size of this list and then let's say 30 of them convert 25 of them convert okay so let's say the net net is 120 000 i could easily make six figures i think 100 000 on the low end four hundred thousand five hundred thousand on the high end of this course okay so that's sweet but um what's the lesson here the lesson here is actually that i didn't i was not gonna send this tweet uh i was telling like governor's like all right you know you need to like test your test of demand for this course and i was like great uh so here's my plan i'm gonna first i'm gonna like work on the content of the course i'm gonna like make sure it's good uh and then actually i wanna like show people i'm good at this so i'm gonna do like 10 examples i'm going to do 10 emails showing me like taking something that was kind of bad writing and turning it making it better so that'll like get people interested and then i'll do it i'll mention it on the podcast and then i'll do this other thing and he's like dude you don't need to do all that like trust me just say hey i'm thinking about doing this uh you know here's why i think it would be good for you if you're interested sign up and i was like yeah [ __ ] you're right i'm doing that thing and that thing is what most people do which is you're afraid to fail so you overthink what you need to do to make it successful and abreu you're listening to this you're about to go to your own startup don't make this mistake that i was about to make that i've made many times in the past that most people make every time they go do a new venture is that they are afraid to fail therefore they um you know they they overestimate what they need to do to get started i need to incorporate i need to come up with a good name i need to buy the domain i need to like build it to make sure i you know i want to have a high quality product i don't want to go out with a bad product and disappoint people uh or you know i need to like create a whole website before i do this thing nope shitty tweet shitty google form 1000 responses right like you can get results with a much shittier sort of go-to-market and so you know the classic quote here is if you're not embarrassed by your by your first product you you by your first version of your product you waited too long to launch and so anyways i relearned was don't overthink it i i almost overthought it do you know what you're gonna teach are you gonna figure that out uh yeah i have a good idea actually i i think this would be cool so uh tell me what you think of this i haven't told anybody this yet so i think the way to get good at writing is to write obviously sorry it's the way to get good at anything is to do it um and so i'm like all right but i can't just tell you to go do it if if it was that easy you would have already done it um so i thought okay what about this what if every day i gave you a prompt so like let's say let's say the we want to get better writing uh writing for the real world right so let's let's say it's a cold email like the way you cold emailed people to come be speakers at hustle con great so i say we're gonna write a cold email to somebody who you want to come speak at your event um i'm not gonna tell you how to do it first try it take put 15 minutes on the clock and just try it write a shitty version um so they try it then i'm going to give them a like a kind of a learning so it's like do learn and then do so then i tell you how i would do it and with four examples like here's here's one way of doing it there's another way doing there's another way of doing it here's the common principles i'm using in all these all right you learned that good now do it again and you submit that one and i'll give feedback on all the submissions that people give and being like hey this is actually awesome or hey this is much better than your first attempt look in 30 minutes you just went from like really shitty to pretty good and here's how you can go from pretty good to like amazing if you made this one tweak additional so i want people to get uh daily reps at writing one of those things so it might be a headline right here's the story write the headline okay cool that's a that was a bad headline here's here's what goes into a great headline you better launch it again you better launch fast someone a listener is going to go and do this of course they don't have 150 000 followers but yeah if you want to do this help me do it i think it's just this should exist i think this would be a cool way for people to get better by actually doing something and doing it in like a controlled sandbox so not just saying open it i don't know go write a bunch of [ __ ] it's like very specific write this here's examples of what what what good looks like and then boom boom now that you know the now that you've learned the principle go apply it so anyways that's what i'm going to try to teach do you want to talk about michael buffer yes what do you so on our doc sean's got michael buffer and judge judy personal monopoly written down there i'm very curious what that even means so this started with just curiosity i was watching the um canelo alvarez boxing match that happened last weekend fun match guy when he [ __ ] broke this guy's face he's like close together broke his book his face in three places and then the guy quit between rounds so anyways boxing is this funny thing where like the match itself only lasts for you know some number of minutes but they need to charge you all this money for a pay-per-view so there's all this like pomp and circumstances all this parade around it right they walk out with music and their kind of entourage and their outfit and then the next person walks out and then there's the introduction and in the introduction there's always this guy you've probably seen him it's this white guy who basically is like got a great voice and in boxing he says um like you know ladies and gentlemen let's get ready to rumble right that's like the signature thing uh like he you kind of get wired over the years of following the sport that like yes this is the main event this is the big one and by the way do you know who that guy's brother is bruce buffer right so bruce is in the ufc and he says i'll let you do it he goes it's time it's time and by the way they didn't know that they were brothers until they were like both in their 50s exactly crazy story so so i so i i was just watching this and i was like how much does michael buffer get paid right so i do the search michael buffer salary guess do you know how much you might know it sounds like you know some things no i i don't know but 10 million a year so michael buffer has made 400 million dollars uh in his career doing what he's doing he's made most of that off of the the fact that he has created a personal monopoly he is synonymous with a big boxing match and his phrase let's get ready to rumble is a trademarked phrase now how is it a trademark and he's trademarked and he licenses it out to video games to um you know like movies and shows and stuff like that and actually if you go watch uh like the back catalog of ufc fights they cut out bruce buffer's it's time part because they don't want to pan the royalty on its time how well first of all i knew he was wealthy because he looks like he's got a lot of work done on his face so like he's got that like wayne newton look where like sigmund freud where i'm like oh that's that las vegas rich look and uh the second how on earth does the boxing federation or whatever it's called allow him to own it along with bruce buffalo so the way this happens so the way it happened was michael buffer is the is the the announcer guy right and at first he's not making much and boxing is kind of nascent and he's he grew with the sport right so tyson got popular and holyfield and all these big names you know you just keep seeing this one guy for like 30 years so he ended up building his own brand you know along the way so nowadays he gets paid about um or sorry i don't know exactly what michael buffer gets paid per event but he he got to the point where it's let's say 1984 and he's saying let's get ready to rumble and uh bruce buffer uh who doesn't know that they are siblings he is half uh they're half sibling so he's watching um what is it he's watching the event or something like that and he sees that this guy's last name is buffer and he goes oh that's cool i've never met another buffer he doesn't think they're brothers he just thinks this guy's last name is also buffer that's cool i've never met another buffer he goes on the yellow pages and he looks and there's no other buffers so he's like dude this is crazy this guy's last name is buffer and he's driving with his dad or something like that and he asks his dad he's like yeah this guy's uh oh no he finds out he so he looks into michael buffer he finds out he was um he grew up in a town like i don't know half a mile away from bruce he's like dude dad how crazy is this this guy you know that guy on the boxing thing michael buffer he last name buffer and he grew up uh you know half a mile half a mile away from us and the dad while driving just goes yeah i think that's your brother he's like what he's like yeah you know you didn't know this but before you and your mom you know they've been married for 50 years before you and your mom got together uh you know i had another i had a son i don't know if it's him but maybe that's your brother and so they go and they find out that they are actually half brothers they share a dad so bruce then goes to michael and he says michael you're doing great um but you have no like business manager i'll be your manager and he's like okay what does that mean he goes dude you need to trademark this phrase this is your catchphrase so he applies for the trademark he gets it and then he basically says uh takes that trademark and he starts licensing it out merchandise you know hats shirts video games everything so he starts building this guy's brand and then later michael gets bruce into the comment the announcing game and bruce becomes the announcer for the ufc so a different sport and bruce is making like on any given event if you go watch a ufc event he's making 50 to 100 grand for that night's work which is basically before every fight he just announces you know in this corner we have this guy right now he makes hundred grand for big fights and fifty grandish and this you're like we got a caveat this is like you know when you google someone's net worth like i don't know if this is actually his number this is like the this is the it's in a bunch of articles but maybe they're all referencing the same shitty source i don't know right and he does probably three a month yeah so you're looking at about three and a half four million dollars a year and it says that you know his net worth net worth is sort of in the tens of millions uh whereas michael buffer is in the hundreds of millions uh and so this sort of came to this concept of creating a personal monopoly so how do you build yourself to the point where you are unreplaceable um where and this is like um ryan seacrest with american idol right when american idol first started there's two dudes and at this point ryan seacrest actually go ahead well i was just gonna say ryan seacrest is now you know sort of synonymous with american idol uh it's like chris harrison with the bachelor it's jeff probst with survivor and you know these are these are hosts that on the surface it's like oh he just comes out here says a few lines anybody could do that no it doesn't take any time no no the fans grow attached to this person and that becomes part of the brand of the event um and the consistency of seeing those same faces the same recurring cast members saying the same catch phrases is part of what makes it popular so judge jude and at this point ryan seacrest has ryan seacrest productions which is a production company which frankly i've always been wondering like what does a production company actually mean like that that's one of those hollywood terms that i'm sure it doesn't confuse me i don't get it but it does something like north of 100 million in revenue well he produced the kardashians show keeping up with the kardashians he was the creator and producer of that show i think so uh it was his idea so he parlayed that into something i don't i don't exactly like i said i don't entirely understand that there's this company on the road because at the beginning of american idol there was two hosts and one guy after season one was like oh this is a hit i want more money and at that time he didn't have a personal monopoly yet he was replaceable because the show was so new and so they said no thanks we'll keep ryan ryan you could just be the lead guy now and ryan seacrest did it for like 15 years and then by the end of it was sort of making i don't know 10 15 million bucks a season doing it because he waited until he became entrenched in the franchise as like the face and he became a valuable character like simon cowell and the other guys so judge judy is probably the greatest example of this so the highest paid person on tv was judge judy for a number of years she was making 47 million dollars a year for i don't know 50 i think days of filming so she was making about 900 000 a day uh filming the show for judge judy which is she was a judge before that making 113 000 a year and so from the commodity the skill of the job of being a judge to building your personal monopoly as the show is called judge judy she was able to turn 113 000 a year of of uh pricing power into 47 million dollars a year and then you know cbs bought the back catalog of judge judy for 100 million dollars so she's still making royalties without working anymore so i just find this to be tremendously interesting it's something that was counterintuitive to me seems to me like all these people are replaceable but clearly the economics of hollywood show that they're not and um and so i just found this to be very interesting i also like the story of you know the long lost brothers one brother finds the other becomes his manager convinces him to trademark it and that trademark is you know that building that personal monopoly of ip is what helped him build a multi hundred million dollar franchise so i thought that was amazing so i would let's go down the strap hole i don't think we're gonna get to the intern thing but maybe we will um let's put on the shred hole because i know a few people that have these personal brands maybe some people think that i have that but i i actually don't have it because i'm not nearly careful enough but you're you seem quite careful enough uh about your brand that you might uh you you have this but who comes down i know tim tim ferriss i know tim ferriss i know jack butcher jack butcher is a great friend of mine um he created this huge following off of visualize value great name all he does is he makes one picture that describes a thousand words so basically you have this complicated topic he makes one graphic a day and it explains exactly how it works you would think that's silly he's crushed it he probably makes two to three million dollars a year uh selling a course on that topic the second one tim ferriss and the reason why i can't do this is because these guys are so protective and particular about their brand tim ferriss i'm gonna tell i'm gonna tell tim ferris story that i i don't want to turn this into clips i don't want this to get popular but i'm going to tell a story so tim ferriss years ago came to my office when it was when he had justin i i know tim ferriss because he would walk his dog we were neighbors we lived down the block from each other we would walk our dogs together like he would be at the park and i would be at the park and i wouldn't bring up business i wouldn't even act like i was a fan other than i'm saying hey i just listened to this podcast the other day was wonderful good job uh anyway can you tell the first time y'all met how did you because i think when people meet somebody that they know and admire they often blow it by totally fangirling over them uh what was the story do you even remember like what was the first interaction where it became okay the funny story is i was on the way home from the hospital after getting a kidney stone and i was super high on morphine i had gotten a kidney stone and my wife sarah who was my girlfriend time was driving me home it was 8 am because i got the kidney stone at like 5 o'clock in the morning i was coming home eight a.m i see tim walking in front of my house and i was on the passenger seat riding dirty with my seat back and i was all high and [ __ ] and i see him walk by and i go hold on sarah back up hey hey tim what are you doing around here man and he goes i live down the street i go that's cool i'm a big fan uh just got a kidney stone he got any tips for that and uh i was like oh obnoxious and then i saw him again the next day walking his dog and i go tim i just wanted to apologize i was under the influence but uh anyway i know your books uh big fan um what's what's your dog saying yeah that's it right and then we would just we would just talk about dogs that's all and then eventually he uh cold emailed me months later when he goes hey i heard about the hustle it seems cool do you want to have dinner so we could talk about it i go to dinner and he goes wait a minute you're the guy with the dog i go yeah man what's going on it's me sam i'm your neighbor i didn't ever want to bring up email or business to you because uh you know i don't want to be tacky so it was a weird thing that we knew each other and so one day he after he invested in my company he comes to the office he sees me drinking a coke cereal and he goes hey man can i have one of those i go yeah dude you have as many as you want let me go get you one i give him one and he chugs it super fast he goes did i get one more i go yeah i got two i brought them two chugs we get done with this meeting there's six of us in the office i'm in we're in a little baby conference room which is basically a one bedroom a bedroom in one of the apartments there's about six of my employees or four of them and then sieva was there and he goes all right well that's a good meeting and he pushes the coke cans my way and i go what he goes you mind throwing those away for me and i go yeah yeah i'll come away and i take him and he just didn't want to be seen walking out with a diet soda can that's how particular this guy was and you know what i think it's great i dig it and whenever we work with tim um if i write something and there's a miss comma or something he's on top right and at first i was like you know you're really being a pain in the butt and then i realized you know what you're not being a pain in the butt you are being tempted you are being exactly how you should be you are protecting your brand you want things in a very particular way you're being demanding and i respect that and i like that and that's when i realized i don't think i could ever be a personal brand because you have to guard that [ __ ] like crazy you have to be on top of it every single time it has to be uh it's got to be exactly a very particular way every single time and that's how you build a really good brand um you have to be on when you're on i mean i'm sure there's a phrase i use i i don't know if i made this up or somebody told me this i have no idea it was a long time ago 10 years ago it's called epoch epoc it stands for every point of contact it said if you want to make a great brand you need to be congruent so you need to have something you stand for all right most people don't know what they stand for they're not clear about it it's not unique it's not compelling it's not um it's not something notable but once you do that the second step is at every point of contact you have to embody that right so you can't be before our body and be out of shape right you can't be like you know for our work week guy and then you know you're super inefficient and you're working 80 hours a week so so you have to be congruent at all times and that's that should be the goal as a brand is to at every point of contact a customer has with you in any any place they're getting that same they're getting that same thing that you stand for and um and so that's that's like an aspirational goal of course you don't do that it's not it's not achievable but it is a mindset to have in order to reinforce the brand many many times because people will have experiences with you right this is like disney world disney world has all these things right where they're like you know there's no um i forgot what all the things are it's like there's no trash cans and there's no like uh you can't see the mascots ever taking a smoke break with their head off you know you can't see mickey mouse smoking a cigarette it's like no we have to be at every point of contact this place stands for joy then everything's got to be joy right the bathroom's got to be joy the food's got to be joy right like all these different things um that's what great sort of brand owners are or strive to do and what you and i do or at least i know i do it is um i test stuff with people and so in a way we have a podcast i mean i would say we're actually what you see is what you get i mean we i you and i talk like this regardless if the camera's on or not but um i do know like which jokes hit and i'll test them on people right i kind of see like oh this story i just told it caught that guy's attention i should tell it a little bit differently though and with tim and other people i've seen them repeat phrases like um uh i don't pretend to be a doctor and i don't play one on tv right like that's just like this phrase that he uses and i guess it kind of and yeah you're so likely yeah yeah and and and these phrases that i've seen these quote famous people so a guy like tim who else do i know that's like fits this category jack is definitely one of them um jack butcher um i've told the story before on the pod but chris saka did this and it blew me away i met him in person and for those who don't know chris hawk is like one of the best investors ever to a point where he's already retired he doesn't now he only invests in climate change stuff because he's like already i already won the game of like money and success he's it's called post-economic yeah he's post-economic as biology taught us uh so i met him in person and he told this story and as i was telling the story he had all these little offhand little moments where he's like he's like you know i didn't i didn't realize that that at the time um or like he'd be like he'd say something he'd correct himself and he'd be like blah blah well i guess no that would mean this but blah blah blah oh but he used that line i saw him on cnbc one day and he said the same [ __ ] thing the exact same [ __ ] way like a comedian does in their sets where a comedian if you go up there and it feels like a comedian has said this joke a million times they're bored of it then it's not funny but a comedian has to sort of like it's almost like they're realizing or telling this story for the first time that's when it really hits and so i saw him do that and i go oh there's levels to this [ __ ] like not only do you have to be able to be good at it this is like this is like comedy this is like storytelling this is like this is like a play you know a broadway show that goes on on stage every night and there's a new person in the crowd and they have to do it like it's the this is a tuesday night but no this is our open this is our best performance ever this is the first time we've ever done it this show matters the most and we repeat our lines and i thought oh wow i've never even thought about that but yeah i guess it makes sense you could kind of craft these stories that hit and you could tell them over and over once you have them that's in your bank and you can i tell this story people feel this way about me and um that's cool so i'm gonna try and bring this back to the brand thing but before i do um another way that you can see this is when you're pitching stuff so when you're pitching your company to people you have to and i mean i did this well when i when both when i was selling the company if i was ever trying to raise money if i'm ever trying to convince uh i you know i do when i am on other podcasts or and also when i um i'm hiring someone i've got the same pitch and i look at the inflection of my all right i i look at the person's eyebrows and i look at their body language and see where i get them to lean in and i get it i see where i get a full backwards and you gotta find these hooks and you constantly got to throw them out and you got to see what what what bait works and then you just rinse and repeat and he was like ooh that line right or when i said i want to be like ted turner [ __ ] they didn't know who ted turner was okay what else do i got yeah you wanna exactly exactly um so to bring it back to judge judy uh i don't know how i'm gonna yeah bring her back to jesus let's just move on uh anyways cool story about michael buffer and judge judy if you didn't know they made a bunch of money uh and you know it pays to have a personal monopoly all right that's the podcast i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like my days off on the road less travel never looking back

didn't think that i was low energy dude some days i'm just like having a sluggish day bad day i get on this call and i just i get your guys energy that just like helps me get through the day and that's funny no i feel horrible i didn't sleep well i mean i just feel i do feel sluggish i just didn't i had a bad night's sleep that's so funny that that radiates that sucks i thought you i thought you were fine but you usually have one or two moments in the episode that are like the sam moment where you like get really either excited or you think something's really dumb and uh yeah so so that didn't happen but let's talk about some stuff you want to talk about peak did you invest in peak i did when uh over the weekend i talked to him maybe friday and on the first call i was like and i was actually quite skeptical of this so this will give people the context uh this is one of the first ideas that we've ever discussed as this new scheme i think literally episode maybe one or two of when we started doing the brainstorm sam goes trt subscription and i was like what what he's like uh so i've been taking testosterone trt is testosterone replacement therapy i've been taking testosterone and i think this could be a great business um because you know if you take it it helps you you're gonna keep taking it on a subscription like you were talking about why the business might be great and we were both like dude that's a great idea why doesn't somebody do this and obviously people were already doing it and so you recently were like hey is this company peak that i'm investing in that does that testosterone thing you should talk to them and so i did and i went in with honestly kind of like lukewarm uh expectations i don't know why like i i don't know i just didn't like i didn't know how big it was going to be i didn't really know like i i myself i don't take it because i'm like i had some concerns like is this really good for you or bad for you blah blah blah and then i was totally convinced on the call the guy was the guy sod who you introduced me to is an amazing communicator like this guy was so good at selling me on the business i was like you're gonna sell everybody your product if you can sell me this well on your business uh he was a really really talented guy yeah he he is talented it's a it's a really it i think it's a pretty safe bet is what i think i think it's i think it's a safe bet but i there so basically trt is uh i believe it you know i should know i put it in my body but it's i believe it's synthetic testosterone and you can put it in via like you can rub it on your body we should explain the problem right which is that yeah males uh you know as you age in general your testosterone levels go down right so in your 20s you're the stallion and then by the time you're in your 40s your testosterone levels are you know i don't know multiples less than they were in your 20s okay that's just nature taking you know that's father time okay but there's also like other issues which is that today a guy in his 20s and 30s has the testosterone levels of like a 70 year old man 50 years ago or something crazy like there's there's some stats there's a lot of reasons to why why that's the case although uh doctors and scientists they're like well we don't exactly really know but it could possibly be that we live like pretty soft lives like there's not that much fear or like compared to like we don't have a death threat on a regular basis or a dying of different diseases although maybe that's different the last two years we um we um drink plastic we or we drink out of plastic what else did they say we we smoke less which a lot of people think nicotine and uh just testosterone levels are are correlated uh and there's a variety of other reasons but basically the average person's t level the average per the average boy man they're the 25 year old is like that of like a 56 year old yadda yadda and what that means is a lot of guys think well testosterone okay so you're just gonna have big muscles and look good naked that's kind of actually kind of like a secondary thing the first thing is that you actually become incredibly depressed and like bummed and you just don't feel like i call it like aggressiveness but it's not really like i want to fight you aggressiveness it's like i can i'm like a little bit more confident and i have a purpose anyway um i got tested for this and i had a low t and i tried a lot of different solutions so i tried this company it's pretty great i i think it's i think it's a i think it could be pretty cool i think they're doing pretty big numbers already we'll see if they can pull it off i think a company like a testosterone business this is one of those companies i think sean you said it one day where you're like there's a bunch of different risks here there's technological risk like can you actually build it there's market risk like does the market actually want this um in this case those two things aren't risks the third risk is operational excellence uh are you competent enough to pull this off and that's the risk that they have and i actually think that's a that's a pretty easy risk because that's a commodity i mean there there's there if you overpay a handful of uber employees they're gonna figure out the problem yeah you go find the guy who opened up uber's like atlanta business and you're like yeah i need uh you you're you are an operational person i need you to come here and solve this problem by the way i think i've invested in four companies and like on the founding team of each of them was like i opened up uber in chat i ran uber's canada business i went there first to open it i became the gm or like there's an uber competitor uber for flowers right bloom that i invested in the guy who like ran that because it's like these guys have operational excellence they just need to find a good market that uh really wants a product so i think you're right that the market does want this but there is you know an education step that has to be done product yeah they have almost zero products um but it really is about regulation and operational excellence so do they have regulatory risks and do they have operational excellence because you have to properly handle it right the flow is they don't just give testosterone to anybody you take a test so you at home finger prick you send the blood to the lab the lab you know it gets reviewed by a doctor and the doctor says yeah your levels are great or your levels are low and if your levels are low we can offer you a prescription if you want and um and then when you get the prescription they need to keep measuring over time to see if your levels are improving or not and that sort of thing and so there's a big kind of like time lag it's not just like you know buying a thing off amazon or two days later it's at your house and there's no risk in in playing with that toy it's like no there's risks this is actual medical it's a medical it's a digital medical workflow and those are new so like all of the telehealth um products are like this hymns and rho are probably the most successful versions of these where they took viagra and they said okay how do we market to people who might have erectile dysfunction how do we get them a prescription how do we so how do we pair a person on facebook who sees our ad to a doctor who can prescribe them you know that they had that they had diagnosed them with erectile dysfunction and prescribed them a medicine and how do we create the generic version of viagra how do we take this product and how do we sell it and then how do we do that whole thing profitably right so similar similar mindset those have become multi-billion dollar companies and i think that there's more to come in that vein i've invested in a couple peak being the latest but yeah i think this is great and you like you said the thing i would have been worried about was twofold one uh does this really work and what are the side effects and as he was talking me through it i was like okay well you're very convincing but obviously you're somewhat biased right here like the owner of this company uh but he started as a user of the product so so i think it is somewhat organic um but i was like okay that sounds good i'm gonna do some independent research and i'll figure this out for myself too the second thing was i didn't like the idea of injecting myself in the butt or i don't know where do you where you interest yourself the thigh i put it in my thigh and it doesn't hurt at all i do it two days a week and why don't you take the gummy or like the cream that seems like like a gummy seems way better than a shot i got used to it and i didn't want to deviate uh i had a provider that only did the shot and i just was like yeah i'm used to it it also like feels like it's going to work better i don't actually know if it does and i asked him this i go i go he said he has all three and i go why would anybody choose the shot he goes actually if you look in popularity our shot is the most popular and the second is this and the third is this and i said is that because it's more effective and he goes no it's not more effective in fact the cream is the most effective but uh but people believe there's a there's a perception that the shot oh this is i'm doing the real thing i'm getting the full effect of this and i thought that's funny how that like perception is reality yeah so i like it but i've been doing it for a while and um this isn't like a peak uh commercial we could and so we'll just be explicit about this shawn and i both have a financial incentive in this company we are both investors of this company but uh it's sick we've been talking about trt for a while i'm a fan and uh i've been taking it now for two or three years um it changed my body i didn't take it from my body but it changed i think they'll be at 100 million in sales in the next three years that's my my prediction my bet yeah i believe that the question is who buys it and um i don't know yet i mean it's a pretty taboo thing so they got to fight some taboo uh stuff but uh yeah we'll see i mean because people when they say they're like oh you're taking steroids and i joke i'll be like yeah i take steroids it's not actually steroids right it's not an anabolic steroid steroid um but they do they've got some they've got a little bit of culture uphill battle to fight but i think people are going to be open-minded to this actually far more than i ever thought i know a lot of people who take trt and i was shocked that uh that that many people do i thought i was gonna be the only one especially because joe brogan aka the male oprah does it and vouchers for it i think that goes a big way like that guy has like a pretty massive mainstream following and uh when he normalizes something uh it's just a matter of time you know first his die-hards will go do it and then the other people get curious and start to check it out and eventually as it gets more popular people will remember that joe vouch for joe does it so you know i think that goes a long way just like oprah had a big effect on a lot of businesses i think a person of joe rogan's magnitude is actually not just any other influencer do you want to talk about some of these ideas that you have you've got some amazing ideas do you want to talk about zed that's crazy let's talk about zed okay so we both uh we mentioned zed on the pod before why don't you explain what it is and then no you do it it's so it's this is like perfect for you this is like a you this is like a sean company okay it's it's really simple zed is a uh it's digital horse racing so if you've ever been to a horse racing track super fun you know saturday sunday experience you go to a track there's a bunch of horses you don't know anything about horse racing that you don't know anything about the strategy you look at the sheep you know what do you do at a horse racing event you sort of drink and you bet and um and so the betting part is there's eight horses that are about to run you don't know anything about any horses you look at the names and they all got funny names like you know um you know mother's last hope or something like that and then you're like you know what i think mother's last hope might win i'm gonna bet 50 bucks on mother's last hope 90 on uh you know uh sam park ponytail and then the last one you know is like whatever me lucky charms and so you bet on three horses out of the eight the horses run across you're cheering like crazy you just want your horses to win they maybe they do they maybe they don't and uh and whatever it's a good time and so horse racing is almost like the purest form of gambling because you really don't there's really no strategy that you don't need any skill or strategy but you're safe because really the other people also don't have any skill or strategy so it's not like a poker table where if you don't know what you're doing you'll get taken advantage of um horse racing is very simple in that way so what zed did was they brought that online okay well that's that seems kind of niche the smart thing was they brought it online in the crypto format so the way it works is um it is a crypto project it is an nft project which we talked about before so you go on zed and you can buy a horse so you can uh you can buy a horse or you can breed two horses together and um and so you'll have a horse and then you can race your horse and then your horse can win for you or he can lose for you it's sort of like a little tamagotchi pet of yours and um and every horse has like these characteristics so there's like a probability when you breed your horse or when you buy your horse there's like a probability it's gonna be like a small fraction of chance it's going to be the lebron james of horses it's so athletic it's just going to win every race and then there's a probability it's going to be average or below average and so there's a gambling aspect just in the breeding and buying of horses not just the races themselves and so people are going on there they're cold they're buying and collecting horses like their pokemon and they race them against each other and they win money and these guys are crushing it so yeah so this what sean just said so the url is zed dot run so z e d dot run well he just described it sounds kind of silly and looks like it is silly i guess like oh i guess gambling is silly but whatever it's fun and and the artwork is cool and what he just sounds sounds like a small idea but their numbers are a stop are astonishing so go ahead what are the numbers they uh they sell horses like in a in a batch so it'll be like you know in june they'll do like a drop of new horses that you can go buy and so they just did a drop a few days two days ago i think three days ago so they did a drop and um it was 18 million in digital horse sales so they sold 18 million dollars of digital horses to 2400 buyers uh the top spender paid about eight hundred thousand dollars and the top hundred spenders spent eight point three million dollars and um and so what's up what's happening here under the hood is that there's a group of people who are investors and they believe in nfts they love to gamble and one one of my friends is those guys uh well joe we'll just say joe he he spent six figures on it that's amazing we're gonna have one of the biggest whales on the pod i forgot to tell you this the uh one of the biggest whales in this whole space in the nft space reached out and he has a crazy story and he's like i'd love to come tell the story on your pod so so we should have him on he will go in more in depth with him there but my understanding is that there's these people that were really big into daily fantasy like they played draftkings fan duel and these were the whales there and then you know they were doing daily fantasy for a while and then top shot came out nba top shot and they went heavy into top shot they bought a bunch of top shot things they were buying and selling from each other and i was driving up the prices and um and they had these huge top shot collections and now topshop was worth a lot more money and they did well there and then they said all right great what's the next top shot and they went to zed run and zed run is the next top shot and so so that's what they're doing 18 million where do the proceeds go so i think it goes to zed i don't think there's anybody else to go to here so i think zed basically mints the horses and uh and they they buy them so that zed gets the sort of initial sale and then from there um you know if i sell my horse to you i can i get the proceeds of that sale then from from there there's maybe some transaction fees so i think that's it i don't think there's any other like i don't think there's miners and other stuff involved but that could be wrong who puts up the pr and then when you buy your horse and then what's the likelihood that your horse is going to win a race is is it do they establish you basically when you're buying a horse you're buying you that probability that it's going to win i'm i'm out of my peg right here i don't know exactly how the horse racing probabilities work you know how does the slot machine work i'm not exactly sure i just know i pull the lever and look for looking for cherries so so it's crazy so let me tell you i'll give you some inside baseball here sean talked about told me about this uh 60 days ago maybe uh your friend narendra told us about it told both of us about it yes and you brought up a podcast and this was was this 60 days ago maybe two months ago and you guys described it and i was like this is silly but shawn's been pretty spot on with some of this stuff narendra has been spot on as well he was early on clubhouse even you know he he he sees [ __ ] and i contacted the founders of zeb and i got him on the phone and i spent like an hour talking to him and they're raising money and i was like i'm in they're gonna let me invest and they took a week and they said no we don't have either i did it it was a vague either like they don't have room or they're not sure if they're gonna raise um regardless well that's cool um but it's pretty nuts the amount of interest that they've been getting and the founders were really cool guys and i was devastated i didn't get you can get in you guys are listening call me um but it's it's pretty crazy like how much interest that this company is getting yeah exactly um and so so you know i was i almost bought a ten thousand dollar digital horse over the weekend because uh i wanted to get in before this drop and i just got busy with mother's day stuff and then didn't get around to it but i think you know i don't know if there's a good investment or bad investment i would my personal opinion is that this is going to have a hype cycle and the price is going to go up it's going to be like oh my god there's you know this company's done 300 300 million dollars of digital horse sales and then you know 400 days from now um we're going to be like remember zed run that was that was a fun four weeks kind of like big clout kind of like big clout kind of like top shot kind of like clubhouse right like this is not uncommon and it's not really even a knock on them like look they did better than 99 percent of startups that don't get a hype cycle but um i don't see how much longevity there is here because it's the trick is when the primary value is speculation then it's hard for something to sustain and in here it's like primary value number one is speculation i'm gonna get this horse i'm gonna sell it for more primary value two is a game and both games and speculation uh you know sort of uh fade over time um with everything except for bitcoin because for bitcoin the speculation is actually what makes it valuable um you know people speculate that the price will go higher the higher the price goes the more it actually is a store of value so the speculation actually creates the product whereas that's not the case for zit do you ever ask yourself how are we going to build or how you know how individually how do we make stuff on the internet that can actually last 20 30 40 50 years because you think of the things that are in the top uh 50 companies right now most of them i bet that are tech based are launched inside the last 15 how's google 20 years old um ish yeah year 2000 maybe or 96 so 25 yeah everything's so new and changes so rapidly do you ever ask yourself how are you going to create something that can last a long time or you not care about that i don't really care about that what i do care about i guess like my view is that you've got to go on either end of the spectrum either you try to build something that's going to be really defensible and valuable and really what what i mean so for me it's not about something lasting over time it's this one theory which is um does it have a positive flywheel which means the more people who use it and the longer it's around does it become more and more valuable there's some something called the law of increasing returns and so i want to be in a business that's like that might be hard to get turning explain that what does that mean yeah so like an example of it is as many but let's say amazon or amazon is the classic example of this so what makes a shopping store valuable a store is valuable if it has large selection low prices and fast delivery so with amazon for every single customer that comes on for every single product that they add to it they're increasing the variety available to that customer because they have so many customers they can offer the lowest prices and because they have so many customers and so much uh like um built up you know sort of supply chain infrastructure to behind their thing they can offer the fastest delivery and so for them every new customer or every new merchant is just like it's kind of like you used to say with the hustle every email is a win you know we're a pirate ship and every email subscriber is a little wind in our sales it's that but basically it makes it better for everybody else the classic example of this is facebook right so every person who joins facebook makes facebook more valuable to all the other people on facebook and so in the beginning when facebook has zero people on it it's not very valuable to anybody even the first 10 people is not very valuable to anybody but once it gets every additional person the thing gets more defensible over time it gets more valuable to its existing customers which makes it harder for anybody to compete and they don't have to do a new thing they don't have to come up with a new idea or a new business line like all they had to do was just get more people using it because the people were the value um and uber same thing every additional driver on the road um makes the the vet the service more valuable to everybody because you get faster pick up times and faster pickup times means more people will take rides more people take rides means more dollars available for drivers which means more drivers on the road which means faster pickup times again right so like that's the law of increasing returns so so that's what you really want is what's called a positive flywheel so i care about that a lot because business is really hard anyways um but when you don't have that you're just always working harder and harder to get more whereas with those businesses you work extremely hard at the beginning to get it going but then momentum starts to be on your side and i like that um i and i used to be and i and i have to fight this you and i are or i don't know if you are but i would i you might be we're where i like to take shortcuts when i first start stuff or at least i like i'm used to just get going here yeah yeah like let me like because i was always really good i'm like i can blunt i can blunt i can i can force you know brute force this uh people always just say like um well you know if you want to chop down a tree you should spend most of your time sharpening your axe i'm like [ __ ] that give me a sledgehammer hammer i'm going to start banging and by the time you're done with your sharpening i'm going to knock it out i'll be halfway through yeah yeah i'm like just get out the way i'm going to use strength and just and just you know force a will and i'm going to get it done and that that actually is super effective a lot of times but it's incredibly harmful some of the time because i have taken shortcuts where i'm like man had i done in this this way and just slowed down and done it the right way i would have been i would have paid huge dividends eight months ten months 14 months later right i wish i would have done that and when i hear these stories um i definitely think like is definitely the right way you have to put faith that you are going to be happier two years from now than you are if you do this one way even though it sucks now yeah so the important thing is to recognize the companies that are businesses that don't have this advantage so let's take e-commerce e-commerce is actually quite easy to get going um right like you you you don't even have to have a product you can drop ship or you just start doing you know you can do a thousand dollars of ads and make two thousand dollars of revenue like great you're in the game it wasn't that hard to get started you didn't need a license you didn't need uh anything to get going maybe some initial inventory that's kind of like the biggest barrier um but ecommerce doesn't ever get this law of increasing returns uh i i don't think so at least or it's minimal at best which is that you know if you're at one million dollars in e-commerce sales getting to two million um you know you're gonna have to do more work you don't get less work over time so you have to keep manufacturing the product uh whatever you did last year you know doesn't really behoove you doesn't really benefit your your growth uh you keep having to spend money on advertising and marketing it doesn't get cheaper over time it gets more expensive the bigger you try to scale it and so those have you know sort of almost negative negative effects over time at the very minimum it's neutral and so um so yeah basically i'm just trying to describe kind of like a network effect or a flywheel style business where um how is it that when you um if you draw an arrow between all the different parts of your business i get customers they do x because of x y happens because of y i get more customers that's what you want the circle has to connect and if the circle connects it doesn't matter that if it's hard to get off the ground once you do it it's gonna like start spinning faster and faster and get more and more valuable over time that's how you get a long lasting company that's one way the other way the other thing i think about is the exact opposite what's something that super just super disposable yeah this arbitrage opportunity may not be around forever but it's here now and so when i look at opportunities i look at one of i try to go like on one end of the spectrum or the other when i'm being smart and then sometimes i'm not being smart and i go in the middle and i i hate my life after that and i actually think that it's important to acknowledge that there's room for that second one which is everyone says like or myself as well i'll look at something like that and i'll say oh this is like a get rich quick thing this is just some stupid meaningless arbitrage and the answer is yeah it is right exploit it it exists have we talked about b-roll we haven't talked about it before okay so b-roll is a website that is not very well known but it's useful in the e-commerce world so what is this so the one of the most effective forms of advertising is what's called um ugc user generated content uh why does this work well most people are advertising on platforms like uh facebook or instagram or you know snapchat pinterest places like that and what are you competing with you're not actually you're not competing with other advertisers you're competing against the feed you're competing against the scroll if somebody's gonna scroll right by your ad to the next piece of like entertaining content right because you're it's you're here trying to sell a product and the next person is trying to make the person laugh or click the like button and then keep scrolling so you know you're competing against a meme you're competing against an influencer you're completing against like you know some model in her bikini on instagram so how is your ad going to compete in that that environment well turns out the best way to compete is actually not not to stand out but to blend in to look like instagram content well how do you do that so what people started doing was they were paying started paying influencers how do i get the kardashians you know it's like that brand sugar bear hair they went and they paid the kardashians you know silly money to post a picture with themselves with the little blue gummy bear in their teeth in their mouth basically they're holding it they're like biting down on it and they took a picture doing that while holding the bottle of sugar bear hair right and so they go and you pay a lot of money for influencers to do things and influencers are kind of hard to deal with they're divas they have managers and um you know and this is uh b-roll dot io d-e-b-e-e-r-o-l-l dot io b-roll dot io and so what does b-roll do all right b-roll basically says hey let's give we will get you content that looks like a person on instagram just using your product it looks like someone just posting a review uh you know a video review where they say you know i bought this hat uh found this hat i really love it here's why uh you know i have this problem with the sun getting in my eyes so this hat is amazing for xyz reasons or they'll be like you guys i just got my package from blah blah in the mail i'm so excited to open it i've been waiting for weeks for this thing and it's like what is this uh who is this like you know who's this person what have they been waiting weeks for and then they open it up and they're like great here's this eye wrinkle cream and you know it's gonna be so good i'm gonna try it on blah blah then make this video out of it and so b-roll is basically a way to push a button and get a bunch of average looking people to create the content that fits your story that you want so you almost write a little script a little storyboard where you say first say that you got the package in the mail and you're so excited second open it up while you're in your bathroom and show your face in the mirror before third put the cream on then fourth uh you know do your makeup do your hair put improve the lighting and then show how much better you look now that you put our cream on and then say guys you gotta try it i want you you guys gotta if you guys follow me you guys gotta try this so how did how do they make money they take a cut so what they've done is they went and got all the like wannabe influencers of the world micro influencers this is like you know some mom in florida who wants to make 40 50 bucks for uh for making a video while she's at home like while her kid naps or it's like you know some girl in college who's in her dorm room and wants to make you know 100 this month to pay for whatever you know a manicure at a pedicure and what they get is they get your product for free and then maybe they get a little bit of cash and in return what you get is content for your ads that looks like real human beings making content because it is real human beings making content for you is it a big business it's a good business i don't know it's not a big business yet but i think this could be a big mistake it's sort of criminally under-marketed right me explaining this is probably the best marketing they've had right and ironically this is actually like a b-roll right like if they i know if they're gonna use this did you see uh there's an app called parcast i think something like that uh no it's not cool i forget what it is oh pinata and they're using your your voice and me like commenting as an ad i got i got i kind of got angry at them so uh what's what's this company's called beehive i talked to the guy who who owns it i actually would like to buy a business like this i think this is a really good this is a business that can make i don't know it can make a lot of money so here's what i relate this to there's um there's a business called user testing which we've talked about on here i like user testing user testing did the same thing they activated the stay-at-home mom workforce which is there's a whole bunch of people that are staying at home they want a little bit of side income they don't want to have like specific skills like you know some coding or designing or something like that and they just want to make a little bit of money they'll they're willing to basically trade half an hour or an hour of their time for 10 15 bucks and uh they have flexibility they do it when they want and they don't do it when they don't want it and so what user testing is is they basically matched up that mommy at home workforce with companies that wanted feedback on their website so go to my website try to do x y and z and record yourself while you do it and if you get confused i want to see that so i can go improve my design and user testing has become a very large company hundreds of millions in revenue and we'll go publix you know probably in the next 12 to 24 months is my guess and so user testing became a large company multi-billion dollar company doing that i think this activates the stay-at-home work workforce in a different way which is to say hey do a review or a testimony of my product that i can put on my website or in my marketing right um what what why wait for why pay i overpay for influencers or wait for customers to like take the time to do this i'll pay you i'll give you some free product i'll pay you a little chump change to create a testimonial or a review or create whatever you know a little little short video clip because that's the what i need to be advertising on tick tock or anywhere else great can i explain to you what i would do if i wanted to make money off this yeah i used to have like a little like ecom things and i would go to i hate admitting this because frankly i don't think it was a good idea but i would go to fiverr.com and i would write a script and i would pay someone five to a hundred dollars to record them as a testimonial really it wasn't even that good because they make it look too professional yeah yeah it was a testimonial nonetheless now i have no idea if this is what what's it called b-roll i have no idea if this is what they did but basically what they're doing is they're just taking a very specific niche of fiverr fiverr.com is like probably the leader in this space it's a publicly traded company it's um the whole shtick was five dollar things that you could do now uh like you can draw a logo or make a video a 30 second video and people would game it i use fiverr.com to get ten thousand twitter followers and it automatically looks like ten thousand twitter followers would make me look legit yada yada people use it for scams what i would do is i'm looking at fiverr's annual report and they'll actually tell you more likely than not what some of the fastest growing categories are and what the fastest and most popular services are or you could just go straight to fiverr.com and do like ranked by popularity and i would just rinse and repeat and i would look at what be role did and i would look at which category is the most popular and i would create a website just for that and i think you could probably build a pretty good business doing that we should we should do that we should go into we should do a dive into fiverr's um you know like public reports and let's see what we find because fiverr is a pretty interesting business we could do fiverr and uh maybe like upwork or whoever i'm gonna show you oh you can't see my screen huh like you could do you could do like like all right i'm just on fiverr.com like fiverr but only focusing on voiceovers so it's like for for five hundred dollars we'll read whatever you want for a 60-second thing and i sound like this voiceover i sound like a movie guy or you can get this other person uh who sounds like a commercial lady from a credit card commercial yada yada yada yada yeah or you could do you can do like i'm gonna send you a screenshot of the uh of the like the storyboard that i submitted um to to use this thing and uh i mean it's the design looks like a little bit crazy but uh but it is pretty cool you'll see like how this works and i think i think it makes it very real in your mind like um how how powerful this would be it's like uh so for example if you're an e-commerce store right now or an e-commerce owner which is oh there's a lot of these right shopify has exploded in popularity and you you book a photo you book a professional photographer you go to a studio and you you go look at all your favorite brands lululemon nike gap whoever right and you say we want to make commercials like them we want to have our photos like them that's the way this should work we want beautiful clean you know like perfect lighting cute models wearing our stuff smiling and holding hands and you go put that on facebook and then next to it you take out your iphone and you record your face and you're you're basically set you basically are holding up your product in shitty lighting in your bathroom and you go guys i just got this you know whatever lip gloss and um i don't know why i picked lip gloss like i i wouldn't even know the first thing about what to say sorry let's pick a different one guys just got this hair product for my men's long hair that i have um i don't know about you guys but i wake up in the morning it looks like this and then what i do is i just squeeze this on put this in my hair and bam i look fantastic and um you know whatever even less salesy than that it's just like guys it looks so good except for this little part here but i gotta work on that anyways you guys get the idea that ad will kick ass compared to the studio photographer official um high quality um uh you know professionally done have you even seen that the commercials on tv people are doing this now too yeah because they saw because before you do it measure tv well enough right tv was hard to measure you couldn't figure out what works and what doesn't now you throw both ads on facebook you throw a thousand ads on facebook and you'll see this one gets the most clicks this one gets the longest views this one results in highest number purchases so then they probably did that spent 100 million dollars on facebook and said this is the best way to communicate our product to our customers now hey tv guy roll this instead and then they're like are you sure this looks like [ __ ] it's like no no trust me this works and so this lifestyle type of content or user generated style of content works so well so then the question is you're basically feeding into facebook's ad engine so this looks like a small business right it even sounds like a small business b-roll who you know like b-e-e like a little bumble bee the website looks like [ __ ] um you know how much revenue do you think they make i think they're probably doing a couple million one or two million a year as my guess and uh i think that this could easily be you know nine-figure business why because you're taking a subset of the facebook ad engine right facebook people are spending billions and billions of dollars on facebook advertising if you have a way for them to create more ad creative that converts better at scale without hiring their own people and doing this stuff in-house people are going to take you up on that bargain but you'd have to like you know basically market yourself as well you'd have to go and figure out how to get them all to use you you know what would be kind of cool i'm just thinking about this is we talk about so many things that i would love to do i'm like oh this just seems exciting and a lot of people think that way we should do an episode one day or make a list of where we list out the type of headaches uh that each business comes with so i think the issue is that we make things sound easy and in some regard they are they're really simple but they have issues that everything has issues so like with media the issues is you have to deal with people personnel um because it's a your people make your stuff with e-comm you have to deal with uh like the shipping and logistics uh you have to what do you have to deal with cash flow issues um whatever which is the whole supply chain yeah supply chain stuff with b2b software you have to deal with enterprise sales yeah enterprise sales and you also have to deal with like it can feel like it is a little slow sometimes like it could be a slog um like there's issues for everything i would love to hear like what the headaches are for this and some of the other stuff that we talk about so like what are the issues with this um probably maybe people uh because you're dealing with something it's quality control so the biggest issue is i'm an advertiser you did all the hard work to convince me to start to try using b-roll to get some videos made i put up my brief well i kind of wrote it in kind of a shitty way because i don't know how to do this right i wrote my script my script kind of sucks it was unclear it was open-ended blah blah blah that goes to some again some some person in tennessee who's just doing this for fun on the weekends to make a little side cache they half read the thing they record the thing but there's like background noise you know behind them to the point where you can't hear what they're saying or they didn't follow the prompt the client really said start the video holding up our product and uh the person just didn't do that and um now the video's in the client expects to get the video they wanted the the video creator expects to um get paid and nobody's happy the client didn't like the video and the creator said i did the work what's up and you're in the middle and you're now having to figure out how am i gonna ensure quality so that my advertisers don't get fed up and leave um throughout this process this is the problem for user testing as well user testing has a whole fleet of humans and robotics to make sure that the tests that get submitted are gonna make the client happy and the client's not gonna say hey i wanna refund this this person didn't even follow our directions or you know they they didn't speak they just they just clicked they didn't even give their thoughts out loud right so like we can't i don't want to pay 15 bucks for this test i didn't get what i wanted and you still owe the guy 15 bucks because they did the work and if you if you don't pay either one they're gonna leave the platform if you don't give you the one what they want they leave the platform now you have a churn problem so quality assurance is the number one issue with a marketplace like this in addition to the normal headaches of going and getting people to you know join your platform of yeah i i just want like uh i want like a glass door for different business ideas like uh what what where's the downside because everything has it just tell me what the downside is what i got to deal with um do you want to do one more or no yeah let's do one more uh because i feel like i was long-winded and not that interesting today so i'm gonna try to make up for it all right uh let's do one um okay this is cool poly market have you seen poly market no tell me all right i'm gonna i'm gonna screenshot what um what i do on this thing so poly market is a betting network it's a place to bet on the future so you can bet on anything so so if you go back on your beliefs is the uh the name is it's called or the phrase is bet on your beliefs the the trademark so it's similar to any betting platform like oh i can go bet will the lakers win tonight are they going to lose right but you bet on different type of stuff so here's the top bets right now uh number one will dogecoin reach one dollar at any point before june 15 2021 will andrew yang win the democratic primary of new york city in 2021 and so let's take that andrew yang one by the way really quick do you own dogecoin you tweeted out that you owned it dude is that real yeah [ __ ] i mean like so it's a huge thing for you uh well okay so the part i didn't tweet out was that i took gains along the way so i bought uh i bought a million doge at three cents and uh so that would be you know i would have made i don't know like half a million to a million dollars or something like that if i just held the whole thing but i sold at eight i sold that 15 i sold at 30 i sold that so now i still have a slug of it left uh and i'm just letting that ride at uh it's at like 50 cents now or something like that yeah only tweet the good stuff sorry go ahead yeah okay so so um so anyways this so so you could bet on something so like there was there was a bet or there's a bet right now will new york city be fully reopened by july 1. and then there's a price on yeah it's all simple yes and no so if you just look at this site it'll show you that 60 grand has been bet on this bet and most people are betting no so out of 100 of people who bet 73 said no and 27 said yes and so when you go bet you get better odds like if i'm betting the yes side and only 27 people have said yes i get paid more if that ends up being correct if i'm if you take one of these other bets like oh you know we'll both like this one i bet this one which is will floyd mayweather beat logan paul in their boxing upcoming boxing match to me this is like a hundred percent probability that if the fight happens floyd mayweather is going to beat logan paul yeah but on here uh you know it's 94 you get 94 cents basically it's 94 think yes and there's six percent if you bet the other side if you bet logan paul's gonna win and so to me that's free money that's gonna happen in one month right and so i can make like a six percent return on my money this month just by putting it into that bet well no uh so i put in 10 grand and if he wins i make uh 10 161 no that's only a 1.6 well so the problem is so that's the thing it's uh there's slippage if you bet uh more so there's only been six thousand dollars bet into this bet so if you bet ten grand you would have moved the market right so put in a hundred dollars and you can see what your what your return is um and so for the bigger the more popular bets you can bet 10 grand and it's not going to move the market right the andrew yang one has 260 grand in so your 10k is not really going to move the prices that much that's interesting sorry i'm gonna bet on this floyd one by the way floyd's gonna just it won't get me close of course it's not even is that even a question to me anyway so there's a bunch of these things that are like this but i think this is really cool it's a really cool product it's a it's a predict people have been talking about these prediction markets and crypto for a while and this is a crypto based thing so that the problem is created this um but just like i don't know some group some team of people in the crypto world and so what they say is if you see at the bottom there's a disclaimer poly market is only for informational educational purposes we do not custody your money we do not take profits we don't host these bets themselves so what they say is there's a betting protocol bets get made on there and this is just a website displaying the bets and letting you like bet into those markets or bed into those bed into the protocol or not and so these bets are all made on the ethereum blockchain so you um like the whole bet is made there and then they have a system for validation so how do like who's gonna say if floyd mayweather beats uh logan paul well there's like details in there of how they're going to decide and then there's what's called trusted like there's trusted oracles or whatever yeah yeah yeah there's a group there's a decentralized group of people who will all submit their answer what happened yes or no and once there's a consensus like if there is consensus then the bet finishes it closes and if there wasn't consensus like you know uh whatever is new york city fully reopened by july 1 that's something to me where i'm curious i don't know how they're going to resolve that like fully open it says it needs bars restaurants blah blah blah blah but like what if there's some gray area i don't know how they resolve these bets in that case but i find it really fun to like i think if you look in this podcast by now you know i'm kind of a gambler i find this to be a fun uh way to gamble on things that you know you're betting are gonna happen and so i put 5k into this thing and i started betting on different bets and i'm having a blast and so i'm going to keep doing it i i i think this is going to be quite large um like i want to bet for the saturday saturday night live thing it said will elon musk mention dogecoin on saturday night live and uh yes was paying out at like 94 cents but i was like i'm pretty sure he's going to do it and so i bet yes and so i made i bet 250 bucks and i made 330 or something like that so i made like a profit of uh i don't know i forgot it was like 80 bucks or something like that on the bet dude this is badass um so how did you find this uh people learned crypto talk about this thing i've i've heard the name before i've been to it before but this was the first time i actually started betting on it like you on twitter they talk about it yeah i don't even know man i'm just like so knee-deep in the crypto world i don't even know when i hear about things maybe it's twitter maybe it's a friend i have no idea oh they just raised money yeah they've raised money they're they're kind of well they're like a well-considered brand i think um which is kind of weird because this thing like if you go to the website how it works and stuff is like pretty skimpy they don't really do like for a for a financial betting website you would expect them to have like way more like legalese and fine prints and everything and they really don't it's very like very bare bones uh but but yeah it's pretty cool it's like a las vegas betting system built on top of yeah this is direct ethereum right so if you wonder what's the value of something like ethereum is it just speculation like no people are building essentially casinos on top of ethereum right uh outside of the financial system it's pretty cool do you want to do for the next episode do you want to do the first segment on a how-to we can do because i i think i've got good research methods and i could explain mine but would you be interested in explaining do you have a particular way that you find because i mean i get anything that i a lot of stuff that i've invested in or that i invest time or just like curiosity into i learn from you do you want to share how you do that or is that not even a shareable thing well i have an idea of something i could share when you started talking but uh my brain started to think about that which is how to win inside a big company as an entrepreneur how to like make a mark inside a big company so i've done a couple things since joining twitch that i think allowed me to i just like didn't do the rat race and instead i made i did i just put a little effort into these like four or five other things that nobody else in the company does and because of that i got like an outsized reward i basically um [Music] like i made a name for myself in a good way you know by doing x y and z and so like if you're somebody who's in a big company and you're like well i'm just i'm just at this point i'm just another fish in the sea or you know i want to get promoted but i'm like i have to climb this ladder the way it's currently constructed my answer is no you don't uh there is a way to be like interesting inside a big company and do a few interesting things that will let you leave a larger footprint than just your job if you do it the way everybody else who has your same job title in your company will let you do and so i'd like to share some of those things the how-to how i made my mark inside a big company and uh i'd like to share that you know for others to do in their company so uh how to i don't know we're gonna call it how to succeed in a huge company as an entrepreneur how to um what i wanna do is like how how the how we do research and then maybe a third one that i want to learn from you is how do you manage this small team of people and because you have like a personal crew and like what do you pay them and what the cost and what's the roi and things like that that is something that i would love to learn from you yeah i'm down to do that one as well um and so yeah some people have asked me about that so yeah we can we can do that one i think more people want to know so i think people want to know that one and there's a lot of people who listen to this that have a job and um they're not like ready to go quit their job and start a company they don't want to tweet out you want to tweet out those three ideas and or i i can do it and we'll see what the people say yeah let's do it i think we should do all three just in one order we'll do we'll we'll do one each time it's okay uh june 3rd did i say i think i said june 3rd to you we're doing sean and i are doing a meetup uh well i guess it's trends and the hustle and shaun and i whoever's doing it we're gonna be there we're gonna host an interview uh i think with like we could do our thing in front of everyone and then also noah kagan will be there do you know noah i never met him in person just on the pod so he'll be there we're going to do it at his office so he's been kind enough to let us have his office uh so you can go to mfn mike my first million m f m pod dot com and enter your email and you'll get notified when that's being released like the uh we're going to talk about your town yeah when we come to you like you're working with austin yeah we're going to start with austin that's on june 3rd it's uh it's likely i'm almost positive it's completely free and we'll have room for small 50 people and then we haven't settled on this yet but not the day after but likely the day after we might go to miami um we haven't we got to lock that in if you have an office that could host 100 let's lock it in what are we waiting for let's lock it in it's done we haven't we haven't found the venue but the decision is done yeah like i'll i'll i'll plan to go but we don't have a place to be so we'll figure it out if you want to host us and basically if you want to provide light drinks and light food and you want to have 50 to 100 people tell us it's gonna be in the evening it's gonna be like a seven o'clock thing maybe 500 people mayor suarez if you are listening to this hey we've traded a couple dms hey you know i've been seeing you talking to my friends let's do this i think we could get 100 or 500 people i just don't know if i personally would want to would you want to like riff in front of 500 people oh yeah if i'm gonna do 100 why not 500 it doesn't make any difference to me well i don't even want to do 100 but let alone 500. uh but yeah whatever i'll go with the flow but we need a place so if you want to host us you can and i've got a couple other updates so we're going to talk we got sean actually did most of the research for this one we got a ton of cool ideas but do you want an update on some podcast stuff so you might be working with our team okay so uh in 3-1 so what was that march march we did 338 000 downloads in april we did 436 000 downloads so uh that's a 30 game about in may it's tracking towards around 520 000 which is another 20 20 increase i think we can keep going and i want to tell you what i think is is causing all this the first is the biology episode so guests typically we have found don't work that well but a really big name guest or someone that has a cult following like a tie or biology um that works who's ty lopez oh tai lopez okay gotcha uh when we did that one because he's like cult following and a cult unfollowing he's got both yeah yeah so that that worked so the biology's episode is probably gonna be the most listened one ever um so that worked out how much more is it than the usual is like 20 more 50 more than a typical episode it got to 30 000 like in the first week typically our episodes get to 30 000 over like two months gotcha okay so it it did that in like a week or whenever it was when did it get released a week days five days wednesday i talked to him on the phone and he said yeah a good episode i shared it so hopefully that helps and then uh he's down to share more but we only tweeted out i think one clip from it so he's down to share more clips and he liked the animation he was like oh like looks like production value's going up i was like sweet yes it is yeah uh so that worked out well and then do you want to announce what's working really well is how to's so any time a title is called how to build a paid community how to build paid events how to whatever we've done those rank the highest no matter what or not no matter what but more often than not so like in our top 10 most downloaded stuff it's either an interview with a huge a well-known person um which like an andrew would be a well-known person or a how-to blank so we have to do some more almost like they don't care about us and our great ideas they care about themselves learning something and being able to do something they want to do i think that's exactly what it is and then it's ourselves peppered in there we are the spice but the meat is the how-to right and then finally i got a last update um we're running some ads on do you know this thing called the billionaire investors podcast what's it called it's like a famous thing is it we study billionaires is it that one yeah i love that podcast if you're looking to do it yeah so we're running an ad on their net on their network on that podcast i think uh we bought it last week i think it's gonna go live this week then so there's two types of podcast advertising that i'm learning about the one is what we do is people advertise now hubspot advertises on our podcast and people go to hubspot.com mfm whatever the other one is podcast platform so like overcast have you heard of overcast yeah like these clients these apps you can use to listen to podcasts yes and on those clients those uh users click subscribe and the strategy that i'm doing is what we're doing is we are going towards niche ones because those niche ones typically have a far loyal following and you could get low cost per click to download and subscribe and it makes sense because those people if you are you got to be a real podcast junkie to go get like a new podcast app because it has these extra five features about podcasts so it's actually a really good audience that's probably really cheap because nobody else really goes for them so i i like the strategy a lot and they're like they're techie they're like tech they're early doctors yeah and so we're running ads currently on cast box i've never even heard of them but it looks cool and then overcast and so those are some of the updates uh it's going well okay what about the so the ad on the we study billionaires podcast what is it because i'm always like if i'm listening to a podcast what's actually going to make me go subscribe one is a guy comes on or a girl comes on and they're a guest like this happened with elaine elaine came on our podcast she did ideas and she said it was like i don't know one of her biggest uh her newsletter got like a huge spike in subscribers like her next email send was welcome all my new subscribers this is amazing and she said she got you know thousands of new subscribers from her appearance on the pod which is great and so that one makes sense because if i go and guest on somebody's podcast you listen to it for 45 minutes or an hour because that's your favorite podcast or that's what you listen to regularly and you might be like oh that guess was cool they said they have a pod i'll go check it out i like that method and i'm i've said it i got to do this i still have to go do it which is i want to go guest on as many podcasts as i can that would be part my contribution to this growth strategy but this ad is a little bit different it's just like a 30 second sound clip what are we saying in that 30 second sound clip that's going to make somebody want to subscribe unfortunately it's not a clip i think it's going to be stig the main guy reading but frankly i don't know we just closed the deal on friday okay fair enough uh so i have to figure it out but we have our guys so we we got this team uh henry and dylan they're making like a height like a sizzle reel right um and we might be able to use that but i don't know but i agree with you like in theory i agree with you i just don't know what's what's available at the moment and we're doing some other stuff to make it easier to follow so i'm emailing i've grown my email list and this year from zero to twenty six thousand subscribers now and at twenty six thousand i just sent it out the first time last week so just uh it's uh just seanpuri.com so if you go subscribe there you get all my emails but one of the weekly emails i send now is a podcast recap so if you don't have time or you listen to the pod while you're on the go i basically take the best three bits from that lat from the last uh the last week of episodes and i say this was the best idea this was kind of the second most interesting idea here was the third one and so sent that out for the first time and i think that will also make it easier for people to like follow along and if you were kind of on the fence or you were you're in and out you listen sometimes you don't listen other times i think that'll keep you on the hook because and then i copied your email like from sean and i sent it to like 30 000 hustle people who clicked on a my first million link in the past like two weeks and we're actually gonna increase that so it's like 100 000 people and my takeaway so far is it actually might be good for the user but shitty for our numbers because you just get the information without having to listen which kind of sucks that that like has to be the case yeah i thought about that but i don't think that's actually how the world works i think if you keep giving people value in every form that they want it short form text long form clips on twitter clips on youtube video on youtube podcast audio if you just keep giving people value they will learn that oh and whenever i want ideas whenever i want to feel that my wheels turning if i want to get that juice that energy um shawn and sam are the place to go to get it and our best raw the raw source the real deal [ __ ] is in the podcast and so i think over time those clips they just bring people who are on the fringes closer to the core i hope that's the case and i'm betting that's the case i'm putting my money on that but yeah yeah but it's a fear i and and i want to bring this back to one thing which is a lot of times we talk about this inside stuff and hopefully it's not like a circle jerk like oh we're awesome yada yada uh i'm revealing this because a lot of people people like this i like it when i hear other people say the numbers but also i want to point that i think we're doing really good but i actually don't think that we are good i think persistence is good and the reason why this is working is because persistence works quite well so we're actually on we're close to episode 200. we've been doing this for uh is it going to be two years two years two years maybe in september or august july something like that july and i would say that we miss i i get sick sometimes i miss stuff sean will miss stuff because he had a baby but we're pretty much always on and at worst we're mostly at least good uh like we're like it's typically always at least okay sometimes it sucks sometimes it's really good mostly it's okay and like sorry mostly it's good i would say but that consistency is actually really important and we're going to appsumo um and i guess now in three weeks and there's a great story that noah told me or and basically no kagan runs this company called appsumo um it's a it's a weekly email where you get deals on software this year they're going to do 100 million in gross revenue of which like 50 50 million is their revenue it's a great business it's 10 years old and he was like you know i realized something that this business that we're running it's done really well but it didn't do well at first but everyone wants to know like why is this doing so well and he goes i really just put in 40 hours a week but i just did it for 10 years and it has finally started to pay off and turn out and done really well and it's just like it's just a job and i just but i do it all the time and i treat it like a job and that has paid dividends and i think that more people who listen to us could kick ass a lot harder if they treated their side hustle like a job yeah i i would uh i agree with you persistence is great the one thing um that this reminds me of is i got some advice from the ceo of twitch emmett and um we so so when i got acquired uh when our team got acquired our company got acquired we were put on a special project inside twitch and it was kind of like one of the like uh most people at twitch are working on something that already exists hey this you know people already use us we're already the category leader you've got to make it better make it more profitable make it smoother make it whatever it's more like maintaining and improving an existing winner and we were put on this little we're on the edge of the island and we're the only team in the company basically or one or one of three teams that was working on something that where we weren't the winner wasn't proven and so we uh it was considered like a kind of a top priority so we did this thing uh every week the top my team would present to the ceo the ceo and the chief product officer we had an hour with them every week and in a big company you don't really get an hour with those three people every week that's like a very expensive meeting as they say and um because it was important and i used to go in and i would try to basically every i feel like every two weeks i was pulling a a rabbit out of my hat trying to be like and here's the new genius tactic that we're gonna do and this one is gonna be the one that works and like some of them did make an impact but emmett had this observation where he was like you know i feel like you um have a lot of good ideas and then every month we're we're like sort of like on a weekly or monthly basis when we sit here it's always like yeah it's good but it's not as good as we want it to be we're still like we're so small we want to be so huge um and he's like you're impatient with the results and so i so i change one thing at the top of every um every update that you have to bring in a memo at the top of every memo um i was the only person in the company that was doing this everybody else their memo goes straight into like here's the weekly update here's how it's going here's what here's what we're doing next at the top i wrote in bold impatience with action patience with results i said that's our team motto i'm putting it up here mostly for myself to remember impatience with action that's what impatience is good is when it's you're being impatient by taking action but impatience is bad when you're impatient about results so i'm putting at the top of this [ __ ] paper every week so we're all going to see it so that was cool then the second the second lesson came like six months later nine months later when he was like by the way you guys notice like we got the results like it's actually coming to fruition now and if we look back we can't say which one thing we did was like the big growth mover and he goes because there's this uh phrase that i think andreessen horowitz uses which is or they made it more popular i guess i don't know if they invented it but ben horowitz has it in his book which is there's no silver bullet there's only lead bullets and this is about this is basically what that means is there's no silver bullet strategy there's no one thing you're gonna go do that's just gonna magically like make everything okay make everything work um the only growth strategy that truly works over time is a many lead bullet strategy which means you fire you do a bunch of things and you keep firing keep firing keep firing until the you know the thing falls over and finally finally you break through and so i would say this is a good and so that became the second motto which is remember only lead bullets and so that that was those were the top of every weekly update was those two that's pretty good to catch myself because i'm good but my what's my leak my leak was impatience my leak was looking for the genius tactics when all it took was lead bullets and patience and uh and so you know if you take away one thing you know us talking about our growth numbers i think some people will like it because they like hearing the actual numbers it's great when somebody's like transparent about things cool we're at over half a million downloads this month like monthly now and we're trying to get to a million some people will be like why do they talk about their podcast number so much but i hope the takeaway is forget about how our podcast is growing that's probably irrelevant to you but you probably have a project you're trying to grow and hearing how sam thinks and talks about how he's growing this podcast is gonna be beneficial for how you do it okay how to grow a thing uh yeah back to our how to's i think that um and we'll move on but the last the phrase that i've been thinking about a lot lately is people overestimate what they can accomplish in a year but they underestimate what they can accomplish in 10 years and decades right absolutely and and that's kind of an example here like we've been frustrated on some month-to-month basis or a week-to-week basis but like it's kind of cool seeing these numbers uh like really start pale i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back

Shaan and Furqan host a weekly "Cool Sh!t Hour" between themselves to discuss the coolest innovations Furqan's seeing. We basically took that and made it into a podcast. Furqan talks about mind-control hardware, vertical farming, and a lot of interesting crypto projects. He also talks about what it was like starting a multibillion-dollar company and his mindset around making decisions on what projects to work on.

anyway i got one more in a different space that i think sam will love sean i told you about this book i read about vertical farming and uh you know basically like i read that wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute you guys just were talking about crypto stuff and then he just said i've got something i think sam will like farming yeah that big of a ready to you i like it too i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want all right we have a special guest on the pod today fur khan is here he's my old co-founder uh probably the smartest guy i know uh especially tech wise so we talked about a bunch of things ranging from his last company applovin which just went public at a 20 30 billion dollar valuation so we talked about you know the humble beginnings of that and all the way to a massive ipo uh what he's doing with his money you know so you win the lottery what are you gonna do and he talks about his new project that he's building out and then we talked about a bunch of cool things that he um he shows me so every every week we do i do a call with him called the cool [ __ ] hour where i just sit there on video and i just say hey show me cool [ __ ] that you're interested in because he's like a total uh you know tech nut he's on the bleeding edge of everything and so that's my hack to learn a bunch of things before they go mainstream and um so he talks about you know some hardware stuff that he's really interested in like a brain wave measuring device that he's wearing he talks about crypto uh and then we talk about vertical farming and the future of that so a bunch of cool topics on that side i would say there's some part of the crypto stuff that might be over your head so too many terms acronym stuff you don't know about here's my advice uh two ways you could still get value even if you don't fully get it because hey i only half get it uh for con is usually 10 steps ahead of me and so what i've learned in knowing fergon for like almost a decade now is when he thinks something's interesting instead of just saying i don't understand that that's weird uh lean in go google it later look it up uh you know if i had just followed a bunch of the things he was interested in interested in i would have made a killing investment wise over the last decade and i've learned the hard way that that's what i should do the second thing is uh he shared a bunch of general advice about how he went about his career you know college dropout um choosing jobs that weren't the highest paying job and why he chose it what he kind of optimizes for i thought there was some good stuff in there so if you are not subscribed to this podcast if you're just listening to this podcast maybe your friend told you about it you know what you need to do open up the podcast app apple uh the itunes app or open up uh spotify on spotify you click follow on the apple podcast app you're going to click subscribe we are climbing the charts i think we're number 12 in maybe business or investing category and we're breaking into that top 10 and we're not leaving when we get there so how do we do that subscribe if you've enjoyed this podcast you get value out of it just hit the button that's all you got to do hit the button thank you so shawn and i are both wearing harvard shirts i actually planned this i saw you a screenshot of you testing and i went and grabbed my harvard shirt i was about to go on this big like what a coincidence this is amazing no i i do have one that i wear um but i saw you were wearing it so i wanted to uh i wanted to wear the same thing because we normally wear black t-shirts yeah and you know for the record neither of us went to harvard uh but we both do this thing where we'll wear harvard stuff and then people be like oh harvard and then you respond you're like miss that campus love it love it and you went on a tour and they actually went to harvard yeah yeah yeah yeah they're like oh you're wet like yeah yeah yeah i got a groupon it was lovely they showed me around oh four oh yeah we almost overlapped it's like i don't know i was just there for lunch but uh yeah oh like were you there at noon con's even better ferguson didn't even finish college so forgot his of all of us he's the most he's the smartest most successful one and he was smart enough to drop out after what freshman year sophomore year uh i was there for a couple of years uh i mean i tried to do i went to san jose state i tried to do computer engineering because obviously that would have made sense but i was running a company at the time and every time i was deciding between electrical physics or on the phone with somebody trying to make a deal and you know you know which one won so yeah do you want to give a background sean of fur khan because uh last time he was on we were way smaller yeah uh fur khan is one of my best buddies he was the guy i started my last company with or was co-founder cto so you know most co-founder pairings i would say the most common one is one guy who can build and one guy who can sell and that's kind of what we were like i'm more like the sales guy and he's more the building guy and uh so yeah we worked together ahead of six seven years sold the company uh a year and a half ago for kind of braved it out and made it one full year at a big corporation so i gotta give him props for that that's like a you know an endurance challenge for you um but now now he's now he's doing his own thing so he's got f.inc which is how do you describe it uh it's uh i just want to build cool things with cool people so that's what i'm focused on that's really it i would describe it as you know if you're trying to start something you want like a third co-founder it's an interesting emerging tech idea uh that's where i get excited and i want to put in time and money and incubate these things with you all right i'll give a different description i'll give my my view of it sweet basically uh fercon is investing in himself like 15 years ago whoever is that person so if you're like a young engineer and you want to make some [ __ ] happen and uh man it'd be kind of helpful if you had somebody who's been around the block who's done it before who can either give you money advice build actually get in the code and build with you and so he's got this disc it's kind of like y combinators you've got this discord group and every single company is like i don't know like a 23 year old engineer they get their own channel and then basically on some of them furcon's actually like the back end engineer with them on some of them he's like the tough love investor who's like dude why aren't you focused on growth why are you talking about all this other [ __ ] and in some cases it's like uh oh you need to move to san francisco and like live on my couch i think you've done that with a few engineers of like literally come here sleep on my couch and i'll like not just seed fund you i'll like [ __ ] babysit you and incubate you literally and physically in my apartment i want to spend some time actually discussing that because i want i want to like reminisce a little bit but but first by the way we got to congratulate furcon also his he since he's come on his last company uh applovin ipo'd um i don't know what what is it at now ipod close to 30 billion dollars so you know yeah i was gonna say we have to give that part of the story which is fur khan co-founded the company that is currently publicly traded for 20 billion dollars yeah rich is what i'm trying to say so that's like pretty important although it looks like you guys did you guys just do an earning so something happened today where your stock just plummeted well not plummeted but it went down uh a fair bit uh yeah i don't know i mean all tech stocks are getting ravaged right now um yeah but you know yeah so congratulations like basically that company you guys are supposed to sell it for also like a huge amount like three billion or something like a couple years ago in it and it failed and then it turned out to be a blessing in disguise it seems well you should you should explain that that's a good story so we're working together and fur crown's like dude like i got some good news and he's like you know my last company we're going to sell for we're going to sell uh they're going to sell it and i think it's i don't know what it was 1.4 billion or something like that right that's what the original sale price was yeah i think they put a 1.4 billion value i think the terms were something like they're going to put in a billion dollars and the value would be at 1.4 they're going to buy a majority of the company uh most of the early employees would have gotten liquidated unless you're working there you would have gotten kind of whatever new grants right which would have been an amazing outcome anyways right oh wow you built a company 1.4 billion that's you know that's a win that's a grand slam but then something happened what happened and how did that work out in your favor yeah so the company was an international company it's a chinese company and 2016 the elections happened and you know politics kind of changed a little bit and i think in that process like it started looking like man this is like not gonna go through like they're not gonna be able to get approval in the u.s for a foreign entity to kind of buy this thing and uh so that happened and then there's some time you know in every contract when a sale happens there's like all these triggers right like hey you gotta complete by so and so date if it doesn't happen then you know whatever the contract might end and i think in that time i mean i wasn't at apple and i was working with you but you know every time i talk to somebody there they were like dude we're still crushing it we're growing and it's still kind of scaling up and so it looked like the deal was not going to happen the company had like multiplied in value during that time and so now there's like all this leverage on the company side to be like well we don't actually need this sale right like we're a lot bigger than what that value was and i think they turned it into an investment instead with like non-voting or you know some some kind of distinction there and we ended up getting some liquidity then which was fantastic it was like over a billion dollars like felt great i felt like that was the exit uh felt like that changed you know kind of what i could do in my life in terms of where i spend my time um but then they just kept growing the company kept building and they continued down the path they partnered with kkr and you know brought on i think harold is on you know kind of the executive team now and he's a seasoned vet in the industry and they just continue just to kind of you know skyrocket and uh i don't know to dumb it down app loving is basically uh like they you guys helped invent advertisements that you see in the middle of iphone games correct yeah so we started as an ad tech platform that's when i was there and uh you know then after that they brought up you know kind of a the gaming side so they have a gaming studio which generates a lot of revenue uh if you think of them as like almost like a first party game creator now that's where i think the company's gone they bought machine zone right so they acquired a bunch of studios they have their own studio so they're almost more a gaming company than a mobile ad network now so that's kind of crazy but the funny part is i remember you telling me like oh you know we kind of did this sale then a piece of paper is going to go sit on someone's desk trump comes into office and now you know i think was a chinese company a chinese company's buying this anything that's over a billion dollars i believe there's some rule that it has to get like you know a certain type of approval for the transaction to go through and then it just sat there for like i don't know how many months six months nine months something like that and then when they came out of that he's like yeah by the way like we kind of get the best of both worlds they made you know their buyout turned into a minority investment so we still got the money but we get this free roll of great how big can we build this and then fast forward a few years and it goes public uh at like we just kind of 20 times the value you know we just kind of skipped over something pretty amazing which is he kind of was casual about it you guys both were basically you built this ad network that was doing wonderfully huge company and like i i i'm gonna say it in the same way but basically you saw which games are doing cool and you go we're just gonna make games kind of like that and make them popular because we already know what's popular before even the people making the games know what's popular and now you make all your revenue from making games that's pretty astounding right yeah i mean um i saw all of this from the outside but like there are some key players in the company that i think were really instrumental in this there was this guy rafi he like when when i you know when we kind of created apple and we were working on the products before applovin uh this guy was just like somebody adam knew he knew his brother he had worked with them before he was like this 19 year old guy he's not going to go to college he's you know all he wants to do is like do something big and play video games so like he'd spend all day all night playing street fighter but then he would talk to every single kind of japanese mobile gaming company all night and he would just grind and it was an awesome environment i mean i'm kind of like the person where like if i get really excited about something that's all i want to do that's what i was doing at the time so i'm at the office rafi's at the office you know we spend all night i'm hearing his conversations i get pumped up about it and then kind of during the day we're building all these things and you just saw people everywhere in the company that wanted to do something big and went and got it so raphael i think at some point in this ad network was like i want to build games they had built this thing called lion studios within applovin i don't think it was very big at the start like it was kind of like some small games but narafiya i think he probably gets a lot of the credit to like kind of spearheading that and like just wanting to do it and you know when i looked at the s1 and kind of like dug into it it's like i think it's like half the business now you know there's obviously details on how you determine where the business is but i think it's like half the company which is incredible right like started with this ad network and then you know in two to three years kind of towards the end of this one public era you now have kind of built up the second part of the business is also math and you and the guy who started applovin i mean it was a few of you guys but like the main guy his name is adam right yeah adam and basically he had like a i don't know if it was mild or or very successful outcome at another thing and didn't you say that he put in like four million dollars of his own money which i don't know if that was a lot or a little to him but uh a pretty substantial amount of his own money and you guys kind of like [ __ ] around for like two years like point like you would say that like well let's try this and it didn't work and you're like let's just go play video games and think about it like like wasn't there like something like that we're like oh we'll figure it out yeah i mean adam john and andrew were like the three co-founders that like they had worked together before they had some done a couple of other companies that did well i mean john is like nobody knows john but john is like he worked on the first ad server on the internet i believe that got picked up by doubleclick and you know kind of that went on to google and then he worked at like vmware he had done all these different roles he's like technical but then very marketing focus very product focused and uh you know so it's like he was just an interesting person to have in the mix and then adam is like he had already kind of you know he started i think in equities trading in the chicago stock exchange and then gotten into you know ads and marketing and then they had built a company i believe it was called ah and i can't remember they said game fly or you know some something like that and it was like probably a really good outcome but then not where you know it wasn't like a massive outcome where he's like oh i can retire forever and i can you know like this is all i want to do and i've kind of made it and in the first couple conversations with him i remember walking down university avenue with him and he was just like you know i want to make something so big that i can walk down this street and people would know me and it's like university avenue in palo alto for people to know you must have done something like really big right it's like every who's who in tech walks down there and i was like okay okay i want to kind of like take a really big shot but the m3 put in the initial funding i think it was like around four or five million bucks if i remember correctly but it was a lot in the sense that it gave us many years of runway to work on whatever we started with one project called style page we did that for like nine months that was kind of like pinterest we really quickly realized we're like you know five dudes in like palo alto with no fashion sense trying to build a fashion website this is not going to work very well yeah like you know just wranglerjeans.com it's that easy that's your website where you're going to stop you know you don't need a pinterest board to find lee jeans yeah exactly and uh and then we messed around with a lot of different ideas and some of them weren't very good and i think sean we dealt with this a lot right like you get excited about something because you have to come up with an idea you make it you're not really that confident with it before you even launch you're like this is trash i don't i don't even want this anymore to get it away from me so there was definitely some of that yeah but you you i think one of the things worth mentioning is that you which i think it's worth mentioning because i remember every time i built a company i'm always like well this is just how i'm doing it it's probably real wrong but like i don't know the smart people probably do it this other way and i remember you talk i remember feeling very comforted when you told me like yeah that love when we went through nine ideas you know is it this is it that is it this is that and like you know some false hopes of like uh kind of works uh no it's not gonna work out and then in between you're like yeah there were some days we just came to the office we didn't have the idea to work on and so we just played fifa for a bunch of hours and we would go eat talk come back play some more fifa then we would go home like there were days like weeks like that and i remember thinking all right that's probably not the like the method you should choose but like it reminded me that like success is not so glamorous like you know they show in the movies where it's like oh i have the idea i'm a visionary i got it right away from day one and then we work hard and we just a b c d e it's done you know and so uh i don't know is that a fair representation of what you what you experience yeah it's definitely non-linear i mean you can work really really hard for a long time and feel like you've made zero progress and you could be doing all the right stuff you could be making the right calls and the other challenges you don't know like you don't get feedback right away on the things you're doing or are good i mean you get customer feedback but you don't get this kind of meta feedback that like the general type of things i'm working on are going to kind of work and hit and uh i mean style page was kind of one idea that we really dug ourselves into that everything between style page and then app love in the ad network was just like you know it's just like kind of really small projects that you're not super confident about you're trying to find some edge you're trying to learn something and you know mobile was just getting big android was getting big there's some opportunities there but you just don't know you know it's like how vr is today you're like i believe this is going to be a lot bigger in the future what is exactly what people are going to do it's really hard to predict and when you tell somebody they usually go nobody's going to do that well if nobody can predict these behaviors how do we build them you have to have this kind of like blind conviction towards something and also like get that right so it's like yeah it's really hard yeah you definitely need some luck you got to pick the right thing this guy adam how do you sell how do you say adam's last name furugi so farooqi adam ferugi he's the ceo now and from what i've read about him i don't know him he seems like a wonderful ceo like the glass door reviews are great he wins all these awards he seems like a lovely guy i've seen interviews with him and then but what you're describing is like a bunch of really like relaxed calm people just like i'm kind of dismissing it but not really like you guys are just kind of messing around and like uh trying to help yeah which isn't of course that's not the reality but how did this guy go from being this like kind of relaxed calm dude just trying to hang out and find a hit to leading a 20 billion publicly traded company i mean when i look at him he looks pretty polished he looks like a good good guy that's like a pretty amazing transformation yeah and so i i think relax is probably the wrong the wrong word i mean we were intense when we played fifa it was like i'm gonna beat you eight times in a row it wasn't a casual game of fisa fifa so everything was competitive and we would play mobile games competitively that was a lot of our interest app oven when we started was actually an app where you could see what games and apps other people were playing in your social network it was like kind of like a feat of act that was a first iteration of app loving and it was because we just wanted to see what people were playing because we wanted to kind of get those games and be competitive within it so he's always been competitive i think you really uh see that in him and but you know i used to say like like fur crown's work schedule is like roll into the office at 11 lunch with the crew catch up on what people are up to just starts getting humming around you know does a couple meetings starts getting hung around three four and then basically like by like 8 p.m to 3 a.m is when ferkan does his work and then he repeats it the next day and so for i remember in our company there was a bunch of people who were just you know regular human beings that would work in a nine to five and then they would go turn off their brain and go home and like for some of them it was really hard to have a boss and kind of like a leader who's on a completely alternate schedule some people were totally fine with it they made it work and then we recruited a bunch of like raffy type dudes who were like oh cool we stayed up until 3am here like great that's my optimal schedule too like i'm down with that and so but at app 11 you had told me that adam was the opposite he was coming at nine leave at four or five whatever he's got like five kids i think and like every minute was efficient whereas i gotta say like the way you work it's not that every minute is like boom boom boom i'm doing this this this like even at our company we would take video game breaks every day at 4 pm and go play super smash bros for an hour right like you had very opposite styles but you guys made it work yeah i think adam is like make every minute count and you see that uh and how he like operates and that's why he's the ceo of a 20 billion dollar company is because everything happens very fast very efficiently uh like when a decision is made the whole company knows about it when movement's happening it's immediate it's like make decisions fast be strong with your kind of movements you know outside of it follow through with it quickly like those are qualities i think are really really critical in a ceo i mean for me it's like i want to make obviously every day count like i work a lot when i'm excited about something and the apple open times was that when something's growing i take it seriously but you know i know that creative work is like it happens in kind of these moments of flow if you get two or three good flow states a week i feel like you produce a lot and i think most developers or creative people or builders don't feel this like not every hour is super efficient but there's there's some times where maybe it's because you did all this stuff to build up to it or you got the right conditions but you hit like three or four of those a week man you're you're really you know humming you're producing a lot and a lot of impacts happening and so i always focus on impact and you know i think it was a good pairing because i would just work super hard to go and tackle the next like technology barrier with my team and then the next morning adam would just drive a bunch of traffic by the time i rolled in at noon it was like we knew the test worked or not and you know that was like awesome just to feel the first time i've ever felt somebody like take control of growth and like literally say actually we're gonna get this answer today and obviously if you have like you know a good bank account and you can kind of fund it you can spend money to make your answers happen faster we got a lot of cycles in in those you know times we were building these crap apps we didn't waste like a year building some garbage app because very quickly we knew it wasn't gonna work and why and we tried all the variants of it and we got we had like confidence that we were done with that idea like oh we tried it it's not gonna work we're not gonna be lingering about this you know so let's switch to ideas so me and you do a call every week um it's one hour and it's called the cool [ __ ] hour and every time i do it i'm like damn i wish i'd recorded that for myself but also people would love this and so i i want to do that basically you guys do this every week yeah we've sometimes missed some weeks but you know i had a kid and stuff like that but we've been doing it uh pretty regularly for a couple ever since he left uh you know twitch i was like well i still want to hang out and keep in touch that's like the best part of when we used to work together was just shooting the [ __ ] about stuff that's cool and because fergan in his own words he told me this once was like i'm kind of in the first 10 000 people to try any new technology and like really dive deep and understand it because he does that he just sees a bunch of cool [ __ ] before the mainstream does and so my hack is well i'm never going to be as smart as this guy i'm never going to understand technology i'm not going to learn how to code but i can be friends with him and he could like explain it to me like i'm a kindergartner like uh i'm really into this right now check this out watch watch this demo here try this out here open up this website watch this and so we do that and the the thing with most of my relationships including this podcast i'm talking at least 50 plus percent of the time because i'm a talker when i do the cool [ __ ] out with a fur god i'm like i just sit back into my desk and i like take notes as like oh this is cool and i only stopped to ask clarifying questions of like wait how does that work so i want to jump into some of those things so we'll keep it open-ended i have a few that i know you're interested in i can guide us there but let's start with open-ended which is what are some things that are just cool or interesting to you it doesn't have to be like something you're working on necessarily but where is furcon's attention right now what stuff has caught your eye yeah i would say um there's probably three major things one is uh in the hardware space there's just there's just this trend that i feel like i can't get out of my mind which is you know commodity hardware whether it's like a raspberry pi kind of a simple device like that or off-the-shelf gears and things like that plus software like machine learning equals very advanced piece of hardware same raspberry pi yeah well i i don't know what the application is but it's basically like a fifty dollar i don't i don't remember how much it costs now yeah it's like a thirty computer it's like a little board and it's important because now in a developer previously they would have had to design their own little small computer board to go build a small like you know if you wanted to build a roomba you'd have to go design a little computer to put in the roomba then design the roomba now you can kind of go pick up this like computer that's just a little board and you can put it into anything like you know it took half your company away of what you needed to do to make this happen who makes raspberry uh it's a company called adafruit i believe um but they're they're like an independent company they're like probably one of the biggest obvious maker space companies around um because they've you know i think they've sold like i want to say like 100 million of these devices now and so they're just crushing it they're just as well so what's what's an example of something that you or somebody has built with a raspberry pi just so people have a tangible example so like uh there's another device of this from nvidia i'm using the nvidia jetson it's like a little version of a gpu but i basically have a little gpu plugged into my tv it has a webcam on it and you know we messed around with some like pose estimation so like you know you can open my tv and you can basically stand there and a little ball will come and if you hit that ball like it'll go blue or you made like a connect like an xbox kinect you just made like a bootleg version of it and then we kind of did some hand gestures where if you you know we basically i think that this this and then this that's kind of like the three gestures and we can kind of read that on the other side and so and he basically just put up like you put up like a one or two or three basically right yeah and this was for me like you know i like to go and mess around with it my idea if i wanted to do this as an idea i would do like uh the best fitness product would be you buy this little device it plugs into your tv because everybody has a tv on their wall now your tv is this awesome fitness game uh and you could just do like everything i think i wanted to call it like fit cam or you know something like that but uh instead of like that company that sold to lululemon for like 500 600 million yeah exactly two thousand dollars right here for thousands of dollars that you have to mount onto your wall well you already have a screen on your wall called your tv what if you could just turn it into something smart that's one of the like for thirty dollars instead of three thousand dollars dude i have uh i have like a mere competitor called tempo i pay 50 bucks a month for the programming and then two grand for the machine oh yeah and it's basically a flat screen tv with uh they don't call it a camera because they don't want to freak people out because like you work out like i work out shirtless in my underwear basically so they don't call it a camera but they call it a sensor and it could like tell you if your are your poses in good form or not good form and uh it counts your pose it counts your reps so you can compete pretty cool yeah and so that's one i'm going to tell you about this other company i invested in them but i i just really really excited about it so i'm going to tell you guys this company called neurosci they make a brain computer interface so this sounds like future but it's now it's basically a device and i actually wish i had it next to me but you just put it on your head you can go ahead if you want i want i want to see if it's within the room it's not going in the room you know how you know how on talk shows like uh morning shows they have a guest come in and they're like here's the latest products that you can buy for your kids this holiday season and they're at a table and they go this product is this is this and they set it down they go to the next one that's what fur con is right now basically it's that segment where someone is just like has placed like eight cool things on the table and they're just going from thing to thing to thing just dropping bombs and i'm like oh great cool got it next you know what i mean that's what's going on right this is uh fvc this is fur khan's qvc competitor where he just picks up objects and like this is a fantastic holiday gift for the family yeah and so this is for you know kind of like developers and whatnot still but this is what the device looks like and i'll kind of give you guys a closer look but you can see these little uh probe looking things so this would basically kind of rest on your head like that and what this does is it listens to eeg waves happening in your brain and i think there's many different wavelengths but you know these guys have identified some set of them and so why why does this kind of relate to the story we're talking about there's a little computer that's inside here that you know like wouldn't have been able to happen 10 years ago and so because you could put a little computer here that has wi-fi on it that can take these signals in and transmit it to the internet this device is viable now and you can so so you you wear that and it helps measure your like what focus or your kind of are you in flow state it's kind of like a fitbit in some way for your brain or what so the device itself first takes in raw signals so it can detect a lot of stuff they've added some machine learning right so the second part they added software and they pre-programmed all these different actions so there's some stuff like are you focused right now are you calm right now uh kind of things like that are you gonna enter a sleeping state they can detect all of these conditions but there's other things that i'm really excited about uh where it can detect uh if you think about like pinching your left hand like if you think about doing this actually but don't do it it can pick up that signal or if you think about moving your hand your right arm it could pick up that signal specifically and so you know you could think of this as both a receive state and detect things but also as an interface to kind of you know without having to move a muscle just thinking about a muscle change change the channel without going and picking up the remote so the guy who made this is like 17 right for 18. um i i don't know his age i think he's a little bit older than that but yeah you know there's this guy alex i believe he has a neuroscience background and the ceo is this guy aj um and you know what's funny is i bought this device as a person right like i'm just like i bought this device i think i was probably in the first 100 or 200 to buy it um and then i was like i sent them a message i'm like i love this i'm like an investor like can i talk to you guys and i don't think they responded to me and then um then i joined they had they sent a message like hey do you want to schedule like uh like customer call like they were doing customer discovery now my sweet so i like joined this customer discovery called do the whole thing but then at the end i'm like dude i really love this like this is me there's a bunch of stuff about me not some rando but like i'm like really excited about this like i want to invest like and then he was like still kind of like okay like kind of like aggressive in the customer call to kind of get this but then we followed up after i talked to him and ended up investing a little bit of money into them but i love these devices i love these things where it's like small piece of commodity hardware plus advanced machine learning equals potentially massive new output right like you know and i can go into some random ideas on how i would use this but also this is called we got to make sure we let everyone know it's called neurocity so their website is neurocity.com their website is so awesome when i'm on this it okay so it's basically what this kind of looks like it basically looks like a set of headphones but you don't put it on your ear you put it up on your head a little bit it costs i think 900 and they claim that they manage your focus with music and then you minimize distractions and shifts your focus and hacks your flow this is a brilliant website i almost would buy this just because like it looks so mysterious is the right one maybe i mean it's definitely something new and early and you know when people say like hey we're gonna manage your flow state you always you know what do we all do we kind of call [ __ ] on it right you're like wait like are you gonna do that how are you gonna hack my body right and so uh you get a lot of snake oil in the world there but this device uh it can for sure detect when i'm focused it can detect when i'm calm and different uh points and i've programmed it to basically like when i have it connected to my computer i can move my desktop around or you know i basically wanted to like see can i open brave from right like and open an application by thinking about something and i can do that that's miraculous to me like that's things you like read about in a book somewhere and then it was in the jetsons maybe but it doesn't it didn't really exist can you really do that so you can think to yourself like move the cursor and it works do you think move it do you think open chrome what do you actually think of to get it to happen yeah so basically uh i programmed it to these kind of thinking of motor functions so they have these pre-programmed like 40 or 80 motor functions like push pull move your right arm move your left arm move your index finger like and you don't move it you just think about that and then you do a little training step so like it just tells you think about moving your index finger and then stop thinking about it and so it does like a little machine learning loop like 20 iterations or whatever and then you know again this is a developer device still but i can get it to run some arbitrary code when i think about my index exactly dude i'm so excited to give this to my dog or to like an eight dog go to sleep well we used to make fun of craig clements came on here and he's like best idea he had three ideas at the end and his best idea was dog vr and we were like that's the stupidest idea but this is actually better uh because this would be like a way to communicate with a dog uh if you could get the dog to train it but i don't know that seems a little difficult um all right freaking so that was the first one which is cheap commodity hardware that now lets a software programmer like make hardware without having to have a lab and you know physical material engineering making motherboards and do all that stuff all right that's one one trend what are some others so the second trend i mean we're all into this but obviously the d5 crypto world there's just a lot of fun activity happening there and i've just you know it's one of those things where you just see it happening and you want to be a part of it and you read about it and you're building stuff but you know i was working with you and then i was working at twitch i hadn't really built anything in this space and so you know just recently i would say the last six months i've just been writing you know solidity code trying to think about what kind of applications to build what's interesting and my entire view of everything is there's these massive hype cycles then these hype cycles go away which is obviously what happens right when kind of this massive hype happens then there's a stopping point there where the real building begins and the real value would be created and all of these kind of industries flow like that vr crypto uh these kind of hardware spaces machine learning back in the day and so that's where we are in the decentralized and crypto world right now and all i want to do is build very valuable legitimate products that serve a real purpose and kind of go from there and you know so let's talk about crypto real quick so you uh you can apologize now for not including me in the ether crowd sale which i know you were on top of at the time did you buy in the actual crowdsource right after i bought a little bit after the crowd sale but it was like single-digit dollars it was very cheap i'm i'm pretty sure i said it out loud at lunch ever you know you did i remember you saying that and i was like i remember thinking ethereum dumb name uh like that's that's like a weird name normal people aren't going to want to own ethereum like that seems weird literally that was my my my dumb ass thinking and then like every you know year since then i sort of think about why don't i just listen to more deferracon why don't i just do the things he says to stop thinking for myself a little bit so so that's kind of where i'm at so you you initially bought some crypto i remember sitting next to you while you were buying you know random ass you know good good stuff and then the [ __ ] coins also just [ __ ] around seeing what's what and then you sort of showed me what's going on at d5 so if people don't know here's how i'll explain d5 and then you tell me what you would say so today there's like the normal financial system there's a stock market there's banks you can go drive and park and walk into when you walk into that bank you can say hey uh here's my money store it safely for me like put it in a savings account give me some interest maybe um or i'd like to take a loan out and then they say great let's just decide if you are credit worthy if you can get a loan and how much you can get so that's the traditional financial system like in a nutshell the simplified version there's a parallel like you know a parallel universe where all those same things have been built through code now instead of by law right so we used to write down you know contracts and put them in you know lawyers would write the contracts and now programmers write the contracts and so you could do all those same things so you've showed me tools and had me got me set up where you take your crypto money and you can put it in a savings account and you can earn five percent 10 a year of yield so you earn much better interest rates you can lend it to other people or you can take loans and get loans for things um so explain kind of like maybe what part is most interesting to you or give an example of something you've done with crypto where you're actually not just like speculating in the in the defy space but you're actually using this alternate financial system and so what's an example what what you were just saying what's like your favorite platform for that so furcon showed me a couple that i like so um you know so one is compound right so it's compound dot finance is a website you go to and what it says is hey great you have ether you don't want to sell your ether but so i did a very simple loan um i went to compound finance i staked or basically like i put up ether that i own i said great here's let's say 100 ether and then it says great you can you can just lend that out to other people who want to borrow ether and you can earn this percent annually and you know if you go to if i go to wells fargo i'm going to go get 0.001 you know a year on my savings account whereas with this it was like you can get seven percent a year or five percent a year it's like you know actually like a decent saving a decent interest rate or i could say great i put my 100 ether up and i'd like to borrow some of this other coin so what i did just as a test of the system i said can i get a loan off my cryptocurrency so i put up ether to borrow usdc which is a a stable coin made by coinbase which basically is supposed to be one usdc is supposed to always be one dollar so i got usdc and then i went to coinbase and i sold my usdc and i got dollars and i said wow i i just put up i just like basically showed that i have this ether and i locked up ether into this account for temporarily as long as i want and i got a us dollar loan that i could go use to go buy you know a pizza right now if i want to and i was like well that's pretty sweet i never had to talk to a banker fill out an application do a credit check i didn't have to do anything and i was able to get a loan and now what a lot of people do is they do that they put ether up they get a loan of some stable coin they use a stable going to buy more ether or to go buy some other coin and kind of gamble like kind of like leveraged gambling so there's other things you can do but i just did a really simple one with where furcon was showing yeah and uh i think uh lending is a big part of it i mean lending is dangerous in many ways like you know i look at lending as like this is bad that's my first reaction to any lending thing because people do that right they basically um take it and they leverage if you take it and you have purpose behind it and you're a long-term holder of something that makes a lot of sense right like you can kind of do that and and the reason i find defy exciting is you could take all the rules that you've seen get destroyed in like you know the 2008 crash or the dot-com crash and you could put a contract where that can't happen and so for example there's this protocol called liquidity protocol it's a new protocol they do zero percent interest loans on your ease so you can put up ease you take a zero percent loan and what they've done is they've created this system where they have a stability pool that will liquidate people if they go below their collaterization ratio and so what happens with banks explain that in simple terms so okay so how do i how do i get um how do because they're not doing a credit check because they're not asking for my w-2 income how do they make sure that this loan eventually gets paid back how do they do that so you put in let's say 100 ethereum right so you put in some amount that has a dollar value today and they let you take out their token called l usd it's like a usd stablecoin uh so now you have the stable coin you can trade it for other stable coins or other coins or take it to coinbase you know using whatever mechanism and kind of get it to dollars uh what you've done is you've put up your ethereum and you have to basically maintain some what they call collateralization ratio like you have to be over the lending amount by at least 10 percent otherwise you're going to get liquid and the action of liquidating means somebody will go and take your ethereum and buy it for a discount because they have to do this liquidation task and you know that's the risk you're putting this collateral up like you would in in another case now so it's like if you know i take a mortgage out i can't make my mortgage payments because i lost my job well the bank has my house as collateral they can foreclose on my house it's the same concept but instead of a physical house it's whatever collateral you put up initially to get the loan your stake and so the danger is i put up ethereum the price of ethereum is very volatile it goes down a lot i was aggressive with my ratio and i kind of went below this number and i got liquidated i still have my loan amount right so but there's obviously risks with these platforms like there would be a risk of buying a you know investment property and not being able to make rent on it or not be able to make mortgage what i like about it is the underneath where um in 2008 the bankers just went to the government and whoever else and was like we need new rules right now we're dying and so you kind of invent new rules this rule is built into the protocol if you're at below this ratio some liquidator can come in and and be the liquidator you can't you don't get a choice of hey is this going to happen or not it's encoded and so when you build you know financial products with you know directly encoded values it makes it so that it's going to happen whether it's a good situation for you or not whether they like you know how you presented yourself or not like you know and and having gone through you know bad times as a founder and gone through bad credit like i don't have good credit today still it's like i have a lot of money in the bank and sometimes i can't go get a credit card because like literally my credit still sucks from like whatever seven years ago or five years ago however long ago those problems were um and if one little things happen like i had a small credit card that i forgot about it's literally a 300 thing i missed some like yearly you know payment fee because you know every year you got that fee man it showed up on my credit oh that's a huge ding doesn't matter who you really are what you can do if that financial system sucks if you have the ability to kind of um do some of these actions i believe you should be able to do them and that's the most interesting thing about d5 is so that's permissionless so that's the general like that's a good i think general overview because most people don't really understand what what what is even the point of this how does this work uh let's go specific are you doing anything cool with d5 do you have any good trades going are you making money doing this are you are you actually doing anything in the device space right now i think uh uniswop is probably one of my favorite companies in the space and i think we've talked about this a little bit but what unit swap did and i'll give you kind of the simple version of it is usually when you wanted to trade two assets you had to create a marketplace so let's say i have one sean coyne and i want to sell it i need sam to show up and buy that sean coin right and if there aren't two sides and they don't agree on the price this trade won't happen and what uniswap did and i think there were some others before it but uniswap has become the biggest player in this space is they created a one-sided trading market where you know a buyer or seller can show up and they're trading against what's called a liquidity pool the investors come in and put in both sides of the trade marketplace so like one ethereum and three thousand dollars would create like let's say a liquidity pool then sean you can just show up and say i want to sell and you're going to sell against this pool uh you don't need another side the pool is always the other side and they've created a simple algorithm they call it like you know an amm and automated market maker where you know they want to keep the price close and depending on how much liquidity there is and how much you're willing to sell it's going to slip away from that amount and that's where the price movements will happen and you were in those pools you were saying i'm making good money by being the liquidity pool give us a sec what what was the yield you could get let's say you put a thousand dollars in what were you making being the liquidity provider so uh obviously in the earlier days of unit swap the pool yields were very high like you could see 100 plus on like fairly good assets and and it's really important to think about you have two sides of this market right so if you have if you're in the ethereum and us dollar pool when ethereum is going up you're like losing some of it right because you're giving it away uh to kind of to kind of like receive basically dollars and you know so if you want to hold a lot of ethereum long run it doesn't really make sense to be in some of these pools that are unaligned so i always try to find things that are connected together so like two stable coin pools a usdc and dipole that does you know anywhere from like eight to fifteen percent and that's been like that on the low end of the spectrum for the last year plus i mean i'm holding effectively what you know we'll call it dollars on both sides of the puzzle and people need to trade between these assets and i'm willing to be the trade partner for them along with a lot of other people and you basically get a little bit of a fee and that's where the liquidity pool makes money so holding you know dollar on this side or a dollar on this side feels good if there's something very well aligned with ethereum so if you believe ethereum and bitcoin will kind of together flow upwards that could be a very good pool for you to kind of take what they call rap bitcoin and ethereum and be in that pool and uniswap made all this happen from the consumer side to make a one-sided trade but also as an investor to come into a liquidity pool and say hey i'm willing to kind of put up both of these assets and then i want to make some fees as people do this right okay so all right so that's that's good i think a little probably a little too complicated for the general audience at this point so i'm wearing a harvard shirt that's about it oh sorry my sean i told you about this book i read about vertical farming and uh you know basically like i read that wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute you guys just were talking about crypto stuff and then he just said i've got something i think sam will like farming this was one of our cool [ __ ] hours was he's like i came in thinking he's going to tell me about you know wbtc and i'm like oh [ __ ] i got to go look up all these acronyms he's like no vertical farming i was like oh brilliant tell me about it right because furcon's got a wide range some days i remember early on at when we were working together he was like when uber had just kind of was getting big he's like i'm thinking he's like i got a bunch of friends we're kind of like you know not doing a whole lot nowadays i'm thinking about just renting like five by five cars and just having them like run a fleet like i think i could just make x dollars doing zero work by running my own little taxi fleet on uber or he was like uh you know there's these i forgot what it was float spas or cryo tank yeah company what was that one that you were really into yeah uh you know the cryotanks are something that you know if you have bad joints like me it's like a you know night and day difference on how your body feels and so you know like i still want to put one in and i think in the lab that i'm spinning up over here we'll get to that probably at some point but wait what's the what's this what's said lab i'm i'm building a hardware and robotics lab here in san francisco as a part of f dot inc and you know the idea is software you can do in a coffee shop and a living room but you can't really build any one of these even off-the-shelf hardware products in your living room and so what i want to do is take a lot of founders who are interested or future founders we're interested in building these ideas i'm going to have a machine shop and an electronic shop and a robotic shop in this facility gonna be in this iconic location and my goal is just to get like a bunch of talented hungry people in this roof and just have a great energy and build together and so you see these companies form out of universities because they have two things they have a shop there that you can access mostly for free and then they have people in the shop that turns into your community like as a kid i can just show up and stand next to you while you're doing something and you go you don't give me a weird look you go oh you wanna you know how to use this no okay let me show you like that little bit might be the difference between you willing to try and kind of get into a field or not and uh where are you going to support that what was that where where in the city you said it's iconic location can you see yeah we're looking at a place at fort mason in san francisco so it's not complete yet um but that's kind of like for me like the iconic locations or i can see the golden gate bridge i can be on the water we've explored stuff on the piers in general uh in chrissy field fort mason like these locations when i go there i get excited you know like going to monkey inferno was a fantastic office but now outside it wasn't that great like soma mission these areas i don't get excited when i go there and i usually do there too much how much are you willing to invest in to sink into this thing to make it interesting it's gonna be a lot it'll probably cost about half a million bucks a year just to even like have the base building in place and uh you know my guess is it'll be double that just from you know the people that i want to bring in and kind of investments i want to do and what i want to support uh i want to like i i actually ran a plastic fabrication shop in a small machine shop a long time ago and so i've done a lot of this i've welded and now i've worked on cars so like i actually have a lot of this interest and uh i'm more excited to have my own cnc and my own machines and things to work with as well so dude you're so cool yeah so sam the reason i said you're gonna like this idea in companies because uh i don't listen to very many podcasts but i do listen to this podcast this is probably the only one i listen to this is not maybe we're taking that testimonial to the moon and i'm not even just pampering you guys sean i mean you know me i'm not going to tell you like it is but i really do listen to you guys i know because i'm pretty sure you didn't listen at the beginning when i was just interviewing folks and then now that it's ideas it's shooting the [ __ ] sam's here he's listening now yeah and uh so you talked about like hey you know you just sold the company by the way congratulations to you as well and uh you were talking about how like you want to get your hands kind of into things and yeah you want to like do some of that so i was like oh okay if i ever get back on the pod i'm gonna tell sam about this idea uh and so i'm by the way i'm sitting here taking notes i'm just writing all this down and so i read this book and this book was talking about vertical farming i think i don't know i don't remember the name of the book but basically um you know the first couple of chapters it really talks about what the major problem in the us is as you know as you're producing a lot of food and the world right the world went from i think 3 billion people 100 years ago to like almost 8 billion now like it's a pretty massive difference in like how many people are on the world you're starting to see effects like we see the wildfires here in california you hear about all these things and so what's happening is as you start farming in soil you basically destroy the soil and after some period of time you get no yield out of the soil and so about 10 years ago 15 years ago vertical farming got very popular as a way to put food production closer to cities like new york city requires you know millions of acres outside of new york city to support it wouldn't it make sense for that to be in the city well how do you do that well you could put it in these buildings you could put it under kind of uv lights and you could drive water through it through hydroponics and this got really popular a lot of people invested in it uh so it's kind of like a particular time it's for someone like me who's zero zero nature knowledge what would to make paint a mental picture what is a vertical farm bro have you never grown weed in your in your apartment no i don't smoke weed i never grew weed i don't do drugs i don't do crimes i don't i don't die there but i feel like every 16 year old has at least grown one pot plant at red high school yeah so you know you know you think about plants in the ground because they need kind of nutrients from soil but really they just need some of those nutrients and you could just put them as long as you deliver them to the roots it's going to pull that in and so people figured out hey you can grow stuff without soil and that that's a huge that's just a big unlock because it doesn't have to go in the ground so it's going to use water right correct to use water and there's been more advances now where it's not just water but it's like you know i think they call it aeroponics but it's just misted right so it's kind of like more yield against the root and you know you still have to power it with sunlight so you could put it inside a warehouse but you need sunlight and so big uv lights was kind of the strategy and so phase one of vertical farming was we're going to put them in high rises we're going to take some floors and we're going to turn them into a farm floor and that should support the building and these are normally the pictures that you see what people are kind of dreaming about vertical farming it's a giant building where a bunch of them are farms and it looks cool uh but in practice it was like kind of a warehouse like a data center and you know that's where it ended up living and i think that's fine the the reason these guys i got excited about they're called nebulum farms and what they do is they basically have uh direct to consumer um lettuce micro greens and tomatoes that's what they sell you and so you know they started kind of in a different phase like kind of like hey we're building cool tech like we've been in this sean before where you're excited about computer vision and doing this thing but actually along the way they realized well we don't really want to license out our thing we can't franchise this we can't do like all these other ideas we had people actually just want this and what if we could put up a farm near you and i think they have their first farm in idaho and they just have a monthly subscription to get lettuce and tomatoes and these things show up to your door and i mean today they do same day harvest to delivery because they've kind of taken the process down to this simple thing they have this basic form and you can see some of the pictures that they have on their website of what their farm looks like uh but it looks like a little data center it's like a rack of lettuce there's a little light that will kind of rotate and like give it sunlight and on the top there's a mister that kind of like you know make sure it's called what's this called nebulum farms nebula b-u-l-l-a-m farms and you know like if you ever get a chance to go taste some vertical farmed lettuce you will notice the taste difference like it is not the same lettuce you're like wait lettuce has taste it is good crispy like it actually makes a huge difference in the quality of product and i believe they can make this happen you know same-day harvest to delivery for a large part of america so what they're on their website it says less water so you use 98 percent less water and in places like california where there's like droughts water shortages that's a big deal no pesticides because it's an indoor sort of controlled environment and no soils to know bugs right that's why you don't need the pesticide right uh it says less human handling i don't know about that uh so always fresh and basically the the goal would be hey here's an eco-friendly thing but also this taste this produce it tastes better and you've actually had it so what's the no [ __ ] like is it if i didn't know blind taste test would i be able to tell the difference between these two or whatever yeah and we should do this like you know there's a couple of other brands that have gotten popular that you can pick up in stores i think there's one called plenty uh that shows up in stores um and i think there's a lot of people that have wanted to do this but if the business isn't gonna work the tech is not gonna hold it right like that's the same thing as software like this problem exists everywhere and so if you're building some emerging tech thing you can't keep talking about how great the tech is and so the direct to consumer angle it resonated with me because it's like okay i've seen grocery delivery i've seen some of these things where you could get like fruit in a bar well if you can produce the fruit yourself like you just have a machine that can produce fruit that's the vertical farm well why don't you become the biggest farm in america really quickly by kind of going city to city and doing that and you've seen uber you know kind of build the biggest farm in america now right now the way that he was describing i'm like all right they're mailing plants that's not that i mean yeah that's like it's they're okay it's like different lettuce it's it's it's like a candle it's like those candles that have a ring in in the bottom when you melt the candles it's like a sticky novelty type type of thing it's cool once or twice but the way that you're describing it now i think precon i think what you're really good at is something i'm not as good at which is like you're really good at breaking your frame and like changing i don't know if i'm even phrasing this correctly but kind of changing the whole paradigm which is like no no we're gonna build the largest farm in the world and now when you say that i think man so you're just gonna have to buy all this land and have this massive huge feel but you're kind of saying like oh but by the way by farm i mean it's like these little small things in every convenience store in america do you know what i mean yeah and uh that that's kind of like the trade-off here which is you know a farm that's like maybe you know in a 50 000 square foot building that might be like you know thousands or tens of thousands of like land acres that you're replacing because vertical farming does many things it reduces the water but it also compacts how much space you need to do the action so instead of buying large masses of land to produce this you can buy warehouses or facilities closer to the city center and serve that area right and so if you can be near like a city like austin or san francisco you can kind of serve that city kind of efficiently with kind of a smaller you know kind of smaller brilliant yeah that's so cool and dude like i think what you're really good at like when i'm around you i feel so inspired and i want to bring something up in a second that's related to this but basically like you are the type of i hate when we talk about san francisco it's this lovely place everyone needs to go but the type of people like you there was a large density of that in san francisco and i am not at all naturally like you but i felt i improved and just changed my opinion on so many things after hanging out with people like you i don't know what we call that i think sean is a little bit more like you than than i am but we we also have a handful of friends that are like that and they just like you guys think about stuff in such a way where maybe it's like when i asked some when i asked my challenge myself to come up with an idea or think about what's the possibility of x y and z i put these constraints on where like um well there's no way i could pull off this because that technology for this doesn't work or i'm not good enough to do this or but that's it's always been done x um whereas when you think of stuff you're really good at being open-minded and defaulting to like well let's actually that is kind of interesting let's play that out and you don't have these constraints of like being held back that a lot of normal people like me have i think do you know what i mean sean yeah um i i think it's simpler than that i think fer khan is you know everybody uses their own frame of reference their own lens and uh he looks at things through the lens of a technologist so i think and i i remember sitting down next to you and being like how did you get the way you are and you're like well like i remember when i was five my dad bought home brought home like a printer and like we put it together right wasn't that the story like a computer or a printer when you're like five or six years old yeah since my earliest memories it was an xt computer it was kind of like you know not even doss yet it was just like a screen and uh he put it together we booted it up and i remember he had like a disc that had you typed like auto exec i was just a kid i knew how to type a-u-t-o-e-x-e-c if i press enter i get to this like simulation football game and that's all i could do like you pick a play and it runs it for you you don't even you don't even actually play the game but like i remember that as the earliest memories and i mean i got started really young like i worked at a.com when i was 15 and just like my my hobbies ended up being very valuable like i wasn't a you know not a musician where you know i would have had it made it really big it was like i was into computers and programming and doing things like that and uh those things just happened to have become very valuable especially in the bay area and that that kind of like lended itself to a lot of opportunities also something that you're gonna do with this what do you what are you calling your space again uh we call it founders inc that's like the company name so i i want to like tell a quick story about that so back in 2000 and sean i can't see your face so i can't see if you're i can't tell if you're on board with this story but uh you back in 2013 so basically sean why didn't you start as the monkey inferno uh like the guy inside joined uh at the end of 2012 so basically 2013 is kind of the actual beginning so around that time i was working out of that i was i just sold something and i didn't make a lot of money but like 100 grand let's say and i was looking to start something else and i found this guy named dave and he had a thing called founders dojo which was basically he rented an office it would he i don't know dave had a business that probably did half a million in sales and he probably profited 400 000 so he wasn't a rich rich guy but he had this office that he could spend 3k on a month and he let me and like eight other people come and work out of his office and he uh we heard about it through friends of friends like hey there's a thing called founder dojo they're letting like people just work there and it's a dingy office it wasn't nice it was maybe six 500 square feet and then down the street was the same thing but it was far fancier it was called monkey inferno it was pretty much the exact same thing but like way better it was this guy named michael burch who was on the podcast if you look up the hippie who made a billion dollars that sean did that episode and it was a guy who started and sold the company for hundreds of millions or close to a billion dollars and his like project was the same exact thing it was nicer you know they had like you guys probably had like hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of interior decorating and uh it was like really fancy but it was the same thing basically of like nerds and like weirdos and misfits we all would come to these spaces and i would hang out monkeying for it all the time and you guys sometimes came to our thing and we would we would dork out to the stuff that people would make fun of like dave loved meerkat meerkat was uh basically a live streaming app which kind of like was the early technology and early behavior for even like a like a clubhouse or whatever um and he would do this thing called a marathon he called it and he would meerkat for 24 hours straight he would be in the office mere catting for 24 hours straight and he would meet these other dorks and they would come and fly into our office and then um it was just so weird like we did all this weird [ __ ] one time we created this thing called uh what do we call it uh coffee coffee rush we called it and you click a button and you get coffee inside like 20 minutes wherever you are in san francisco and all these just nerdy dorky little projects but it was like the best time of my life and it was the most one of the most formative it was some of the best experiences i ever had as it relates to business and just like becoming a man and like tinkering with all these new things and having an open mind and i think what you're setting up for con is like the next obviously this is like the next iteration of that and i'm so fortunate that i've had people like you and uh and you guys have birch michael burch and i had dave grossblatt i'm so fortunate that people like you guys exist in this world because these little silly things that like are fun and like that seems stupid on the outside and the fact that there's these grown adults who are thankfully wealthy enough and willing to bet their money to do this stuff it sounds outrageous and it sounds like a movie and i'm so happy i was part of it and it made such a huge difference um it's like the fact that these exist it's a movie 100 and uh those places you talk about so i know david grossblatt as well and uh you know i used to go to another place growing up hacker dojo it was mountain view and uh you know even growing up in silicon valley you didn't immediately have like a network like i don't know like a bunch of vcs just from growing up here that's not actually not how it worked my block didn't have vcs on it it was just normal people and uh you know you really didn't find people like yourself and so the internet changed a lot right like it allowed people to connect with each other and find each other but you know the in-person interactions they just operate differently and it's a lot more ad hoc like i remember you being at the monkey inferno and a lot of other you know people that we would have work out of there it was cool because you could just walk by break up a random conversation talk about something and maybe it resulted in nothing and sometimes it would actually stick with you and it would be really important and so um at applovin it felt the same way early on when we were kind of doing these like you know random ideas it was like oh we're just a bunch of misfits together here that are just going to go on this journey and that energy is just hard to replace and it was really fun and every time it's been there it's been really instrumental for me and like learning a lot like conversations during the lunch table at monkey inferno shaped a lot about how people think what are you know what are ways to conduct yourself like just things even outside of tech right like you interact with a lot of different people and you can bring good energy to it and uh i think it's really critical and so i've been on this mission slightly before kova to kind of like build this facility but then kind of covet happened and you know obviously like it's good in terms of like new buildings new opportunities cheaper rent here in the city great but i think this thing is kind of necessary for a lot of people who are in this builder phase you know like they might not be a founder yet they might not go raise a bunch of money they just want to build some stuff and hack on it and i'm willing to kind of take a bet to build that facility and on this podcast we talk a ton about like buying businesses and we almost get to the point where it almost sounds like we're a bunch of like uh banker pe types where it's like oh this is an interesting opportunity but the coolest [ __ ] that i've ever done and the most fun i've ever done is just dorking out with like people that were like me and just like oh this is kind of funny like this is silly like we could do that it all starts like this is so stupid it's so fun and sometimes it like turns into really cool amazing stuff and and i think that that's fun to remember that that should that should that should be how a lot of stuff starts or um maybe like maybe it's not should be but it can be that way which is i think better yeah organic organic is awesome right it just means that we just kind of sat around we brainstormed some ideas some of our experiences we tried some things uh you need to be able to try things i think that's like really important and if i can reduce uh you know for me growing up i didn't have a lot of like people that i could lean on that's like they had done this already or they were doing businesses it was just like kind of fail as you go take a bunch of scars and uh you know finding like people like adam and sean like was critical for me in the sense that like i had people that i could talk to about business things that like maybe other people i couldn't interact with and i just want to kind of if i can take that for let's say like sean said earlier uh you know myself 15 years ago i could give myself some of that like that's what i that's what i feel like i'm kind of building over here yeah there's what's that cheesy phrase that's great but cheesy it's like be the person you needed when as you know when you're a kid or something like that uh it's one of those things that like if everybody actually did it you know the world would sort of be a good great place um and and i think that's what in many ways you're doing uh i don't know what i needed i i sort of like had a different journey where i was like just kind of on autopilot for like 20 years uh didn't have an entrepreneurial bone in my body uh didn't think about stuff i just kind of was going with the flow pretty like you know i was trying to try to do good at school but i was okay it wasn't wasn't the best wasn't particularly a hard worker wasn't doing anything interesting wasn't great you know socially and i just felt like i kind of woke up when i was 21 years old it started you know when i had my first idea for a company that's when i started to be more like me and so i think everybody you know okay why do i do this podcast well i'm not going to say i do it to give back like that's not why i do it because it's fun but the side effect of doing it is that the person who's me when they're 18 17 16 20 years old or 30 doesn't even matter how old if you're kind of in that autopilot phase where you don't feel like you found your thing or you don't feel like you know you're excited every day to wake up then all of a sudden you hear a couple guys on a podcast shooting the [ __ ] they sound really excited about life they got great energy they get ideas for days and you start to look at yourself like why don't i see ideas all the time how are these guys able to come on the podcast two times we can do it and so what does that do it proliferates more people that are like me that's you know what i want you know i i am the way i want to be so that hopefully i can like you know incept a bunch of other people in their brain that maybe they can pick that up right podcast a vehicle to do that you're doing the same thing you know when you were growing up you were you know messing around with hardware and cars and uh business when you were 15 16 years old and you were just messing around with computers and so and a bunch of people helped you out right your dad bringing home the computer or i think you told me about a guy kind of in your neighborhood who had like the car stuff that you could use to go work on cars if you didn't have that hardware and you picked up those hobbies and you just followed those hobbies you double down triple down even though that wasn't the common path right the common path was finish college get a job like get married have kids whatever right like everybody has this like path that's kind of like your parents and society sort of throws at you and you went off that path i think when you went off that path you probably didn't have as much guidance as like you're able to provide to that next wave where they should go on to do bigger and better things because you know you're able to knock down a few of those walls for them or with them yeah and uh i i like how you phrased it uh the cheesy phrase is obviously interesting but like i don't think giving back is the right that's not the right way to frame this because it's like it's not charity right like obviously like i'm building a business i do believe in the long run uh i want to make money with this business and then things i'm gonna invest in are gonna in the long run pay off for me monetarily as well but as a side effect uh i i do believe that you know kind of like your podcast like you're gonna inspire a lot of people i would love to inspire the next like thousand builders or founders kind of however you wanna phrase it and i think that side effect is fantastic i don't think that business has to be you know detached from you know some side effect like i think it's if i wanted to make it a charity i'd make it a non-profit right like that would be the way to go and that would be kind of the way to do it but i think there's a lot of benefit and a lot of people will benefit hopefully from it and ideally not just because of me like hopefully it's more like i don't know what the discord has become it's like founders helping each other like that's the best version of this and if i could be maybe the person that can first create the circle then awesome like that would be the hope over here what's the biggest kind of like common mistake or trap you're seeing when you have those kind of young entrepreneurs in the discord working on their projects what is the advice you keep on giving over and over again that like you feel like is the common the common mistakes the common traps that they're falling into i think it's always you know what are you focused on so like if you're a builder you're probably spending a lot of your energy on building and if you're you know really most of these companies will kind of die in the market not attack and there's some challenges sometimes but even as a technology person i would not spend too much time on technology and sean you experienced this firsthand like how many times was i like we'll just hack it in and all the engineers are like cringe right it's like well we have to like we need to go win this market or figure out if this is real or not if it's not real we need to move on from this very fast because we're just wasting time money energy and probably your company if we go down the wrong path here and so it's pretty much always focused on you know for me a lot of the advice is like go be more aggressive on growth go figure out your market go understand your customers use technology as a weapon for that not it's not the purpose that you're building like you're going to sit here build this technology somebody else is going to go take your market probably with the same technology by the way sam i don't know if you have a hard stop but there's one other one that i think is is interesting that uh furkan could talk about i don't know if you can talk about it but pac protocol or yeah i don't know can you talk about that or is either that or i think you know the way you're setting up the dow or any dowser you're a part of i think are interesting so pick one of those two and then talk about that yeah so uh you know dow decentralized autonomous organization i'll call it a decentralized org it's a little bit simpler to understand is really just kind of like this thing happening in the crypto world where um people are forming effectively these partnerships together they're doing it on you know on chain meaning as like an actual organization that kind of owns this code and things like that and so so let me let me simplify for a second so sam and you started the hustle you probably made a delaware c-corp right so you go to delaware that's the rule of law that's kind of where you're going to go write down all your articles of incorporation and you chose c-corp as the like structure of your organization and that lets you do certain things you could take investment you could do this you could do that and so you could do an llc you could do a s-corp you could do it in nevada you could do in california so those are the current ways that you start when you have a project where you need a bunch of people to work together and be financially incentivized as a group you you traditionally you would use you know a delaware c-corp or llc or something like that so what he's providing what he's talking about is an alternative that's been made and i i think forgot the trick here is what do they let you do that's different than just making it why why don't i just go to an llc or a c corp uh in delaware well it lets you first be um you know it lets you kind of detach yourself from the legal entity and how you were kind of like having your stake of ownership and kind of voting and governance of the company so like you know we talked a lot sean before of like man it kind of sucks companies are like top heavy and everybody's putting a lot of energy and effort and yeah you might need a person that's responsible for making these choices but wouldn't it be cool if and you know a bunch of people on the internet basically took that wouldn't it be cool if we made a company that could be owned by everybody equally and he could do things like voting or managing the treasury or issuing new you know tokens or shares to people and you could incentivize them however you wanted so like if you bring on some people to help you market and like some let's say a big celebrity you can issue some governance to them like they could be a part of this you can align incentive between investors founders community the market whoever you want and so here's an example of one right that you've showed me so there's this thing called the lao have you ever heard of this sam so the lao lao what it is is it's a venture fund but instead of um like if you go to sequoia sequoia's got you know let's say the gps the general partners it's got the managing director maybe and it's got then the associates and the analysts it's like a traditional company it's like a pyramid at the top is the people in charge and what the dow is is basically here's a fund you put your money in for however much money you put in you get certain number of tokens tokens are like shares and uh and then there's nobody specifically in charge and the fund basically can receive proposals so there's just they have a website you can pitch them the pitch goes in everybody gets it in their inbox everybody votes yes or no based on how many tokens they hold that's their vote that's their weight and then if the majority of the dow has voted yes it gets the treasury which is the bank account for the for the for the lao will pay out that project here's your investment and uh and then at any time i if i don't like the lao i can just sell my steak sell it to anybody else they could take my spot and allow um and you know now they own they have that chair so it's completely liquid at all times whether there's maybe there's been great projects in there and now these things looked really valuable these tokens look more valuable than the initial money that was put in well i can sell out i don't have to wait 10 years for those projects to pan out i can sell out today at two that double my money or um you know i can say i wanna i wanna have more control i'm gonna buy out more tokens so that i have a greater say in this community because i'm gonna spend a bunch of time and i really wanna make sure my my vote matters and basically it ties your vote to your sort of your merits how much value you put in in this case how much money you put into the lao so they did it as an investment vehicle other people did it as an art collecting vehicle put money in buy art art is owned by the group and you could sell in in whatever so there's these uh headless companies there's no ceo in a suit at the top that is telling everybody what to do and deciding who gets hired and fired it's just a bunch of shareholders together and you vote based on your shares it's like you know more like america like a democracy i guess and then yeah there's other variations of that too that i can't even wrap my head around those are the simple ones i've understood there's others that i don't even understand yet yeah it's it's very complicated very very complex but the simple version i like how you phrase it is kind of like a democracy times a company uh you know mixed in one and maybe companies even the wrong phrasing there but you know i'm very fascinated with this it's a very different pattern i don't know if it's better or worse than you know what we've seen traditionally but it's definitely different right and uh i've been wanting to kind of like you know be a part of one create one and so i joined a couple but i'm not like you know some meaningful stakeholder in it but then you know with a lot of the work that's been going on in nfts a lot of popularity the top shot is just like taking over like my friends group and uh very popular and i know you're super into like bitcloud and some of these other uh platforms and so i've been wanting to kind of wrap my head around nfts and i started talking to a lot of developers and people that are interested about some of these ideas that i had and i found like a group of five six people that i'm like oh we're we're all kind of really into this let's make a dow i'll like kind of put in the first amount of money and now a couple of my buddies are also putting in some money for getting some stake in this and the idea is we're just going to be kind of a group of people that are going to build fun projects in the nft space and our goal is there's a lot of hype right now we're in that hype cycle life cycle is going to go away right it's the same pattern that we talked about before well what is the valuable things that nfts can do let's go build some of these and so you know we have two ideas that we're working on right now as a group one of them is like shopify for nfts like you come in you click two buttons and you like you can create your own and you know i'll ask you this john like you've heard a lot about nfts you've talked a lot about him have you minted your own yet i have not why not uh i don't know what the hell my nft would be so like for example we have a friend jack butcher who has minted many nfts now himself and he's a great designer so he makes like a cool visual it's like badass art and he's like oh cool instead of just posting this for free on twitter for likes i'll post this on foundation and i'll sell it and he sold some of these for 60 70 000 each um and so he's made you know a lot of money this year just basically selling his own kind of like his philosophies he just makes into a kind of a digital poster and he sells that digital poster to his fans and so for me i'm like oh that's cool if i made an nft i don't know i don't have that artistic skill i don't even know what the actual nft would be that's kind of my thought and then but you haven't even just tried one right like when you first saw shopify you went and created a store right like you didn't you didn't have to start a company you know or sell something but you wouldn't do it one's easier than the other one you're typing in a user fake new username and password yeah exactly i mean if i open the shopify store i also need to put a product there right like i can't also have a yeah you can you can try that's the thing that i saw is like a lot of this uh these worlds defy nfts the dollar value is really big at the top end of it when you go and dig underneath and you're like ah there's only like 5 000 users doing this why is it so little right and there's a lot of interest in doing it really hard to do and i believe that's like one of the biggest opportunities in nfts is just like make make it really easy for people to do it almost as easy as creating a shopify store so that's like project idea one like we're gonna basically pay for your gas we're gonna make it so you can deploy your own contract without ever thinking about it you're gonna just click a couple buttons and get a landing page that you can send to people and they can buy stuff digitally okay we're gonna make it literally that easy so that's i think that's like accessibility really important um second one which is the thing you were talking about which is the pax protocol like you know there's building products and then there's building protocol and protocols are just like here's an api to go do this thing and nba top shot i mean probably one of the biggest digital products we've seen since pokemon go i'll kind of call it that like that wave of like hype you know reaching some mass market um a lot of interest in it uh but it's very close right i mean you have to be an nba player to get one you have to kind of like be in the nba you got to play in this whole ecosystem and you know who knows what they're going to be worth in the long run but in the short run there's a lot of interest there but only the nba is doing it you'll see the other sports teams do it and but the basic idea of creating a pack with some digital items in it or potentially kind of linking to the real world that's kind of what i got really excited about and so we you know as part of nft labs we created this axe protocol which is a protocol to create kind of a you know like a little loot box pack where you can put in digital items and you could put in an image a sound clip for like let's say your guys podcast or you know kind of access like hey here's a ticket to a vip event that i'm gonna do here or there's a meet and greet or here's my private community and so creators are gonna find a lot of ways to use this if we develop that underneath foundation that they can kind of do all this and so so sam does that make sense of how so like for example what we would do is we would say oh cool these guys built the infrastructure that makes it easy for us to do the following we can create these little packs meaning like a card pack or like a box like a loot box and basically you put it's a mystery box you don't know what's inside so you buy one you open it up and you're gonna get one you know maybe you get the crap or maybe you get the most vip thing where sam calls you and coaches you on your business for an hour and what's that called what's the what's the domain so nft labs dot co is kind of like the main domain so that's where that's one of their projects and so i think this is pretty cool because they're going to be able to get any like influencer like us and so there's one thing to do with jax doing which is and actually jack did this i don't know if you saw this uh furcon but he initially was selling a specific nft hey buy this thing and then he sold three packs with inside was a mystery nft he didn't know what he was gonna he made many six figures i believe yeah and like this mechanic many many games use these like loot box mechanics because it's fun it's fun to go buy the thing and see do you get the super rare valuable thing or did you get kind of the junk and you know you so you either get you know 60 cents on the dollar or you get 60 for every dollar you spent and there's like this game of chance and so what they're doing is they made a protocol where it's now easy for us to do that we could make all these packs we could put inside hey tickets to our live show in austin or you know you get to be put into our like private members group or here's a t-shirt you know with our you know here's a harvard shirt whatever um and so we could put any number of things just stuff them into boxes and assign some probability and then it'll generate the packs for us which i think is pretty sweet yeah and uh you know like i really just think a lot about like what what's the value underneath it like we have to get to you know i mean art has value you know obviously the person buying it cares about it but a lot of people look at that and go wait you know these things are selling for like 50 million bucks plus and like what's the you know it's just a jpeg underneath but like i mean a vip meet and greet when you guys do your road show that's pretty cool actually and i think a lot of people would be really excited about it it sucks if you only auction that off to the you know person who has the most money right like and i think these packs give kind of the you know creators and influencers a way to interact with their fans kind of more broadly and say all of you guys will get a chance and here's kind of the things of it by the way you know if there were only 10 vip meet and greets we'll make the third party marketplace like top shop or if somebody wants to go spend 100 grand for it by the way you guys will earn a cut of that secondary sale plus somebody who got that if they didn't want it and they wanted to sell it they can kind of do that and so you can support both sides of the ecosystem you can make it kind of fan friendly but then you can go kind of get a lot of value out of it too and so i don't know i find creators really interesting because they're kind of an analogy to founders where you know i don't want to go work at a fan company i mean you you know i i made it through twitch but it was not it's not the right environment right like it's not where i'm gonna thrive it's not where i'm gonna be excited and i think creators have the same thing i saw a great idea on this uh the founder of ripplet uh uh tweeted this out he goes there's a bunch of people who engineers who work at like fang companies they make great salaries and they kind of want they're kind of bored they want to go to a startup but the like the compensation difference is pretty big and maybe they have a family or they just you know it's just hard to walk away from a guaranteed you know five hundred six hundred thousand dollars a year to go work for one-fifth that or one-fourth that at a startup that may or may not make it and he goes somebody should just create a fund that just bridges the difference so what it does is it basically says great we will um we'll even out that difference so you get 300 instead of let's say 600 and it's an income share agreement and but you pay us back with your with stock from the from the startup and so you give up a little bit of the stock from the startup to make back the cash difference and in doing so you would create a port so you would it would help more people who today can't leave the salary go to a startup you'd help the startup not have to burn more money hiring that person and and use it in between and by providing that you would get shares in pretty much every startup that you wanted to provide this with so if you say you thought these 100 startups are great you could basically say great you're all eligible for this this like kind of like income share agreement that we do where if you hire somebody and they want a bit higher salary we'll front that salary in exchange for stock um and hopefully bring more talent into the startup workforce i thought that was a pretty clever idea a way to get shares in all the companies that you want shares in that you can't go invest in directly yeah that's really interesting and uh i don't know i think people should just you know ideally people can do the thing that they enjoy they wake up every day they're excited whether they gotta drive to work or work from home or wherever it is uh if you can do that like that that's a big unlock in your life and a lot of people don't get that opportunity and early on in my career i just made those trades like kind of no matter how financially painful or you know you know misguided it might have seemed at the time but like i just wanted to work on things that i was excited about and when you and everyone went to loving when you went to top 11 you had another job offer right uh what was the difference there yeah so i had met this guy jack levin i think he was like you know very early at google he was responsible for um you know kind of a lot of google's infrastructure tricks early on like how they really scaled it and some of the ways they win is really his responsibility and he was working on this company i think it was called why frog was it was like a photo sharing type thing i think they had run another product i think it was photo bucket something like that they had done some big stuff in the photo space they were doing really well they needed some engineers uh i was an engineer at the time and i could basically come in and learn a lot from this very technical person um seemed really sharp uh he asked me these questions that like got my brain going in a good way like you know very specific questions like how do you set up your desktop and like my desktop is very particular and he wanted to know every detail and i was like ah this guy gets it like this guy gets me in the same way um then i met adam and adam was like very different uh obviously very impressive as just a ceo and a person but like the conversation was different the vibe was different one was in like los gatos one was in palo alto just like a little bit of a different area but when i talked to adam i was like oh this guy i could go to a baseball game with him i could hang out with him he seems cool he seems very hungry they don't have a clue what they're doing right now like you know they're shutting down an idea they don't know what the next idea necessarily is gonna be i think it's gonna be a lot more fun the rate of learning is gonna be really high i might get more responsibility but the really good like kind of proper choice was going to this other job offer and adam gave me two options he gave me a higher salary and a low stock and a lower salary and a higher stock option and i was like i kind of just made the decision down to like well if i go with you know adam i need to take the low salary move back in with my parents like take the stock because like i'm gonna be in it for the ride but if i just kind of want to become an engineer and that's what i want my career to be i'm gonna go to this other company i'm gonna take the salary i'm not worried about the equity necessarily how big that is but i'm just gonna become a better engineer and uh i kind of picked the more unknown less uh polished option uh obviously worked out so i feel great about it but you took the move in with the parents option and yeah it took the move in with the parents in a absurd way yeah how old are you when you started uh at app11 um let's see probably like 25 26 no moving moving at home wasn't the worst but yeah it wasn't good maybe a little bit yeah 26 that's maybe just old enough where it's kind of like all right what are you doing but definitely not quite inconvenient socially yeah okay when you move out right so you move out of your house and you move back in it's not like a happy like uh yeah i'm winning high fives all around right yeah like no no i mean like you um you're like in your 30s or like you have a family like if you're happy you're like a little more established yeah okay yeah 26 is old enough that it's still like you can still [ __ ] around and maybe figure it out which you did uh yeah and you know what i mean you know i think you'll almost be a kid yeah exactly i i think for me it was just like i know i wanted to do this it sounded more fun more fun is always good uh you're gonna be you're gonna wake up you're gonna be excited to go to work it's not gonna be a drag like you know i would tell sean this all the time because we used to do sunday night call right where we would kind of think about the week and it was like my friends were always sunday night like oh man work tomorrow like sunday like sucks like weekends over and i always felt like hey it's exciting like more stuff's gonna happen this week's gonna be great like and that's a big difference if more people can do that like that that i think is uh when we did those sunday calls i remember i'd always be like oh like sorry i gotta like i'm doing this thing with family or friends or whatever i'm like i gotta go get on this call and they're like oh man you have to do calls on sunday nights and i was like i get to do calls like i'm i chose this i want to do this i can't wait for monday we got to do it tonight you know that was our mindset and like you know we didn't have as like spectacular of an outcome but i definitely had like a spectacular time building that out and learning all the different stuff so anyways i think that's that's if you take away one thing like maybe you didn't understand the technology but like the meta lesson of furcon to me is he always picked the more fun and interesting path regardless of the financial thing and then on the financial side just made sure that it was a bet on himself and a bet on equity so that if fun and interesting thing does pan out you actually do get paid out of it and i've seen him make that trade of like i'll work harder i'll earn less i'll move back in with my parents i'll you know all these things right like he's willing to work three times as hard as long as it's three times as fun and i think most people at least from where i come from they don't do that they when they make career choices it's a rational logical decision and i think that gets you to a certain type of outcome but if you hear these outcomes and you're like how do i get some of that i think you got to follow the irrational playbook a bit more i mean sean if you look across your journey at monkey inferno i mean you're a 24 year old pretty pretty green right like i think i saw your initial video interview that you had sent in uh through the monkey inferno and like uh whether the dollar outcome was there or not like i would say the rate of learning like the growth difference for you and i know for that for myself it's a massive difference like i'm embarrassed at what i used to think about back then in terms of building compared to kind of after the journey but you'd feel like that was like a thousand next payoff and the rest of your career is gonna kind of unlock because of it right like i i would imagine you believe that but i'm curious how you think about that journey yeah 100 i i told the guys who set up our studios this and um i mentioned this on a recent podcast but i said they came they they flew out here to san francisco they were like staying in a motel six type of thing they're like i'm gonna build this out and um you know they're 22 23 24 years old something like that and they had sent in a video like kind of like a video interview to be like sam sean choose us to like like we will help you guys out we will come build your studio for you they've like did a ballsy youtube video and tweeting at us like non-stop [ __ ] i used to do i used to wait in parking lots to meet ceos and investors i wanted to meet just so i could say i've been here since 7 00 am waiting in the parking lot for you to come out like do you have five minutes of time right i used to do all these stunts and they were doing a stunt to meet us and i thought that was kind of interesting and when they were there i was like uh they kind of were like deferring to me too much they were sort of like it's kind of like too much respect and i told him i was like dude you you kind of want what i have i want what you have i want that time back and i want to be back where you guys are where it's for friends living in a one-bedroom apartment and you're making videos and you kind of like why are we trying to be youtubers i don't know it seems fun let's just do it and then like we think these guys have a cool podcast [ __ ] it let's fly out and meet them and help them out with their studio and we don't know what's you know there's no there's nothing clearly in it for us but like we'll hop on that plane tomorrow and go make it happen i told him i said that was by far the most fun time um there was the highest rate of learning and i remember at the time feeling like oh man like everything we do is so bootleg and ghetto and like but that was the right path actually for me for a person like me who wanted what i wanted out of life and i said you're gonna i remember you know i went to duke most of my friends went to med school law school or banking or consulting and so every you know every weekend they would post like they're you know they're making six figures they're posting themselves at a bar they're like like i wasn't dating i had no income i was sleeping on an air mattress you know you know my my co-founder lived in my closet right so it was like you know it was ghetto and so i remember thinking well uh maybe you know there was moments of doubt where i was like maybe i should have gone the traditional path maybe i should have gone to med school after all but uh but it was so fun i couldn't you know i didn't there was not a real conversation in my head what i was telling these guys was yo uh you're gonna see your friends who are on the traditional path and they're going to look like they're way far ahead of you right now and there's going to be a part of you who feels like you're you're left behind uh if you're like me that's what i felt um stay the path and just know that like this is the first quarter we're going to be long-term oriented we're gonna think about this like in a 10 20 year time scale who do you want to be in 10 20 years and like you're gonna have a lot of fun now and then your rewards are gonna catch up 10 20 years from now and if you're okay with that trade of having more fun now and rewards that are a little back loaded this is the right path i wish somebody had just told me at that time guys this looks ghetto as hell but you're on the right path um we kind of just like for better worse just stuck with it and i want more people to stick with it when they're in that mode and you've done the same traveling through europe playing poker to support yourself and like you know moving back in with your parents it's not a it sounds at the time it feels uncommon but it's actually quite common amongst people who end up successful in an entrepreneurial way yeah flip side is just not easy right you're gonna go the harder path like you know i didn't i didn't have i don't have a college degree i didn't get that a lot of people ask me hey should i go to college like i have these other things going on and you know like you don't have to you can learn on your own especially now but um it's definitely gonna be a harder path don't expect linear returns where if i put in a year of work i get a year of kind of success and then i put in five years of work i get five years of success it might be nothing for a long time and you might kind of get it in the end but i don't know the journey is very exciting like that that that to me is what matters because that's what you're going to do every day you're going to wake up every day and you're going to go do this thing are you excited about that and that's kind of like critical yeah thank you dude i always take a lot of notes i'm taking notes now whenever you come i uh i'm excited for your success that's so cool i um thought app 11 was like this huge thing whenever it was supposed to sell a year or whatever a few years ago now and then now seeing what it is now i'm like oh my gosh that's that's it's it's blew my expectations i'm sure it is uh yours as well so congratulations that's pretty badass and what you're building is awesome founders inc that's badass yeah sweet no appreciate it and uh yeah no this has been fun uh i always like hearing you guys so it's kind of fun to be on as well and where do you shoot the [ __ ] a little bit where do people find you founders inc or founders.inc yeah f dot inc uh that's the website and so that's the domain uh you can find me on twitter fur con r uh are f-u-r-q-a-n-r [ __ ] on thanks for coming i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road less travel never looking back

if you're already doubting have having doubts or imposter syndrome that's you doing self-talk in your head that you're not the best that you're not good enough that you're not whatever well then maybe you should replace that with something that says i am the best right so that's where i got over the like uh is this kind of just like you know cheesy voodoo [ __ ] and i was like well no because there is self-talking happening no matter what it's either gonna be negative or it's gonna be positive i might as well actively make it positive i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like my days off on the road let's travel never looking back hey what's going on everyone we've got a good episode but before we get to it we've been releasing these new episodes called greatest hits they're actually not new to the world but they might be new to you but basically uh before we started doing the podcast as it is now it was just sean interviewing a bunch of people and we got like 20 or 30 in or he did and they were really good but they were about two years ago when we launched them and a lot of the people have done some really interesting things since uh or in that last two years and so we've actually been re-releasing them where i give an intro and there's also sean's intro where i'll give an update on the folks but anyway give it a listen and when you do uh make sure you click subscribe if you're on itunes so if you're listening to this on the podcast app click subscribe and then if you're on spotify click that follow button and the reason why is we're doing a bunch of these greatest hit episodes but i'm actually the one going in the back and finding all these old episodes and i'm trying to find all these interesting stuff so in the next couple weeks we're going to be releasing this series where we look at some of the the greatest predictions that we've made as well some of the worst predictions that we've made but we're not releasing them entirely on a regular cadence because i got to go and find all of them so make sure you click subscribe because a you can be notified when that new episode comes out and b it actually is going to help us go in the rankings and right now we're ranked like number 20 i think 20 or 19 in spotify in the business category and the higher we go up in rankings the more content we can do because the more listeners we have and well you get the idea so just please please please leave us review and uh sean what are we talking about in today's episode okay we talk about we're going to talk about uf the ufc the business of it as well as a pretty cool moment that happened in the the recent ufc fight um and we talked a little bit about self-talk which is us um something that we do both of us do that we don't usually talk to other we don't you don't usually admit to doing this and it's something that a lot of ufc fighters do self-talk before you have to go perform before you go and do your thing and so we talk about the ufc the business of the ufc we talk about self-talk and then we jump into some new some ideas sam had a great idea or met a guy who was doing a really cool idea around saving money on property taxes and this is a general class of ideas called money savers and then we have another another idea called the no loss lottery that we want to talk about so that's what today's episode is uh i think you guys will like it um especially the part about self-talk i think that's going to be the most popular part and we did have a few technical difficulties in this episode shawn's internet internet is not working so hopefully uh you won't notice too much but if you do sorry it's not gonna happen again so the editors i'm sorry you're gonna have to salvage like five restarts uh to the listeners hopefully it's not too bad uh we're finishing a conversation we're having about what we have to do um yeah we got to select a new i've got 89 drawings or art clips that we've got to select and then uh i'm having a bray you interview did we announce in the podcast about abraham no we didn't um a breeze leave it unfortunately um this was kind of part of the plan but it sucks so anyway we've got 50 people that we've got it sam have you had this before at the hustle where people want to leave to go do their own startup specifically not like i got another job but yeah yeah yeah most people yes um yeah i have i always tell them i'm like and i think abray is different because he wasn't a full-time employee but i'm like just so you know like it this feels like a startup now and it is a startup that but just so you know like don't even even the nice [ __ ] that we have at the moment don't expect any of that for a little while um and i'm like i always try to get them used to it i'm like just so you know it's gonna be really bad for a little while this [ __ ] hole is shitty wait until you start your own thing yeah so yeah that's happened a lot although abreu uh i think actually understands that he's been saving money he's been living at home and and stashing money or living somewhere where he has cheap rent so yeah i think he'll i think he'll do good we there's this thing called uh that reed hoffman wrote his book called the alliance he talks about this like back in the day people used to expect an employee to like kind of stay with you for 20 years like that was like people used to do that used to be the company from start to retirement and then that became less and less common and now i think in tech the average tenure of an employee is like two years or something like even less maybe yeah i think facebook it's even less so yeah so reed hoffman who was the ceo of linkedin the founder of linkedin he wrote this book which was like look you gotta you can't just uh you can't just close your eyes pretend that's not happening you can't get upset every time somebody leaves that's actually the norm so what's the right way to manage in this in this type of scenario and he calls it the alliance which is a mutual understanding between the person working with you and you and you as the manager i actually am very curious i want to know about this the alliance people leaving whatever yeah so i haven't read this book but uh oh great great great way to start off well i know of the book i understood the premise i didn't donate 90 of books that i'm a fan of i haven't actually read and this is one of them so what he says is basically you need to have like um understanding with your the person who's working for you or working with you that they're gonna be there as long as this is mutually beneficial and the expectation is that after x number of years two three four whatever that number is probably not much more than that that they may um they may leave and they may go do their own thing and that when that time comes you're gonna support them and then it's he's the way he talks about is like he's a big believer of networks and network effects he's like that person when they leave your company they're not just like sort of dead to your company they are now you know they should be your champion and your advocate outside your company and you'll cross paths again you'll either invest in their company you know they may come back and work for you later they may refer somebody in so he describes how how to like thrive get given the constraint that people are going to leave early on or in tech this high high turnover rate of one to two years people hopping jobs uh which is not what ray was doing but it just reminded me of that yeah and i still like the problem that i'm gonna solve for whenever i start a company again and even now but at least when i start from scratch i could i could hopefully do this early on which is basically how like how do you build a company where someone wants to work there for 10 years and and i still even even in this world where you know the average person only works somewhere two or four years i think it's quite possible though see my problem is that i like working with and try to recruit and get the best results from recruiting entrepreneurial type of people that like that's why i get along with that's who thinks like me that's who like works really really hard and these like bursts but those are like the worst people for retention because they want to go start their own company like that's that's why they're entrepreneurial type of people they're not going to be long-term employees sort of by definition and so i've always sucked at the retention side of things in that sense um but you know i'm cool with it i think i can just continually recruit more people that want that experience so before we get into some ideas for this episode can i tell you something that i saw recently and we're going to bring kind of this topic up we're going to talk about ufc but did you watch the rose number eunice no is it rose now i'm a eunice yep so there's a ufc fighter named thug rose she is uh like darling not like just like in terms of like physical like what she looks like in her attitude like darling is like the best word i can describe her although she could like kill you yeah so so the story of this is interesting right she's she's really i don't know she's five foot three she's very petite she used like have you seen her with long hair yeah she was like beautiful two beautiful looking girl and at the beginning the ufc was marketing their female fighters like with their kind of like sex appeal basically yeah right they made her wear like a like a bikini weigh-in which is just so stupid right and some some girls leaned into it like paige van zandt she got like a boob job and she's like she kind of sucks as a fighter she's like very mediocre but she's famous and gets paid well because she has good like sex appeal people want to watch her people are fans of her there's a karate fighter called karate hottie right that's her nickname the karate hottie because again she's like playing on that rose went the other way she's a beautiful girl and they were like oh do you want to go do dancing with the stars you want to like we can make you into a star and she's like [ __ ] that shaved her head and was like i don't want this whole beauty thing is a distraction i'm actually trying to be a martial artist and um and that makes her great and i think that there's like only a few sports in the world where the women are equally or more popular than the men i guess there's tennis maybe uh maybe national soccer team i think that's kind of the only other one that i can think of but in the ufc if you look at the top 10 most popular pay-per-views of all time it's like conor mcgregor and ronda rousey make up like collectively like eight of the top ten and whenever we think of like an amanda nunes fight i don't think like it's a great women's fight i think this is just awesome like if i put it yeah i'm gonna i'm just gonna watch this and anyway so i think it's good that i hope i think the whole bikini thing i think that's [ __ ] that was offensive by the way [ __ ] uh dana white was kind of famously uh was once stopped by tmz and they were like dana when will we see women fighting in the ufc and he was like never dude no we don't want to see nobody wants to see girls fighting in a cage and um and then he like you know did a complete 180 like to his credit changed his mind when he when ronda rousey came around was like okay she's a star i can build this whole side of the sport around this woman and he totally did and now it's like like you and me both you know when there's a great women's fight it's just as good if not better than the ben's heights yes and so there was a fight we didn't actually talk about it but it was two weekends ago um and this woman named rose domiunis she's awesome and there's this clip that i'll i'll share again so people can just go to my thing or somewhere to find it but basically she's uh in like first of all going into a cage like you're in your underwear you're getting watched by potentially million plus people um and you're like kind of fighting to the death even if you do have someone's gonna like stop you like the k the likelihood that you can die definitely i mean that exists so like you're going in like a life or death situation in your underwear in front of all your friends and family in the world and if you fail you sort of fall back to the bottom of the totem pole and you have to climb back up which is fighting a bunch of monsters along the way and it's like in a normal sport you go in i'm gonna play a basketball game i'm gonna play football game it's like i'm gonna play the game i hope i don't get hurt in a fight it's like first of all it's not even called playing you there's no play fighting it's just it's fighting it's actually it's not a sport you play and the second thing is you're definitely going to get hurt like that's just it's not like an aberration it's not like an unusual thing when you get damaged uh like you would in basketball with fighting you're for sure gonna take hits you're gonna you're gonna hurt yourself a little bit what the fighters say is like you know i left a piece of me in that ring and what they really what they really mean is like in a hard fight it's like i know that i just took six months like that's six months off my life i just really i left that in that ring so it's pretty amazing and i mean it's weird it's it's odd but i love it and in this fight the camera is that they're announcing she's fighting uh wayley was it way lee i think her name is yeah yeah this woman from china who's just like a beast she's like a terminator dude she's like so strong just unbelievably physically strong and again rose doesn't look like that she doesn't have bulging muscles she's her neck is not like popping with veins she looks like if you've ever watched stranger things she looks like 11 the character uh things and then they and and wait leah i love that woman as well she's great too but this thug rose is her name uh they zoom in on her face and she's saying i'm the best i'm the best i'm the best and she's saying it over and over and over again and in two minutes she was the underdog she was supposed to get her ass kicked and i actually would have bet that she was gonna get her ass kicked i thought i would have she was gonna get knocked out and within two minutes she did a uh front leg kick which is already kind of weird and knocked wayley out and the crowd it goes wild i remember watching it live i was like i was in tears i was so happy i have chills right now just remembering it rose kicks this woman in the head a minute and a half in two minutes in knocks her out we all go crazy and at the end her husband is her trainer or part of the training team and he gets down at her level like because he's like six five and she's probably five six five four and he looks at her face he goes we've been saying it for years you're the [ __ ] best no one can [ __ ] with you who's the best and she goes i'm the best and then in the interview with joe rogan he goes you kept saying i'm the best and he puts the mic to her and she goes because i am the best and i get i'm kind of getting uh emotional even remembering chills right now just while you're shocked because i was watching it and it was a very name it's i don't think if you didn't watch it if you don't if you don't follow the ufc you probably don't give a [ __ ] about this if you didn't watch it well hard to relate i think he even if i think if you don't watch it i don't think i think even if you don't watch the ufc you should go and watch this clip because this woman she's had emotional issues where she like has broken down from stress which is understandable given that like she's fighting to death so like fair it's just it was so the i think the key part of this by the way is that there's a lot of ufc fighters who are like all bravado like they always talk about how they're the best i'm gonna win i'm the best nobody can touch me i'm on another level blah blah blah she's not one of those people she's ultra quiet humble uh like a lot of people perceive her to be like sort of mentally weak because she's a had some issues before and b like she doesn't come out with that bravado typically so that's why it was very atypical to see this very sort of small this gentle giant basically like standing in the cage facing her opponent and just muttering to herself mouthing to herself you could see she was telling herself before the fight i'm the best i'm the best and it's from her it's not trash talk it's not bravado it was self-talk which is a very different thing she was trying to reinforce it to herself so she would go perform and then she performed like kind of a stunning knockout and the way in that she delivered the on the best line you could tell that her coach or it must have been her coach who is her husband was like rose you're the best as a matter of fact for the next year when i ask you who's the best you have to reply i'm the best or i'm gonna go make you do push-ups or run whatever yeah or something like that and it it you could tell that that's how like she was like you know like when you're in high school and they make you carry a football all day or like a baseball or like in my case the running baton if you drop it like it's like a it's like a discipline thing that is what happened with her you could tell that like if anyone said who you know who's they're pretty good who's the best and if she goes she would have to say i'm the best right and it was interesting because as it brings back to business and launching this stuff you have that same doubt granted you know you might lose money and get embarrassed thankfully you're not going to get your ass kicked or killed most likely but you still need that self-talk and that example that minute and a half clip is like the best example of self-talk for normal people do you do self-talk yourself yeah i yeah i definitely it's a trick question in a way because everybody has an internal monologue everybody's doing self-talk just in their head but i'm just more like do you strategically because a lot of people think this is like cheesy lame like affirmations uh you know in the mirror and say you're beautiful you're beautiful you're beautiful whatever no dude it's necessary because like so whenever you're doing anything yeah so like um whenever i'm launching anything or whenever i have fear like for example even when i bought my home i you know i don't i'm i have a i think i have a pretty unhealthy relationship with money i don't like spending it because i was poor i know what it's like to be broke and i was like no this is normal this is normal to feel this emotion this is incredibly normal do it anyway and then uh so yeah i i do that all the time but i try to normalize it i say this is normal this is what i i'm supposed to feel this way i am supposed to do it anyway so i tell myself that all the time is that what you do um i don't do that but i do i have two kind of routines that are like this that i've probably never told anybody about all right so um these are i would say this one is fairly new um i told you kind of like i had like this moment where i was like all right what do i care about i'm always been a self-improvement guy right i talk about tony robbins has been a big kind of like influence on me so i have this thing on my wall and it's basically what i wrote like like most people write goals like what they want to achieve what they want to have when i have a mansion or i want to hit this dollar amount i want to get promoted and for me i have a thing that's called i wrote on it who am i becoming and the way i do it is because i think about myself like uh every year is like a software update right what's version i'm 30 i just turned 33 what's version 33 of sean look like right and i i literally write this out beforehand i write out the like the notes like oh i used to have this bug where i got jealous about people that's fixed you know like um hey i added this new feature now i can play the guitar whatever right like i treat myself like a whole new version upgrade anyway so the all those little bug fixes and features they all add up to something what am i trying to become and um is that kind of like a root philosophy which is life is not about what you achieve or what you have it's about who you become and so i said all right well what do i want to become and i sort of wrote these four things out right i said i want to become a person who is uh who is fit through healthy habits i want to become a teacher um you know the favorite teacher of millions of people i want to be um you know a great family man who lives in a house full of love and i have like a last one right one more after that so anyways i have these four things that are like the things i want to become and i do this thing in the morning when i like do my kind of morning routine which is like my reminder for the day before i go and start just doing a bunch of work and a bunch of tasks and dealing with all the emails and [ __ ] that comes my way i just walk in a circle in my office which is a tiny tiny office i have like a i don't know eight by eight foot office and i just walk in a circle and every circle is i'm basically i'm basically talking like i'm you know talking to myself or my own coach about those about those four things so i'll say like you know um you know i'm becoming a teacher i am i am a teacher i'm a teacher who millions of people uh love what i love what i create they learn from me they're inspired by me i'm a teacher that means i gotta learn every day so i have something to teach i'm a great teacher right so i just say in the present tense i am this not i'm trying to become this um and then i'll say this the next one you know i'm a great dad you know uh even when things are going off the rails i'm patient that's when i get even more patient i'm poised i'm a great dad i'm always there for them they know i got their back i'm a great dad you sound like muhammad ali exactly you know i said i was the greatest before i am and so so i do that so i've been doing that now for like i don't know probably like a year um and i love it it's just kind of fun for me so that's the first kind of self-talk i do the second kind of self-talk i do is uh what i call revision which is i fall off the horse a lot like most people right like i'm i'm trying to eat healthy and then like [ __ ] in the middle of the day there's a bag of chips was there and i i ate the bag of chips or like you know i i say i'm gonna be a patient dad but then like uh like i've just lost it when you know she wouldn't let me change her diaper and then blah blah blah blah um so obviously i'm not perfect and so there so the other self-talk i do is revision at the end of the night i just imagine that same scenario that happened it only takes me 30 seconds i just think back to that moment that i'm not proud of and i reimagine it in a way that i'm me acting in a way that i'm proud of and that's it i don't like i don't like decide i'm going to do things differently i don't like write it down i don't like um pledge to myself i'll never do this again i just imagine it going the right way and then i just go to sleep and that act of reimagining things the way you want to see it is a form of self-talk in my mind uh it's just like rose saying i'm the best and imagining herself you know knocking out the other girl that's kind of what i do for you know i'm not a fighter i just do it in my day my daily life and the takeaway i think should be if someone's crazy enough to look up to you sean or look up to me then at least now they know that someone they look up to has like doubts and has to do that self-talk um the good the cool position that you and i are in is that we know people that are like some of them at least in terms of financial success which is a limited version of success are some of the most financially successful people in the world we talk to them and we know firsthand that they're like ugh i'm so depressed i can't do x y and z and then in our case like we look up to at least i do a lot of these ufc fighters and seeing like this tough last lady like doug rose doing the same thing so anyway this isn't hokey pokey this is actually everyone has this and it's interesting so look up that thug rhodes video that's badass um there's one other thing i'll put there which is um my trainer was big on this sort of like not to talk so much about the the visualization the imagination he's always like oh you're too analytical you're just being like you're trying to think your way through everything just imagine it just don't worry about how it's gonna happen think about what you want to have happen and in my head i was always like yeah yeah like at the end of the day somebody's got to figure out how it's going to happen that's going to have to be me so like just imagining it is not going to do it right so i was kind of resistant to it up front but i came around when i realized one thing which is everybody in their head is already imagining some outcome so like if you're ever stressed or worried or doubt what is that that's your head imagining the thing not going right not going well failure whatever right so if we are willing like it sounds kind of hokey and cheesy to imagine things going well it's like sort of like this hippy dippy thing to do but the other side which is imagining things not going well everybody's doing all day anyways anybody who's ever had stress or fear or doubts the if you just break down what that is that's imagining things not going well it's imagining a future where this doesn't work and so if you're willing to if you're already doing and willing to imagine things not going well you might as well start imagining things going well also and if you're already doubting have having doubts or impostor syndrome that's you doing self-talk in your head that you're not the best that you're not good enough that you're not whatever well then maybe you should replace that with something that says i am the best right so that's where i got over there like uh is this kind of just like you know cheesy voodoo [ __ ] and i was like well no because there is self-talking happening no matter what it's either going to be negative or it's going to be positive i might as well actively make it positive and if it is cheesy who gives a [ __ ] like if that gives me just a slight edge then then i'll take it because i need everything i can get um all right we should join then let's really quick before we get ready michael harris do you know who that is no who is that michael harris uh his name his nickname is michael lowe i don't know what leo's from but he founded death row records which uh he was the he was uh google it i i don't want to like get this totally wrong but i believe he was a cocaine dealer and he went to prison uh particularly uh i think it was san quentin for 25 years but prior to prison he uh made close to like 100 million dollars from selling cocaine and he funded death row records and he got it off the ground he's a co-founder of death row records owned the uh all the originals or the masters of everything anyway he's out of prison he's a good friend of uh my good friend chris it's he it's his good friend did you go pick him up when he got out well he he got he got he got picked up in a bentley which is pretty funny uh but anyway he wants to come on the pod you want him amazing yeah at death row who's death row so death row was tupac or death who was yeah so it was pock it was uh dre's early stuff um so yeah it was snoop so basically this whole like a lot of modern rap originated because of of death row records this whole like amazing you know [ __ ] the [ __ ] the police gangster [ __ ] they kind of like invented that okay great that's gonna be awesome all right uh you wanna talk about ufc again or do you wanna talk about something else let's talk about ufc but this time we're gonna talk about the business of ufc real quick so the parent company that owns the ufc is called endeavor and it never went public and go anytime something goes public you know you can go and you can sort of see the financials and you can read the prospectus because they have to do that in order to file for going public so this is the first time that the ufc's financials kind of like saw the light of day really um and they've been sort of shrouded by mystery uh you know fighters were always wanting to know the numbers because they want to get paid more they feel like they're super underpaid um you know dana kind of talks about numbers but like nobody could ever verify is that how many pay-per-view buys there were what not so i thought it's kind of interesting so i want to talk a little bit about endeavor and see what you think about this so yeah endeavor go ahead go ahead i'll just say the two guys who are like in charge of it i believe is ari emanuel and i think this guy patrick whitesell and ari is if you ever watch entourage the character ari gold is based off of our emanuel and so um he's kind of like a power player in uh in hollywood he you know they had their own talent agency um then that sort of took over wme and the dub and then they took so they have three parts of their business one is agencies like wme and and others so managing uh hollywood talent musical talent whatever then they have sports businesses where they own sports assets notably they bought the ufc but they also own some other things they own euro league basketball they own uh pbr like bull racing uh they own a bunch of like all writings well writing sorry um okay so so they own a couple of you know sports assets and then they have like kind of like a third um you know arm to the business which is their events business so they have the miss universe pageant they have new york fashion week they have uh they basically bought the company that hosts the event of the super bowl on location so they they have all these events and so they have these three arms of the business they also do publishing they do all types of [ __ ] like frankly how that company even operates i don't understand because there is some cohesiveness but there's also a lot of not cohesiveness and it's incredibly confusing really i think it's really like a roll-up of one theme which is sports and media entertainment so um so they roll in all these companies together and they have like yeah they have like a brand licensing thing where they have the brand for harvard and and the nfl and they'll go like license it out and give revenue back to harvard in the nfl so they went public it's worth 18 billion dollars uh now and uh yeah as as of right now it's 21.3 right so it went up just in the time of my research here i should have bought um they do about four to five billion dollars a year and specifically with the ufc i thought this was kind of interesting so i didn't know how much revenue the ufc does and i was a little bit surprised to learn that can i guess yeah i don't know if you've seen it or not no i haven't um i would say uh 800 in revenue 200 in profit all right very close we're very close on the revenue side so here's their so 700 million 875 million and then 900 million last year wow uh so very close on revenue but their margins are a lot better than you think so you were saying um 200 million two yeah so so their margins are about 36 percent uh so they have 30 ebitda um on their their product which is very good fighters only get 20 of revenue every other major sport nfl nba it's closer to 50 50. i think it is 50 50 split and so you know the fighters are sort of right when the when they say that they're under pain and um and so their business is interesting because they have media rights so uh guess how much the uh meteorites sold for so the the the uh it used to be on fox and now it moved to espn guess how much especially i think it was a billion over six years right um i don't know how many years it is but it's 300 million a year so i think it's actually more than a billion so they make so the fox deal i think it was 1.5 1.5 or five years i think wow so yeah so it's the fox deal was 168 million a year and then the espn deal was 300 million a year and that actually paid off pretty big because of their 900 million in revenue 300 comes from the meteorites the rest comes from merchandise events pay-per-view sorry ticket sales all that good stuff and um so i thought that was pretty interesting pretty good business overall much more profitable than i would have expected given you know all the different moving pieces that go into it and um and overall like kind of an incredible business because they bought the ufc for two million dollars like i don't know 20 something 25 years ago or something so they bought it they bought it out of it was going bankrupt and dana white who's the president of ufc convinced his two kind of childhood friends who were basically the the fertitta brothers are these like mafia family guys who own they own a casino so they own red rock casino and vape uh i think um fertitta's son he they are one of the fertitta kids or he's rh uh listens to the podcast i don't think he would like that if you said the air mafia public it's like uh it's like public it's like well-known information uh it's like been published everywhere and i also think by the way when i say mafia i'm not judging i think that's pretty [ __ ] cool and i think my people in the mafia also think being in the mafia is pretty cool so i hope they don't get offended by that and if they do um you know i live in austin you can go find me over there so yeah right so anyways uh the fertitta family is pretty interesting they started casinos they're the frank and lorenzo were the ones who dana convinced hey let's go buy the ufc so they bought it for two million and now and then they ended up selling it and when they bought it they pretty much just got the cage which was probably a 20 000 piece of equipment right and they got the name yes the ufc they were like we just loved that name it was such a great name and they go we paid 2 million but we didn't really get anything right but for some reason we did it they had to pour in way more money after that so it's kind of the the easy story is bought it for 2 million sold it for 5 billion which is obviously amazing but there was like multiple years of just pouring money in and losing money before this thing turned around because they couldn't get regulated in a bunch of places like john mccain called it human [ __ ] fighting and you know they couldn't they couldn't get licensed they couldn't um the business model wasn't there they wouldn't get put on tv that sort of thing and um so they pulled out used something yeah i was gonna say 65. they said in the documentary he was like we put a lot into it and it failed and failed and failed and by like year six they convinced spike tv which i don't even know that's a thing anymore to air the last fighter or the ultimate fighter yep and there was it was forrest griffin and i forget the other guy's name um and they had this big fight and i remember as a kid but yeah i remember that fight as a kid these guys were going at it they looked like it was the first time that like we thought wow they're like athletes they're not like these guys are they like they they're not necessarily like thugs or like meatheads like these guys are athletes who are fighting and i remember watching it and right when that episode aired their ratings went up and they go boom we just saved the whole company right from that one fight well the thing with that show is they show them in a house it's like a reality show right they're showing them living in a house and then training and then competing so it wasn't just a brutal fighting part it was like you got to know the guys you see their backstory you see them lying in their bed looking at a picture of their family right before their training session being like all right this is what i'm doing it for blah blah so people got emotionally invested so it's similar you know like the kardashians also like they use reality tv to build the brand that ends up being a commercial brand right because you perform an emotional connection of you know them and their sort of reality you know although it's quite edited um and then you know then you're more likely to be a buyer in the future so so yeah they ended up turning this thing around kind of an amazing outcome for them um just a super cool business and i would say if you don't follow the ufc there is one kind of like cool business lesson to learn from it which is dana white dana white is the most unorthodox president of a company that i think i've ever seen like people think elon is kind of like out there and he'll tweet random stuff he's kind of unafraid pretty bold dana makes elon you know look like a like a you know like an honor roll student um dana will like so he's been involved with the business from the from the beginning but he will go in the instagram comments where somebody's you know hating on something and he'll just be like go [ __ ] yourself you know like uh you know in the press conferences he is as much a character as any of the fighters and the same way that vince mcmahon did that in wwe but that's fake that's scripted dana does it in the unscripted format and i had an investor tell me once um we were talking about esports and you know a lot of people think esports is really interesting space because it's you know the viewership is really high but the business is kind of nascent still and people are wondering is there a ufc like opportunity there could you buy something today for 2 million that's going to end up being worth 45 billion and what this investor told me i think is so spot on you guys esports needs its dana white it needs its person who's gonna take this sport from like just the underground and brick by brick build it into a mainstream brand and like take no prisoners and like organize the whole [ __ ] thing along the way let me ask you this dana white when the deal when he sold the company he made 400 million dollars i think um i think that was public he owned four percent of the company um or i forget 10 he made 400. then he probably made like probably he was probably getting paid 10 million a year more than that 50 million at least that's michael before the sale before this oh sorry before the sale yeah yeah so he was wealthy ahead of time and he made money in a thousand who cares uh so let's just be like conservative and say that he's worth 600 to 700 million dollars that's conservative i think and like all the celebrities are one like they like like the the people who we think are cool they're the ones who think dana's cool like everyone thinks dave is cold you know what i mean like the famous people dana's famous to the famous people so he's got power he's got people want to uh people think he's cool yeah yeah he's got money would you trade spots with him no his lifestyle is brutal it's brutal absolutely never do that dude it looks horrible he looks like he's still like kind of looks fit but he looks exhausted his face is red and like he's gained like 150 pounds since starting this thing now it's kind of like muscle fat but because he takes steroids and stuff but um no he's dude he's on like they do an event every weekend basically and he has to like do like he has to manage headquarters plus he goes to the event he does the press conferences he's watching ringside then he goes and talks to the fighters afterwards and he deals with the weigh-ins and the oh this guy can't make it this guy got hurt we got to find a replacement he does that 52 weeks out of the year and like there's a reason that dana's not like you know happily married at home with kids and a great dad and you know unstressed there's a reason that dana's got bags under his eyes because he chose that life and he nailed it i would not choose that life it's not for me yeah yeah not a chance i i wouldn't either but but i respect the hell out of it i am happy what do i always say cornrows and and neck tattoos i'm happy they exist i don't want them um all right you want to do uh you want to go and try another one oh i didn't even see i didn't scroll down you had the revenue down here the whole time i never saw it yeah oh sorry did you want to wrap up with this or no no that's it i i just think it was kind of interesting i mean uh i don't really agree a major point on like oh good business bad business i think as somebody who's a fan of the sport the business side of it is just as interesting as uh as the actual sport itself yeah i think that like i think that ufc is mainstream popular now i can't exactly tell because the people who like it's my sport like that's like my it's my monday night football so i i follow it just as much as a hardcore football fan follows all that and i make my wife watch it with me now she is actually finally into it because she understands the story behind it because it's basically just wwe wrestling right it's just like it's like fake drama which i love so anyway uh we watched it and but i i think it's beyond just our crew now i think it's like mainstream almost like everyone knows who connor is so a couple episodes back we talked about business models that save you money and they just take a percentage of savings and how that's like the biggest no-brainer of all time we said taxes was good like income taxes we said um software savings car savings we said a bunch of stuff that was kind of an interesting episode i hung out with this guy who is uh he just lives a few doors down from me he started this company called student loan hero you know student loan hero never heard of it i i don't even know what it does it basically helps you consolidate debt i think so like if you have student debt you go to their website and you purchase some i i don't know i i haven't had a lot of time i think what it does is it i i've seen models like this i haven't looked up their website but i've common bond is another one of these they basically just refinance your debt at a lower rate so they save you money and then they basically make money because the new lender will pay them a fee for the for the loan they originated for them exactly um i just haven't had to do that so i i'm not exactly sure how it works anyway he sold that company bootstrapped it sold it for 60 million dollars his new company is called uh what's it called proper lot proper lot.com and his goal i went me and sarah went to his house the other day for breakfast and uh the guy just he like i took a picture of like my like just me in front of my house i don't remember what i was doing i posted it online he's like i don't want to be creepy or anything but i think i live like five doors down from you do you want to hang out uh and uh i went to his house and we hung out and he's got this new company called proper lot and they're doing this but with property taxes and what's there's a few interesting things about this the first thing is that he's trying to make this kisses theory where he thinks he can make it makes it he thinks he can make it relatively big like millions of dollars in revenue with him being the only employee so that's what he's doing that's interesting in itself how do they save you money on property taxes is there a simple explanation or no yeah so the second is the actual business so in where i now live in austin your property value goes up every year or every two years and then you're taxed two percent of your property value um because there's no income tax that's how they get their money so i bought my house for about one million dollars it's currently it went up crazy very oddly like it's like ah but it sucks for me that it went up like 20 in the first 60 days of owning it and now i owe two percent of like 1.2 million dollars a year in taxes so let's just say that that's 20 22 000 or something a year in taxes that i owe and what proper lot does is you tell them your address they look at the assessed value of your neighbors and they tell you to the government hey this actually isn't fair that you charged us 1.2 million our value actually should be 1.1 million and it all in all i it saves me about a thousand dollars a year and they take uh 300 of that fee and there's a few companies in the space but a lot of them are older uh like old school one's called uh i think it's called po the url is pocono.com uh they do about 100 million dollars a year in revenue with 200 people and then another one is called five stone which is local to austin they uh they filed 24 24 000 protests last year and made like four million dollars the way the company works is what the numbers are the average revenue per customer is about 50 to 300 and uh it usually saves customers two to five percent of uh an appraised value it lowers your appraised value by two to five percent um and they have a seventy percent success rate so for seventy percent of users who sign up they reduce you by two to five percent kind of an interesting business model and uh i i had i don't know if you had heard of it but i think it's great that's pretty cool i like that a lot um i wonder like you know how do they need your permission to do it so for example do you have to sign up as a customer and request it or can they just be like proactively doing it and then leave a flyer at your door hey we you know we did this for you would you like these this much savings well you know it's ready for you just claim your account like that would be a crazy growth hack if they could do it yeah no um you have to sign up but that actually would be a great marketing scheme gotcha okay uh cool i like this idea a lot did you have anything you wanted is there a riff of it uh no i just thought it was cool no i think that's cool the other day uh one of our listeners jordan told me that he was i listened to you guys just cause you tell me cool [ __ ] i've never heard of so yeah that was one of them okay speaking of i have a cool thing that i don't know if you've heard of have you heard the term no loss lotteries no okay so this is pretty cool so i met this guy leighton who uh is behind this thing called pool together so if you go to pool together.com you can see what it is what pull together is is it's a savings account uh and this is in the crypto world so it's just but but this exists everywhere uh it's a savings account where instead of just getting like you know if you go to a bank today you go get a savings account you're gonna get .00 whatever one percent interest it's like nothing right so what they said and said was well what if we pulled together everybody's 0.01 and then we give all that money away to one person as a lottery winnings so so it's a lottery where you don't have to buy tickets and you put nothing up at risk but you can win very very large and so this has existed the same model this prize-based savings is what it's called has existed you know for a while it's in the u.s it's very popular in the uk so there i think they call it premium bonds so in the uk there's something like 20 million people do this they they save in premium bonds and there's like a total of a hundred billion dollars saved in these prize-based saving accounts and the way they work is exactly how i described put your money in every week there's a drawing or every month there's a drawing something you know something like that and you can win like 25 bucks all ranging up to a million bucks and um and they they give it they give that out every every so often and so um so it's a pretty cool model it's a way to encourage people to save because right now the incentive to save is so small so the more savings you do the more like sort of tickets you have in the raffle so it's a pretty cool model now these guys supported this concept crypto and uh there's a thing in there in the doc check it out it's called usage numbers one great thing about crypto is that everything's on the blockchain so every app it's like you can see their google analytics um you know like it's all open so i can go see that these guys have [ __ ] they have 200 million in assets under management they have about 9 000 10 000 users uh like active users who participate in the thing which is a small number of users but for for crypto 10 000 active users just like you know you're one of the top uh like you know decentralized applications you know if you're doing that much like if you have that many users most of these are very very small but it's amazing how much money they have down there and it's and so the way that the thing works is they actually they give so let's say they have 200 million in uh in assets under management that means their lotto is going to be of x size you know i don't know exactly how much it is every week but it's pretty big and then what they do is they roll over some of those savings into the next week's jackpot so they they ensure that every week they always have uh you know a bigger and bigger jackpot by rolling over a percent of this of this week into the next so um you'll have to what can someone google to look at this because these stats like the growth rate is just like crazy yeah so so they could just if so the website i used to see how these uh crypto apps usages is called dune analytics so d-u-n-e analytics.com and then um and then you can basically we could put the whole url there but it's dude whatever pull together okay so i i i you i'm trying to get out of this like oh this is stupid when i have right here ethereum like i'm trying not to like even though i'm only like 30 i'm trying not to act like a grumpy old man whenever i hear the [ __ ] i'm trying so i'm gonna try and work hard to default to optimism here but my question to you is this when you see this stuff like when you're explaining me to this i'm like is this a gimmick or is this real um and i'm not gonna call it stupid um but when you're explaining this i think to myself is this a gimmick or is this like something that has longevity and can work i mean that's like all the all these crypto things like many of them there's no doubt they're cool but are they cool like the app yo is cool or are they cool like this is a thing that i could see lasting for 10 plus years so i think that this can last this one can last is that a fair assessment i think it's totally the right question to ask when it comes to crypto stuff versus like is there any value to this beyond speculation right that's always the first question with the crypto app and then it's like okay if there is value is this lastic value or is this a quick fad people are going to get tired of the gimmick and in this case what i think is interesting is that there's this whole like what's happening in crypto there's a whole parallel financial system being built so i have i have my wallet i have my real bank account and then i have my coinbase account right i have my my wallet in my pocket with credit cards in it and then i have my crypto wallet and i have my meta mask and i have whatever right and so i now have like two i now participate in two financial systems in the same way that like social networking split it up right i had my real life friends nearby in my neighborhood and whatever a school and then i had like my online friends and i had like my online way to go chat with people of which there's some overlap so the same things happen now with finance so what does that mean that means that there's a whole bunch of people out there millions of people who have who are participating in crypto and crypto keeps going up in price and now they have like substantial holdings and when you have substantial holdings you have two choices are you just gonna hold it and like earn nothing off of it are you gonna sell it so that you can cash some of it out or are you going to put it to work for you or you're going to reinvest it and what's happening is that all the people who who have won in the first couple waves of crypto now have those choices and they're all choosing to reinvest why would i sell i'm still i'm even more bullish on crypto right because i kind of believe before now i made a bunch of money well now i think this is the greatest thing ever um you know why would i sell i want to take a big tax hit for selling and be out of the game no i think there's still room to go up so they're not going to sell they're not going to hold and just do nothing with it because that seems kind of irresponsible too right let's say you have six figures seven figures eight figures worth of crypto why don't you earn five percent a year on that money you can through crypto lending products and things like that the point the point i'm trying to get to is when you have all this money people need something to do with it savings accounts is one lending is another reinvesting into other projects is another and so that's what you're going to see you're going to see all the all the existing use like financial infrastructure get rebuilt over here in crypto land and then some new [ __ ] that didn't exist in the real world that you can do in crypto land will get will get built so i think you know for that reason i think that if it works in the uk and 20 million people do it then i think there's a good shot that this is going to exist in crypt in the crypto world it's just so hard for me to understand would you do it like let's say you have like you have ethereum or whatever you have you have bitcoin would you put it in a savings account here and like potentially win the lottery one of these no-loss lotteries yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yes just to set it and forget it thing you don't have to like actively do anything once you decide that once yes i would do that and like to all the stuff that like i would call silly i would also do that stuff as well like when i buy an nft that costs a grand yeah but not more than a grand like right i went like to me it's like spending a grand on that it's just is the same fun as going to play blackjack for a grand like i can totally have a thousand dollars worth of fun over five hours right but yes i would use this okay i one other idea i want to throw through at you did you see this thing that was posted on wait but why the blog wait but why called uh when he's talked about his wife's startup no okay you should check this out so the guy who tim urban who writes weight but why posted this blog post and he says introducing the land beep and he got his wife yes have you seen that uh i was looking at it after you put it on this doc it looks awesome so you should go to his blog post i want you to go there for two reasons one is i think the idea is kind of interesting we can talk about that but the second is the way he tells the story and lays out the the case for this product uh for this startup is so good it's better than 99 of startup pitches you and i hear um because this guy's like a master storyteller and if you want to like think about how i should explain my startup or explain pitch my business go read this blog post all right i shout out everyone who subscribes to the podcast and sends me proof uh and if you send me proof uh you can send it to mfn at thehustle.com so that's like my first million mfm the hustle dot co send me proof so ready let's get to some shout outs and by the way everyone makes fun of me because i don't know how to pronounce or i can't pronounce stuff that well but i promise you i'm trying really hard so apologies also i'm like reading people's twitter handles and some of you guys have really silly handles so and i don't think many people could pronounce it so give a shout out to oh my god just this first one was challenging job hebraican um give a shout out to johnny jzv uh cunning underscore druger uh claude laudier hardly box dave falsky jack washburn lunatech fringe everest brady thad warren d munga roy brits jordan vanderhoff oh jordan vanderhoff i think i know that guy uh preston holland john hagerty tx8 down david piazza wade for wireless and the podcastition we'll do a couple more general comm uh kyle nydrick loft marcus a deal mytha and i think that's all oh my gosh am i just am i the worst these are really hard to pronounce am i right all right someone asked me to give a shout out to genuine uh genuinely interested podcasts that's what it's called generally interested podcast so shout out to them shout out says this guy is awesome everest brady has a power washing business called everest power washing dude if he's in austin i'm going to use them uh because i need that actually now um one rail app is a startup that we are changing logistics and supply chain and democratizing and amazon style logistics and delivery experience to retailers and distributors uh shout out to my youtube channel called one man startup this actually sounds pretty good check out one man startup um shout out to contemporary idiot it's a sub stack called contemporary idiot that's a pretty good name and then shout out to broccoli i think they say um they're big fans of broccoli and they wanted me to shut up broccoli all right if you want to give a if you want me to give you a shout out can you please subscribe to the podcast so go to spotify or itunes whatever you use click that blue button that says follow or that purple button on itunes that says subscribe click that take a screenshot and email it to me mfm the hustle dot co send me that please and i will give you a shout out talk soon i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back

are you aware of what it's like to talk to you um no i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like my days this is probably all right before i introduce our guest i'm going to butter them up a little bit i'm going to butter them up because i'm i'm genuinely excited for this i there's probably like three or four podcasts so far that i'm like oh yeah this is one that i wake up in the morning i'm excited to do i know that if we do a good job this is going to be one people's favorite podcast why is that well this is the best it's not morning it's going to be midnight soon where brayu is yeah we got up late or we stayed up late yeah but that's all right it's my birthday by the way today so this is how my wife was like what do you want to do for your birthday i was like don't worry it's already planned i'm doing a podcast i love it um so anyways the the reason i think this project podcast can be good this episode is going to be good is because our podcast is all about ideas people listen to this pod they wake up and they listen to this pod because we get the wheels turning we present new and interesting ideas or we talk about spaces or we talk about spaces in ways that you haven't heard too much before now one of those one of the ways that i get a bunch of my ideas is from our guest biology who is who is here and he has been i don't know what the exact quote was but i think mark andreasen at one point called you like the highest ideas per minute of anybody he's met is there do you know that quote that i'm talking about he he sort of yeah kind remark uh i he said they were useful ideas too which is good so um uh for our ideas people don't usually call them useful but that's okay entertaining is okay yes we teach people how to like launch like a porn app you teach people how to like you warn the world of a pandemic uh so like your your podcast is actually very popular and i've heard a lot of people say good things about it so don't be too hard on yourself it's good thank you thank you um and i think that you know one of the like if the a lot of people ask us like oh you know who do you guys follow who do you guys read you're one of my answers to if i started a new twitter account and i had to follow five people to like get that information flowing in who are the five kind of must follows i think you would definitely be in there for me and sam i know you've been following as well so we'll give kind of like a very quick rundown but then we have a bunch of topics that i think are exciting we're going to talk about a bunch of crypto things because i think you're uh very forward thinking in the crypto world we're going to talk about some non-crypto things um as well and then we'll all try to uh steer clear of too much controversy and you know let's let's play ball nobody get cancelled here we go so um so biology is here at one point you were you're a founder of i believe um a genetics company or a biogenetic company how would you describe your first company what was the kind of category you would call that one um clinical genomics so basically um you know one of the first companies to use genomics in medicine uh and basically we took if you've heard of tay sachs or sickle cell these sort of genetic diseases mendelian diseases that you probably learned about in high school those are simple genetic diseases where they can be predicted by usually just variation in one gene and um we did is we took all of those at the same time and test them at once with a universal genetic test and that was one of the first applications of genomics in the clinic where the scalability of it the fact that you could assess many different markers many different variants at the same time allowed you to cut costs relative to your traditional one one gene or one variant at a time blood test which i actually uh just used i used it my wife and i uh for freezing embryos um used you it's what's it called miriam yes women's health um you know division but basically it was it was called clu and syl council as an independent company um so like i i saw the packaging in the trash can and i was like oh wait i know this name and so yeah so sean that's what we used it for the classic cloud that could be of assistance um i think it's interesting because uh that's a space which has sort of just evolved in its own way um you know genomics and biomedicine it hasn't really linked up with the main body of tech um you know of like internet technology consumer technology it might do so this decade we'll see um hasn't yet it's sort of like how you know like high frequency trading and all the type of stuff is its own kind of sub area and crypto has now linked it up with the main body of tech you know where it's programming uh you know programming on top of blockchains right um now that we have under 30 million sequence genomes and lots of people with genotypes i forget the latest number but both 23andme ancestry.com there's millions of people who have personal genomes uh albeit genotypes rather than full sequences i think we're going to start to see more kind of you know computations a lot of genomes have been installed in the same sense like a personal computer's install it's a piece of software right or data rather locally on your computer that you can do things with that's a whole separate topic happy to dive into that if you're interested and what and what did you do after that um so i was and that was like a sorry actually that was like a 300 million dollar exit or something yeah yeah well like like pretty wildly successful it was good it was good yeah it was a good company and um i think you know so after that there's a bunch of things um i was an early investor in cryptocurrencies so bitcoin ethereum um zcash a bunch of other ones you've heard of i shouldn't say every major coin but every major coin that i think has some technological innovation you know i've probably got like something in it not every single one but a lot of them um early investor in superhuman soylent cameo lambda school replit uh mighty a bunch of others have all done fairly well um you know a deal if you just saw this became a unicorn or whatever last week all things that sort of i think fit my philosophy um because you know i sort of invest in invest in things that help to improve quality of life in the future that i envision and so you know uh some somebody mike with um crypto for example crypto is built for the apocalypse but with internet right you know soylent you know that type of stuff right and you know there's an apocalypse and there's a rebirth after that and so i kind of think of that is sort of this stack of technologies you can kind of view it from that lens of the unbundling and fracturing of all 20th century all pre-internet institutions and then the rebundling of them back together into new internet native forms i think very few institutions that predated the internet will survive the internet in the fullness of time so i want to ask you oh sorry go ahead i think i think sean that um before we like really get into it though i did want to call out i think uh we want to call his latest project right because i want we might talk for a little bit i want to i want to be able to promote that right away as opposed to in the end so you want to well sean you want to take it from there yeah well i'll let you introduce it but uh super interesting project i believe the url is 1729.com so just the numbers 17 1729.com and it's really simple and i love simple simple idea which is it's a newsletter that pays you so it's a newsletter that you get that has these little micro tests so i got one i don't know it was yesterday the day before it was basically like you can get 3 000 bucks in bitcoin if you create memes that will promote you know crypto and india or you know help help package that idea in a way that's shareable and spreadable that's what memes are um around crypto and india and so there are these little tasks that come out and so it's a newsletter that you read not just for like sam's got a newsletter 2 million subscribers the hustle they give information but it's sort of like a pat it's like you know you just consume it and you move on with your day your newsletter is actually kind of interesting because it gives you an opportunity a small bite-sized opportunity for you to do a thing and build up not only not only earn from it but also build up in a way as you do more and more of these build up some credentials by having accomplished these little micro tasks so can you give us the like that's right know that's my reason for the outside did you hear that slight he goes yours is actually interesting we should do a collaboration with i'm sure actually there's a lot with the hustles kind of ethos that i think overlaps um you know as i was mentioning to sean beforehand you know you guys like it takes all different kinds to build a company and you guys have sort of the sales you know business dna natively right and for me that's very much an acquired tongue you know where like i i can emulate you know business and i can i can run that in an emulation layer but like my core os is math you know and then there's folks who are like the reverse who are fundamentally businessmen and who can get into the tech and get into the computer science and so on as sort of a way to do business and you know one needs both kinds right um but i think one area of overlap potentially with the hustle you know sort of audience is uh that you know a lot of time online as we know is just being wasted right it's being thrown into a meat grinder i mean like the sheer number of hours when we really think about the millions or billions of hours that are used on social networks um look i think there's a necessary step to get people online i think like on balance it was necessary but i think one issue is that social networks were invented and scaled 10 years seven years issued before cryptocurrency and so because of that uh you could only transfer status online and not value and what that means is that everything basically boils down to status games leaderboard what's the most popular how many followers how many faves etc and those appear locally non-zero sum but are globally zero sum that's to say locally it appears it cost me nothing to give this person a like but globally it's a zero-sum leaderboard only one can be at the top right and that leads to the status games that you see on twitter and all these other places that are somewhat ameliorated in places like reddit where they use pseudonyms but it's an issue anyway what's my point so 1729 uh you know my friend dan romero actually a while back was tweeting like you know what's the new hacker news and i think you guys were were talking about that um and i think the new hacker news for crypto is not just a place where you come to discuss and do things aimlessly but something which uses crypto so that you can actually earn and learn you know and actually the third is burn so we actually have another thing proof of work out right so basically you're pursuing you know truth health and wealth in that order and i think that's actually the right priority order right so learn truth you know determine what's true pursue health you know because without that you have really nothing else and then wealth is important but it's third and it's important to have that third you never want to do something that's untrue to make money or you know to to sacrifice your long-term health for wealth i mean whatever losing sleep one day okay maybe not the end of the world for a year it's gonna affect your long-term health you know and that's actually going to affect even from a pure dollars and census it's going to affect your wealth entering capacity and your capacity to provide value for your employees and your shareholders even if you if it's the selfless thing to do on a daily basis on a long-term basis you want to take care of your health for the health of those around you so essentially this was sort of so that this true health and wealth thing is this like a personal saying or is this like the the is this like the slogan for 17 29 years for 1729 it's basically i think of as the new liberte egalite fraternity okay uh that's great i know it sounds ambitious but basically um as a tripartite motto for a new kind of state in the in the fullness of time um and uh the reason is that um technology actually allows us to do all three you know with crypto in particular with decentralized ledgers we can can i ask the question in a slightly different way which is whenever i'm looking at an investment i think i asked the founders this my favorite question to ask the founder is awesome what is the world let's fast forward three years what does the world look like if this has been adopted what is my what does my day look like that's different maybe me as a user but i would love to hear your version of that because i think there is a really different and a cool new lane that gets opened up as something like this gets more adopted so what does the world look like if this uh what does my date look like what does it look like well first is um rather than just accumulating karma you're actually accumulating something of value right so something a tradable asset um you're earning cryptocurrency you're you're you're actually leveling up yourself imagine if you didn't just gain i don't know 100 thousand followers but hundred thousand dollars in all your posting online right that would actually give material benefit to people right now you know for technical reasons facebook and twitter basically capture all the revenue and in the early 2000s mid-2000s that was actually a great deal because they were giving these free platforms that you could broadcast to anybody in the world um and they would maintain everything for you they give all the hosting you know the free model was actually a very good deal relative to the alternative at that time and so they just take the cut for doing it but now today people realize actually hey all this content that i'm producing for them all this work that i'm putting into it the hours into your tweets or whatever um you aren't seeing a single dime out of it there's zero creator modernization for the most part in these major social networks um i'm not saying okay not totally zero you could put link in bio at instagram and there's some stuff but it has lagged right and um so now we need a kind of a new social contract a social smart contract and what that means is basically to make money online and not just make money but to learn things online and not just to make money and learn but also become healthy and so if this becomes popular you don't waste time online or not just waste time you learn things um you actually gain crypto credentials not just cryptocurrencies so like badges in your wallet which are emblematic or reflective of your ability to do certain things for example you complete five python problems and you get a badge that says i've completed five python problems and you complete you know 10 questions on i don't know russian history and you get that kind of badge right or the russian language now why that kind of thing is important is it totally destroys the concept of a college diploma the reason being college diploma is a very very coarse-grained um you know kind of illustration of somebody's skills if somebody says oh i've got a harvard degree or stanford degree right what does that really mean you know you have some estimate okay i kind of know that they you know stanford degree in computer science i kind of know what the curriculum is but this particular person you don't know what their skills are actually all their coursework they did during undergrad has been basically wasted right and if instead what you did was that portfolio that they had every single problem that they sold was in a folder on github so you know they have 25 courses in 10 10 weeks per course and 10 problems per course all 2500 problems were organized in folders on on github you could see their portfolio you could drill down and see their particular skills okay this guy knows operating systems she knows compilers um this person knows machine learning and i can see that as evidenced by the 15 problems they've solved with source code online and especially for a broad discipline like computer science or electrical engineering or chemical engineering you can't simply presume that because somebody has a degree that they have that particular skill set people have strengths in different areas point is once you unbundle that or you granularize that once you give individual measurable skills you can see just how much talent you know or background somebody has in there oh this person has solved a hundred different problems on compilers uh they're actually really an expert in this area and i've got the badges to prove it okay once those badges are in your crypto wallet just like you log into a website today and you can load in your cryptocurrency or unload it right i think one of the things we want to do at safety trying is have this sort of portable crypto diploma or these crypto credentials so you could log into a job board and just start working because you're automatically qualified on the base of your credentials right right now the only thing we can declare is our interest right i'm interested in game of thrones you can't provably declare i know how to calculate eigenvalues right i know arnoldii langsos you know i know you know methods for large matrices i know how to do graph layout that type of stuff right you can't credibly declare that you can certainly put the words in your cv but if you guys have hired you know that that's an unreliable narrator problem often right you know people will say so how does that similar question but basically like what i'm understanding with this is like so right now as it is it's a much simpler it's not doing everything you just said it's basically um here's a here's something that is just like silly funny or actually useful i'm gonna pay you money if you could pull it off that's right um and that's in itself that's just like interesting and fun and neat but the long-term plan here is that basically you're going to have let's say you're building a company anyone who meets the requirements are you saying they're going to be able to log in based off of their task history and just contribute workers and get paid for it exactly now that sounds like my thing with you is like everything you sound is crazy but you you're right a fair bit so it's like it's like it's so i have to like i'd like life would be easier because it's ridiculous if we could just write you off as crazy we could just move on with our day damn it the guy's right so now we have to take each one of these ideas and actually say [ __ ] so this is actually so so let me let me speak to a few points here right so basically like the very short version is 70 trying is a place where you make money learn things level up with technological progressives interested in building a positive future right so it's it you know on the east coast for example media media businesses have sort of software engineers as second classes right they're just guys who build the app and the writers are kind of the first class right um traditionally in tech it's been the opposite you know the software engineers are the you have private place they're building dropbox or google or whatever and then the writers are content marketing i think here another aspect of safety giant is they're kind of unified where we have a product roadmap and we also have content calendar and those are really you know side by side and basically equal pairs we have a story that we're telling as we're kind of building this functionality and i think one of the things about this and there's several different angles i can talk about but one big thing is uh this is a sort of reaction against what i think of as the entropic internet right so if you know entropy or the concept of entropy it's like particles flying in every direction okay if you go and look at hacker news for example or twitter there's something that you can't unsee once it's been pointed out which is those 30 links are like a jackson pollock blah on on on the on the page right it's just it's like guaranteed to just fragment your brain into a thousand pieces right um and the opposite of that is something like you know what michael nielsen has been doing with the science of reminding you know where you learn something and you don't just learn it you get you know reminders at you know one minute and one hour and one day you know space repetition right of the same concept with a little bit of space repetition it gets stored in like your permanent memory banks you remember quantum computing for example right so right now what we're doing with the entropic internet is for just eating all this junk food which feels good because it's novelty seeking oh cool that's cool oh that's cool oh that's cool right and you know if you have a really good memory then you don't need the space repetition but most people don't have such a good memory and even people who have a great memory i mean do you remember the thousands of links that you've seen online no it's actually more like watching a movie it's just it's just sugar it's just candy right if instead you can be much more deliberate about a less entropic internet and essentially a goal for yourself and you make one high level decision come to 7029 and then what we do is we basically serve you content that strengthens you right sean i i i think that we can take this in so many ways i want to talk about media eventually but where do this is so interesting what he's like you you want to yeah like she just threw out this like meaty thing and we could like chop this up in like a hundred different ways there's so like i want to talk about this anonymous work thing which is somewhat like this i want to talk about this topic and i want to talk about what you just said about east coast media i would love to talk about that sure what do you want to do so let's just jump around because i think that's if this was let's do it like we always do if this was just us hanging out having a conversation and the listeners are flies on the wall uh that's what people like best so let's do that so uh yeah what would you say right now if it's a normal conversation you'd be like tell me what the you know let's talk about media i want to go to this media thing because you said something that i see that you're doing and i think it's smart but it's so obvious i don't know why you and others haven't done it which is i do the same thing i criticize like east coast media where like the writers are the stars and a lot of them are it's like the circle jerk community um that i am somewhat part of i owned a media company and i've hired a lot of those people and in silicon valley the engineers are like the gods where and both are circle jerk communities like they both can stink and they both can rock whatever so um but you're saying that you're paying attention to content now in media i was talking with you i don't know did we do a call we did something something where i was teaching where i was teaching you about email because you're like this email thing is cool and i was like duh dude what the hell well i i i remember we had a call and i remember you had actually some insight i don't think it was quite like oh my god no i i'm teasing you you you i i criticized your website i go dude if you want email to be part of your website just make your website like your personal domain like just make that an email and that's it got it yay i understand i understand so the thing is that um i was actually building 1729 at the time but your suggestion of actually having the subscriber thing on the front page like subscribe is actually what we did do so we did take that suggestion and i think it's good um so but but what i'm getting at though is like why are you all of a sudden caring about media and and i and the reason why i'm asking this is i love media i love content so does sean it's a pretty shitty business model like subscribe subscription's a good business model advertising is a shitty business model but another way of putting it another way of putting the question is you built a you know a bio you know genetic genetics company you uh you know we're cto of coinbase early in crypto and the current product in its product form is a newsletter right low tech but you know high reach you know potentially so why did you decide to do that of you know why did you decide to go kind of go into a space where uh you know we debate this all the time you know is media a good space to go into why um so i think sam is that what you're getting at like why did you decide to launch this product which you say you want to know and i want to know what your version of media is going to be and like because i don't ever want to leave this industry but i think the business model blows so like if you have if you can save me i would love that well okay so lots of lots of things there so one is that um i think let me give it let me give a story a history and yeah then maybe go from there so um you know you can you can date let's say the modern era of tech different starting points well let's date it starting at like 1995 with the netscape ipo okay um and you know from 95 to roughly 2008 um you know tech and media basically ignored each other or rather media coverage of tech was was positive you know up until the dot-com boom and after the dot-com crash and 9-11 for many years there in the early 2000s um you know tech was happening but it certainly was not a front page story it's actually hard to remember but you know if you go back to even 2008 and you look at like lists of power centers of the us silicon valley doesn't actually come up there because google was just a search engine facebook was just a college social network you know it was growing but it was just college social network and uh the iphone hadn't yet come out it was just coming out 2007 was announced right and um so the so so media kind of ignored tech during this period is occupied with the iraq war and you know terrorism and all this stuff that was a big storyline of the the 2000s uh and it was you know obviously there were blogs and stuff like that and people were using it but it was kind of a there's a sideshows like that thing you kind of you know supporting character basically um tech also ignored media and that that reason is different that's because terry simmel was at yahoo and he tried to turn yahoo into a media company and for an entire generation of tech founders uh that that seemed like a very bad model because you know yahoo failed or i shouldn't say fail fail didn't go to zero of course but relative to google it failed and all these this entire generation of tech founders took the lesson that you just built a pipe right you built facebook yeah aol did it too yeah exactly that's right so facebook dropbox you know um you know youtube twitter that entire generation of companies basically said we're neutral pipe we're just going to build a technology by the way that was hard enough that was pretty freaking hard you know like at that time bandwidth constrained environment before all the modern web development tools that was actually not trivial you know so they just focused on that completely and they said look the users bring their own content user-generated content right and um that kind of you know happened for a while and then the financial crisis happened and the iphone happened and after the financial crisis in you know 2008 from 2008 to 2012 facebook google apple all started going totally vertical and there's a graph called print media disruption which you can see which was after the financial crisis you might you know i showed that on screen if there's like a video version of this after the financial crisis print media dropped the revenue from like something like 65 billion down to like 17 billion while google and facebook were just going vertical like this right and craigslist of course was also a factor here it wasn't just you know like like advertising was also classified that was a major factor craig newmark effectively bought them off with uh the numark foundation stuff with a lot of grants for journalism like datajournalism.com this sort of uh there's like a surveillance handbook at datajournalism.com by the way exactly how to surveil a subject of an article uh which you can look at to see exactly how these folks kind of think um but we uh when we started the hustle by the way we started it out of craigslist office there are a bunch of stories in the 2000s there were negative pieces on craigslist it wasn't obvious to me whether or not the craigslist classifieds were actually that much worse than newspaper classifieds i never saw any stats on it but it seemed motivated in part by you know craigslist economic you know attacks on on media implicit not not intentional but implicit i think in part some degree of peace was bought with craig then funding a bunch of journalism i have nothing against craig you know i don't know him i'm just saying that i that's that's an observation uh craigslist by the way is a wildly profitable business it's just private so nobody knows how much money it makes but it's it's a very big deal okay what's my point coming back up the stack so from 2008 to 2012 tech suddenly came out of its box which was you know oh cute gadget manufacturers over there in palo alto just take over all of these segments that were previously the east coast segments like madison avenue was taking a hit everybody was looking to cut costs after the 2008 crisis entertainment okay let's do that online rather than going to the movies all of that type of stuff just shifted online it's a huge digital shock right a corona is a second one by the way um and so what happened is that you know tech and media were basically allied through 2012 to get obama reelected um and if you look at the late 2012 coverage for example like the nerds go marching in december 2012 was sort of the high water mark of sort of the tech media alliance and then in 2013 basically the post-election the knives came out right um and uh essentially what happened was media was like okay uh you guys um are getting way too big for your britches uh we kind of thought of you as like just a part of the coalition but you're coming for the entire enchilada you know to mix metaphors right uh and um this was something where all the negative articles on tech and tech bros you can date it exactly to like 2013 2012 um there's even articles at uh you know valuebag whatever denying that such a thing as a programmer exists okay um the same guy the next year is starting to write you know nasty articles on like tech bros and and whatnot right so it's a very crisp shift okay and um so so then what happened basically for the next several years tech got its head caved in by by media with the tech lash something i warned against because i could see it as like a almost like a seed investor i could see this thing brewing and going viral in in 2013 and i could see even you know there's one journal in slate who's like sort of sort of denounced this thing and said oh you know would you look at all these rich people this is such a silly view of the world you know we can do so much more and then five years later he's calling for abolish billionaires right you can actually see the radicalization pipeline of these folks in real time and um you know you can you can watch this happening because their world is collapsing and they blame it on tech and it is certainly true that economically a lot of that revenue is going to tech tech didn't try to do it but google and facebook and twitter took away ads but not just ads they also took away a lot of influence and so you had this sort of battle of the bulge style reaction you know in from roughly 2013 to 2019 with this tech lash and these media corporations they couldn't build search engines or create social networks what they could do is write stories and shape narratives and do you know the difference between like a story and you know a product announcement well i mean one's objective one isn't it yeah but a story has a bad guy i got a hero so go ahead i said and a hero yeah yeah yeah but but like you know as people have said you can build a religion without god but not without satan um and you know so the um not original to me you know that's that's a saying uh and so what happened basically was you know while tech is busy doing these pastel colored product announcements oh you know like dropbox offers 10 more gigs yay and it's just a utility right um media corporations were busy lining up to paint tech as bad as evil and you've heard like 500 different lines of argument on this right and every you know uh like gernon academic was jostling to try to find that meme that would like kill these tech companies once and for all right and uh you know they've been somewhat successful in that and but they also haven't been um what's happened is a lot of the older lion tech companies that didn't have any ideological defenses but were good at making money got sort of mentally colonized right and you know went woke and um that has resulted in you know yeah they could make a lot of money but they didn't have the the meta level story they didn't have the middle level narrative so it's like that saying about uh economists right practical men who believe themselves fully devoid of external influence are often the slaves of some dead economist have you ever heard that you know that's by john john maynard keynes i think um so his point being that these ideas float around the air and people are running on scripts that they don't even realize they're running on because media scripts humans just as code scripts machines right this is something i had in the ferris podcast right so technically unpack that for a second for somebody who doesn't get it right off the top you know you know just the way that you know uh what is a script in the way that the media scripts humans um masks work masks don't work um okay boomer um every meme right for example okay you see a bunch of kids when they're the k the karen thing yeah the karen thing you know you see a bunch of kids when they come out of a movie theater what is the first thing they do i haven't seen kids come out of a movie theater i don't know okay a bunch of kids coming here the first thing they do is they start quoting lines from the movie right they just reenact what they just saw on screen right right and so you know this is something where the way to get people to do something sometimes it is to tell them to do it but often is just show it being done right and that is kind of you know peter thiel's you know a citation of rene gerard on mimesis i think is important like humans are memetic that's how we acquire language that's how we align on objectives you know and i think that um whether you want to call it contagious mental illness i think that's an understudied concept by the way we know that there's contagious physical illnesses we know there's viruses right uh contagious mental illness well we've sort of all stuck our brains into twitter right like this vat right imagine putting your brain into a vat with 300 million other people and they're all just sending electromagnetic you know their brain states to you it feels a little unhygienic if you think about it that way right um and in an interesting sense we sort of social distance away from each other offline but we packed close online like social networking packed clothes and what that meant was that bad means you know crazy memes could spread faster than ever wildfire whoosh like this right because everybody's brain was connected over his brain right there's you know there's a famous uh cartoon of this um you know with the with the stock market where it shows the medic contagion with respect to prices you know and it's like uh a guy says okay i can't have any more of this goodbye and someone overhears and they're like goodbye bye bye bye bye bye you know like uh and then and then there's somebody else who overhears it and it's like um i think the stock could really excel and then someone's like excel sell sell sell sell and it's actually really funny right because um you know it just sort of conveys these sort of like traveling waves of of memes right right now we don't have great visuals on this we can't uh we can't do the molecular neurology of the meme like we can do the molecular biology of the gene uh let me explain what i mean by that the concept of genetics uh predated molecular genetics you know like mendel went into these phenomenological experiments where you could see you know like the the pea plants and so on big a little layer if you remember that from high school or what have you before people understood the biochemistry of you know deoxyribonucleic acid and how a gene is actually represented in the double helix and all that type of stuff that awaited kind of the next century right in the same way i think dawkins and kind of our phenomenological understanding of memes right is something that is ahead of our molecular neurology how are ideas represented in the brain right how are they stored how are they retrieved how are they accessed how they communicate people have done things on this with like you know the so-called jennifer aniston neuron right where you know it appears there's actually sites in the brain that would actually store jennifer aniston like you see something and it just has you know where you see the words jennifer aniston you see the image jennifer anderson you see a video of her you see brad pitt and it would light up next to her and so on and so forth for somebody who follows all this celeb stuff it's not my thing but um this is from that uh it's from paper a while ago when jennifer anderson was still i think very much in the news not as much today right um that concept seems to also exist to some extent within neural networks um you know like the new you know like the the the ai stuff that's being done where you can actually seem to um express uh like a like an abstract concept where a neuron replacer i think open ai i forget who i think is opening i had a paper on this recently okay so we're starting to actually get at how concepts abstract concepts could be represented in a quantifiable scientific way and you know we're not yet there but eventually we'll be able to see things like okay here's this traveling wave of ideas memetic contagion here are ideas that serve as vaccines against those other ideas right they block them out because these ideas are themselves trying to spread so yeah so how does this so like i'm going to say like here's the the the dumb sam version of what you said which is like i can convince people to believe certain things by making them feel certain emotions and i could do that by by using sticky viral content which boils down to funny memes um and that the internet is still on tap and then we can all we're all racing to stake put our stake in the ground and email is one great empire to build is that kind of what you're getting at well email is one piece of it right um but yeah but basically you know there's push notifications that's just a mechanism of how nodes are connected but they on a side note on that i do think that within five to ten years in addition to email and text message your um ens name will become probably the ensdam real estate crypto name will become the third most popular communications channel um well i want to talk about that in a second because that's amazing but to wrap up the media thing so to what what did sean say earlier he was a he had a good question which was like in three years what's the world going to look like what's your let's say that you are running which you kind of are um this small media business maybe one day it will be a media empire what do you think that's going to look like um and like how's that going to function how's that business model going to work totally yeah so um basically i think uh so you know i'm giving long answers because i didn't have the time to write short ones i don't know if that makes any you know if you've heard that one yes yeah yeah it's uh uh i didn't have time to write a short thing i was too busy doing the long term so so excuse my digression and you know maybe i can edit this down into sound bytes or or shorter thesis statements the short version is basically tech ignored media for all the reasons i just described in that story and over the last six years we've seen the cost of ignoring media the story is told and you're the bad guy okay now um there's another story to be told which is uh for example there's a website called tech journalism tech.com okay um so a nigerian guy basically tried to submit this as an op-ed to a bunch of uh tech journalism outlets and couldn't get it there and i put up a prize and he actually went and did this analysis and shows that actually tech is like 30 points more diverse in the media outlets that constantly give tech [ __ ] about this right um and so the um you know another story is that actually a lot of the owners of these media corporations are like literally inherited wealth like nepotists that right you know just got the family business from their father's father's father's father and uh you know you know another aspect is they're mostly american as opposed to the mostly immigrant nature of tech which is very global and has an international purview and so on and so forth there's actually a number of ways where uh the narrative of these media corporations where they run billboards that literally they market themselves as truth on a billboard or democracy like democracy dies in darkness like that's how they market themselves on a billboard or or fairness and balance right that's just corporate propaganda literally by these legacy media corporations to define themselves as the literal truth you know and they believe this you know the brains have been melted by corporate propaganda to such an extent now i don't think any tech company would be you know people talk about tech arrogance or i think any tech company would be so crazy as to market itself as a little truth but now actually we have an answer as to what that literal truth is which is cryptography cryptography and especially how the blockchain actually puts it online is decentralized truth right it's mathematical truth it's truth that anybody has access to um you know as i mentioned in a previous podcast basically everybody knows exactly how much bitcoin somebody has you know whether you're palestinian or israeli democrat or republican that's not something there's actually contention over which is amazing because it's this trillion dollar piece of international property that's the kind of thing people usually fight over we can use those so what are you implying peop we're going to be we're going to be covering that we're going to be covering these transactions and we're going to know well is that i mean here's what i think yeah here's what i'm playing here that's only one that's only one niche that's an interesting one yeah yeah okay so step two is defy where it's not just who owns what bitcoin but who owns what digital property digital goods and that's an enormous swath of the economy right maybe most of the economy over time all property eventually becomes digital should i clarify why i think that because that's that's a provocative statement why does all property become digital because much of the physical world becomes printing okay so obviously you can print out a piece of paper right um if you look at for example the supply chain or what's going on in robotics in terms of um like getting food to your door okay there's folks who uh will obviously the restaurant is now pop-up right uh the delivery you know bit there's folks who are doing autonomous cars right or sidewalk delivery robots which are better in some ways there's folks who are doing autonomous food prep right and so you could imagine the whole thing being fully automated and it's all of robotics and it's all this electromechanical process that has no human intervention in which case it's analogous to just a print right it's like printing something out and i think like robotics is something which has sort of again sort of have been happening in our peripheral vision we kind of know what's going on boston dynamics and whatnot but what i think is going to happen is most the value will be created online and you'll print it out by essentially invoking robotics and i think that's the next you know this decade we're going to see more and more of that you're starting to see actually robots in the field like these robot dogs i think we're going to see way more of that and it's going to come pretty quickly because once a robot can do something you've turned labor into capital because it's all electricity and the value you create and say i'm sorry i'm installing that premise okay all property becomes digital so that's the second phase right you know who owns what bitcoin and then you know who owns what loans bonds stocks assets all the type of stuff okay but the third phase is most interesting to me and with that is it's related to something called crypto oracles so many of these contracts over here in the second phase you're doing bets on um you know will this price go up or down or more interestingly uh will the temperature go up um in you know this uh this this farmland so i need to pay out this insurance because there's a drought okay that's like an example of a smart contract which combines a financial aspect and a fact about the world right for something like that to happen that was kind of similar to the business model of like the climate corporation like climate.com if you remember that right for something like that to work the smart contract needs access to data about the outside world which is not purely financial okay and uh that's the crypto oracle problem where basically oracle's broadcast data on chain and they sign it and they say i'm reporting that this is true i the weather channel i'm saying that it's 82 degrees in pokey today at this time right and i give a timestamp like temperature feed and this is happening not just for temperature but it's happening for um you know crime statistics or not just individual crimes from which statistics are calculated it's happening for medical records right so a hospital wouldn't just say we have a thousand chronovirus patients it actually has a feed of this patient at this time this patient at that time um redfin or zillow doesn't just publish aggregate stats it actually has a feed of which real estate transactions are happening at what time okay and from this accurate stats can be computed but you can also drill down to individual rows and diligence them what's the point right now all of these feeds of data that i'm describing are siloed you know the the real estate data happens here the medical data happens here the price data happens here the temperature data happens here but what i call the ledger of record is essentially the integration of all these crypto oracles and the reason they go on chain is that it's profitable you can trade off of that information right you can make money off of that information so each individual oracle goes on chain and it's subsidized so you've got a micro incentive to put it online that's not some macro you know high floating you know concept but the macro concept is as all of those individual oracles go into this thing i call the ledger record you now have cryptographically verifiable facts about the world you have a digital history an unalterable history you can tell what happened when and in a sense this is kind of just the next step in the sense that we've got all these tweets right which actually give us a reasonable i shouldn't say perfect but some degree of the intellectual history of you know the last decade right uh if the twitter database was downloadable and eventually you know either something like it either it will be or someone will scrape it or something like that because you know storage just keeps improving so you can store all of twitter on a micro drive of 2035 or something like that that database could be analyzed in all kinds of ways to determine people's moods what people talked about all the memetic contagion stuff that we just talked about you could actually look at all of that and visualize that we can't easily see that right now because the data set isn't open in the future with this ledger of record it would be and you'd be able to establish what happened at what time and so that is the sense sam in which you go simply from just who owns what bitcoin to who owns what smart contracts to who said what thing at what time like what facts were asserted and that is actually a very powerful thing where we start to actually displace a corporate media corporation as the font of truth with cryptography instead all right let me pause there i know it's a whole download but maybe i can express it better i'm going to summarize some of the some of the interesting ideas that you brought up so i think uh and you could take drink of water you deserve it um so so i think one of the interesting things was the kind of observation of me first media ignoring tech and then sort of as tech became more powerful ignoring media and what you're identifying is that technology companies are going to realize the power of media meaning being able to shape the narrative rather than just being the villain in the narrative continue this is the third swing of the pendulum that's one interesting trend if you're building a company right now that's very much worth considering uh yeah and in order to do that you're gonna have to flex different muscles uh storytelling memes packaging you know different things you don't have to do once i give you my meme i mean own a media corporation or be owned by one there you go uh and so so that's that's one interesting kind of point you brought up second one is this idea of empirical truths enforced by economics so today uh media companies claim to be the truth they market themselves as the truth it was just you know sort of the corporate propaganda and there's all kinds of hypocrisy underneath that so uh you identified many of them the let's say criticizing diversity yes not being diversity not being diverse yourself uh criticizing you know hating billionaires yet the media companies owned by billionaire families that are passing it down from one child to you know one father to the next son so there's all these hypocrisy underneath that uh and how do you get away from that while there is this general movement of all things becoming digital it's not just software it's the world sort of uh you know the whole world becomes software and as the whole world becomes becomes digital assets become digital contracts become digital data and news reporting becomes digital and you have this idea of crypto oracles which are the journalists or media companies of the future where if we need to know what happened what is the truth who won the game who got elected you know in order to enforce these betting markets or these prediction markets or these stock markets um then you then they will be rewarded through these sort of micro economic incentives for being accurate or punished very able summary but let me offer a few asterisks so i think the vision of the future is oracles and advocates right so redefine a reporter as like a sensor right a sensor that essentially writes data on chain okay which can literally be um like like a machine that just takes a temperature sense and writes it on chain right and the thing is you might think that's trivial but hey that would actually in aggregate if you had lots of them give you a cryptographically provable record that you could use in for example discussions about climate change right so the weatherman becomes a sensor who tells the weather that's right that's right or but this but this this is kind of a little the okay so i i understand what your your vision is here but it's missing a whole lot wait wait wait wait wait wait let me give you the second part of it before you because you might be right okay the first layer that base layer is the raw facts cryptographical attestations right from from sensors and the sensor could be lying to you of course it could be saying the temperature is 80 when it's actually 30 but it's got a digital signature so you can see its track record you can involve other kinds of things there right um you can match it up you can audit it other people can audit it so you can have a second thing that's auditing you know one out of a hundred of the measurements of the first guy um there's a hyper geometric distribution which is like you know auditing um things off an assembly line like pick a ball and see if it's corrupted or not uh but then the second layer is uh advocates on top of those oracles okay so these are humans and you just assume that a human has an editorial judgment you know why because not just what they write it's what they write about and now the selection function of what specific facts they choose to include is itself visible right editorial judgment is now quantifiable because you have this layer of the raw facts that are on chain and then narrative becomes tangible because it's which facts you actually cite in your story okay and so the selection function is basically just like a ranking algorithm for a social media site that selection function actually is now quantifiable but you can see not just what was included but crucially what was omitted the so this seems like but this seems like an entire so okay so what you're going to do is uh 1729 you're i don't going to hire about 1729 for this whole thing right yeah i know i'm just making that i'm just using that yeah your your media empire you're gonna hire 200 engineers to build this um um what did you call it the um the um lecture record um and then you're gonna hire 200 journalists to editorialize sorry you're not quantum journalist advocates uh to editorialize some of the the facts correct no so i've got a different so it's actually useful i would call what you just said like uh i don't mean it's a bad way but sort of like the real world looking model um here's at least what i'm planning to do which may well fail but you know at least just what i'm thinking about so first is it's decentralized media so what i want to do is invest in lots of individual uh you know diverse influencers pseudonymous voices around the world okay so basically you know everything that's not brooklyn books you know all these other voices that are underrepresented in our conversation ideologically demographically internationally technologically you know like scientific depth being brought to bear those are kind of folks that i want to fund is that right chosen by you you know decentral you know you know what i mean yes yes that's right but but the the like all the tools and stuff that we use for selection funding like the yc style safe equivalent and so on um all those will be public so i want people to pick it up and copy it and so on and so forth right so i'm not at all proprietary about that i'm just trying to set an example uh for what it's worth sort of similar like you know last night um you know i tweeted out like for the code relief thing in india and you know the notion co and the um the uh actually the hubspot founder uh dharmesh actually um rt that so it kind of gave a template that they could then just use and that's that's what i seek to do right um and uh you know the goal being to basically bootstrap a bunch of these voices okay call that one component the second component is to bootstrap the technology which is to say uh figure out like what the right version of using crypto oracles in content is okay um maybe that's going to require a few years of compounding maybe i just write the articles on what that vision of the future is and i'm not smart enough to build it but one of my you know you know portfolio companies or readers or something like that is um because you know we all uh it's all it's all a relay race right you know you hand the baton and maybe someone else can figure out something you did it and so on right so kind of open sourcing my thinking on how we can get to a better model of you know truth right out there and then third is writing a story um so so first is you know like the the writers and the the people who are writing these tasks second is of the technology technology for kind of creating the task creating the content and third is the story which is i have a book uh the network state which i've been i'm a perfectionist so i edit the chapters and i edit them and edit them so i put the first one up at 729.com you know how to start a new country i think it's done pretty well you know like uh it's it's uh it's got a lot of good feedback and i think it's stimulated some thinking and essentially the idea is you know um how do you start a new country well when there's no land the short answer is rather than try to like take over a peninsula or a you know piece of territory or you know or or declare or conversely take over like a oil platform near england and call yourself sea land right instead you have a community that you build in the cloud and they go and take pieces of land all around the world uh which are like you know cul-de-sacs or apartment complexes and so on you network them together such that it's something which may eventually have a scale of hundreds of thousands or millions of people and the footprint of a contiguous state but it's discontiguous and it's networked on the internet right so that's the third part which is a story so it is not simply content or technology is anybody do you think that is there a project out there or do you feel like there's anybody out there who's doing that taking that approach to how do you start a new country create a community in the cloud and then have this like decentralized pods or hubs all around the world where those people actually concrete i think it's a 20-year project and you know basically uh my my one-liner on this is 2000s were the tech companies 2010s crypto protocols 2020s startup cities 2030s network states okay so company protocol city state i think that's where we're going so we are in this startup cities phase right now so let's transition to that real quick so yeah uh what is a startup city is this like sam leaving san francisco moving to austin you know the mayor of miami actively recruiting candidates like a startup ceo would and and hiring away great talent into miami is that what a startup city is to you or is it something else yeah so what's great about the term is it encompasses kind of three definitions right the first is just a city where startups happen which is where what san francisco used to be um you know uh the okay nowadays it's just you know like somebody who's choosing san francisco for a startup i crinkled my eyebrows you know i mentioned it before before the pandemic i said it was like choosing java you know proven but kind of kind of sucks and it's like okay you don't know new languages and you know i'm not sure about your productivity and this or whatever but now it's like choosing oracle for a new company you know which is like right basically you're just getting locked into this horrible cost structure of declining product when far better options are available i question their judgment you know um so the first definition is a city where startups just happen okay the second is a city that acts like a startup which is miami now under suarez which is amazing okay and the third definition is a city that's a startup itself like prospero.hn or cul-de-sac.com or the various startup cities that pronamos.vc is investing in and um the the thing is i think uh you know obviously when i when i said 2000 tech companies 2010 scripted protocols 2020 startup cities 2030's and upper states that's sort of when that exponential starts right what is the analog of bitcoin in 2010 it's startup cities in 2021 right okay where go ahead uh i was going to ask you a different question maybe that's a good one just a good one to drop on your listeners bitcoin 2010 was a pretty good buy or whatever you know yeah exactly that and i actually wanted to know you got into crypto early on i want to know actually what was the uh you know where were you kind of when you first how did you actually first hear about it was it the white paper that you stumbled through a conversation with a friend so how did you hear about it how did you get yes and then how long did it take you to sort of like you know the mind virus infected you completely and you're like oh wait this is actually gonna work so i would love to hear that from you yeah so you know i have to recollect the exact timeline but basically it was something where i'd been thinking about economics and money after the financial crisis because everything broke and so you start thinking more deeply about you know the system that you just thought was functional just shattered into a million pieces and or just didn't work and um i'd been thinking about like how the true definition of money is energy in a sense of j-o-u-l-e-s joules like visualize like an iphone you know coming together like like the rare earth elements and the glass and the aluminum and so on and this and the the silicon just rush like this molecular assembly and how much energy would it actually take you to assemble that from its constituent parts you know like in chemistry you can you can quantify this you know with like uh various various chemical processes how much how much input energy do you need to catalyze it um or to make the reaction run and um so that was like something i was thinking about because if you could reduce the energy cost of assembling something like a phone over time you had genuinely reduced the price right that's a genuine reduction because humans were able to do this thing more efficiently today than we were in the past and that'd be the kind of deflation that you want joule deflation where because of technology we've actually made this thing cheaper to do than we used to be able to do right um now i've been thinking about this and then you know one of my friends you know basically like you know i'd write these essays or whatever uh but just this is before i was a public you know public figure that sounds like anything just you know my academic friends was like okay you should you know look at this bitcoin thing and uh i forget exactly when that was 2010 or 2011 but basically um i thought it was really interesting because it was also using energy you know in a sense a different way to kind of support value um but it was doing something i thought was very counterintuitive the most counter to the thing about bitcoin at the time to me was that the extra computation was not going into increasing the number of transactions per second but rather increasing the security of the system that was a design decision that was totally foreign to everything we had learned about scaling out systems and going parallel and so on and so forth that was that was something which took me a while to wrap my head around not that i thought it was bad i just i was like i just don't understand this or for example the fact that all blockchain addresses were public essentially he had stepped out of the box of what i thought a distributed system should be you know like had made certain design decisions now in retrospect uh these are genius moves but like having all your transactions out there in public on chain um just would have seemed like a like a feature that you wouldn't be able to give up right but with the pseudonymity it's like okay and then now with zero knowledge we figured out with zcash and other things how to add back that privacy right um so i i followed bitcoin but it was actually only after the 2011 crash and recovery that i was like okay this thing really has legs um and i wrote in late 2012 i actually had a course at stanford i gave where i talked about bitcoin and i'm like i'm not sure if bitcoin is the one that wins but it is a very powerful tech um that is like something in that class will be a big deal right and i think both were correct statements i could find the exact pdf or whatever if you want um and so that was around the time that coinbase also got going and actually brian and fred and i i think we first met january 2013 very very very early on in the history of coinbase um and actually like i used the queen bees api in a class that i taught that year um and in a mooc course and uh you know basically that was kind of my story of getting into bitcoin and crypto um then 2013 boom of course happened but it was basically the crash from 32 down to two dollars in 2011 and the subsequent recovery up to like 10 bucks in 2012 that convinced me the thing had staying power because it's very rare that you have something endure a 90 plus drop and then come back right that's extremely rare um you uh so you you def you you you taught you were a professor correct yeah um you were a lecturer i think there was some article i have no idea if it's true that uh you were considering joining the fda uh um was that true yeah i mean or rather i was i was interviewed for uh a very senior role um and sure i probably could have been at least number two that was on the table uh but i i chose not to i mean it's now a few years later i don't usually like kiss and tell or whatever you know but the point the point the point is is that you you have this like academic side of you and which is fascinating you have this crypto guy part of you as a partner which is part investor still part academic but you also have this third part of viewers which is that you've built companies so you you helped build you this is like traditional like this is the most normal part of you which isn't even nor like like the most normal part of you helped build like a 50 billion dollar company called coinbase so the most normal part of you uh i used when i'm freezing my embryos and we just found out that like one of our potential children just had like down syndrome and like oh [ __ ] that's the most normal part of you is that you you built that [ __ ] right well it's funny which is it's funny because i uh for your audience yes i think that's probably true which is weird because that's not normal right right and so i guess uh on the what i'm curious about is on the on the tim ferriss podcast you use one of the more baller phrases to say that you're rich use post-economic i didn't use that phrase tim did but it's a it's a good phrase it was the most baller phrase that i've ever heard of like post-economic like to the point where money doesn't like you're beyond that and because i care about money and it's interesting to me beyond just like you can buy nice [ __ ] but it's like you can think about stuff that you normally wouldn't be able to think about where has most of your success financial success come from this weird part of you that is this crypto investor and got in early or from the traditional part of building companies and there's a reason why i'm asking but i'm curious what the answer is i think i'm uh you know i like to think myself as a pragmatic ideologue where i have a horizon where i have my eyes set on this long-term goal of transhumanism and transcendence but then i'm willing to be as pragmatic as possible in the short run and execute and go down to do lists and so on for that north star right which i'm always conscious of and i wake up in the morning and i go to sleep at night and i think about that and i think i think that's basically uh sorry as you can see i think that's evident you you kind of proved that when we we asked you about 1729 and uh when you talked about it you talked about essentially disrupting you know education making uh making it so that when people spend their time online they're not just frivolously scrolling feeds they're actually learning and earning and burning calories but then if you go to the product it is the v1 kind of crawl where you say okay what's the simple building block that we need to do that let's send a newsletter every day with a micro task that people can do to learn something and earn a little bit of money and so i think you have i think you embody that exact idea of like what's the extreme long-term north star and then what is today's building block in order to move forward and that's why and that's why i was getting like what the hell are you up to well it's funny but uh it's funny well so let me talk about that for a second that is absolutely an acquired language where i have learned that you need you know moritz talks about this half jokingly as you know every app needs one of the seven deadly sins you know like lust greed sloth gluttony wrath pride uh i forget the other ones right um but i think it's close right and um so the you know you know tinder is lust right and twitter is wrath and arguably early google which is pretty actually you know that's pretty high brow like search you know but arguably that's sloth you know um and you know uh then ubereats or or doordash is bloody i love those companies don't give your i'm not trying to diss any of them right um and uh so you know the those hooks basically i think you need to deliver a visceral instant benefit to somebody right where in a second you can explain what it is okay a newsletter that pays you right earn bitcoin for submitting a form in a minute right so instant benefit if you can't give that to somebody instantly then it's too complicated you know rarely there's exceptions you know rarely there's things that um have a very end loaded benefit you know like things like ethereum or rome research.com for example you know that rewarded an academic mindset at the beginning it was very long term right but even ethereum for example there was like a speculative upside you know which was the visceral short-term thing where you could align the short-term mentality with the long-term mentality um but i have to bring you back go ahead go call this bring your best go ahead yeah yeah i gotta bring it back to the original question which was basically i was asking i'm like did you get wealthier from this bitcoin stuff or from building the company stuff and i have a reason for asking um i don't usually like disclose my like percentages or something like that but let's say i've done well from both i've been fortunate from both um it's interesting because as an investor you have um it's one percent or less of the work it's 10 to 20 of the return but at zero percent of the control you know and you know i have never been like a tech guy in the sense of um actually you know there's people who talk about oh you know i had a commodore 64 really early on i was programming you know and so on that's actually that was actually never me um i i played video games a lot when i was a kid but i was a math guy right that's actually the angle that i came into it from you know i was into you know like math and physics you know growing up and you know feynman lectures and all the type of stuff and you know thought that i was going to be maybe like a stats professor or or applied mathematics professor or something like that um and so computers were always just a tool and business was always just a tool only later to you know the reason i got into you know genomics or clinical genomics the reason i did a startup was uh and i'll come back to your point i know you're you've got a good thing the reason i did that was in academia if you raise 10 million dollars in a grant raises in the right term you get a 10 million grant and each row of data costs a thousand dollars to collect you can only do 10 000 rows before you run out of money right whereas if you're making even 10 on a row you can collect a much larger sample and make a much bigger difference for the world right because you can actually do the data and also that large sample thing so the thing is that the zero percent control even though i am an investor and i think i've done fairly well at it and so on i invest on an ideological basis i invest in the world that i want to build and there's probably things which are you know good financial investments that um you know i i i just i'm just not interested in something if it's if it's just making money i can sort of force myself to be in that headspace uh but but i i have to force myself you know yeah the reason i was just asking was just i just think that you're the i mean you're like supposed to be this you're the stereotype of you is that you have all these odd and unique frameworks that create this brilliant ideas that's cool i i dig that but what i was curious about like just what's your life um philosophy towards certain things specifically how do you think about execution for example well it was just like did were you just like well i'm just gonna go and like make this company sell it get the bag now i can do all this crazy wild [ __ ] and everything else is upside and like and that's why i'm wondering because like if that is your strategy i actually think that's kind of cool because there was some practicality and then like genius stuff comes out afterwards and it's interesting i was curious like in that sense i'm not capable of i should say i capable of it i i i didn't just do a job for the sake of doing a job to get the money to then do the next thing um i really believed in both you know council and you know crypto and and you know earn and coinbase um and so like that's how i could put in that level of energy and like you know buffett has this concept of um i don't agree with a lot of his stuff nowadays actually but this concept was as good as like you know if you're if you're waiting to do what you want uh it's like you know waiting to make love at like 70 or something like that you're just deferring it just doesn't work like that right you should start you know working on it now tll says concept of how do you achieve your 10-year goal in six months you know so yeah i think that what i tried to do is advance short-term goals you know maybe a sinuous path right maybe a winding path but i had that long-term kind of vector that i'm that i'm going towards and so the short-term stuff was never oh let me make the money and move on maybe that might have been smarter to do like d.e shaw did something like that right like uh it's it's you know d isha d shaw is the guy who created the the hedge fund yeah the hedge fund they put a ton of the money into protein folding yeah so like and shaw's famous because that's where bezos worked and uh was yeah exactly he built out this indeed shaw was like hey are you sure you want to do this yeah yeah yeah exactly right so i mean there's a lot of effect to effective altruism people who are like this um i would argue that the effective altruism people miss one very important thing which is that it is the production by people of goods that actually makes them feel they deserve things like if you haven't built you feel guilt i think it's a very powerful concept right if you haven't built you feel guilt so if it's just handed to you then you don't actually feel like you deserve it and that leads to a sense that nobody deserves it and everybody's things should be taken down right so um i think that emergency aid is actually very good but like industrialized aid where it fosters a sense of dependency is is bad you know easterly and levine have written about things like this but recursing back up the stack they do this concept of you know work hard make a lot of money and then spend it on altruism for example right and i think that's a reasonable strategy but i find it like holding your breath you know um and i i only worked on those things that had meaning for me along the way but were leading to a greater meaning thing and i've been fortunate enough to do that by the way you know like one thing i was just mentioning to sean um is that it's hard for me to necessarily give advice to folks on the very macro sometimes because in many ways the world has just become more biology like okay um if you were a person who was a nine to five morning person who liked routine who liked you know structure who wanted to hit the same button every day who wanted work-life balance and to come home to the family and you know like have dinner at the same time every night and so on and so forth the mid 20th century was awesome for you um because that was kind of the peak of centralization homogeneity routinization structure is also by the way the peak of like you know mass murder and so on within like china and russia and whatnot both those are related to centralization but in the us at least like a decent quality of life that was like the best centralized model in the world right whereas the rest of the world wasn't wasn't doing so well under that degree of centralization and uh and now we're kind of in the opposite thing where it's like favoring night people who are asynchronous um you know rather than hitting a button the the same button for 20 years at a factory you're hitting a different key every second you know like you're just generating like different information um your your day can be extremely varied you know one day like covet has kind of locked us inside but your day online can be extremely varied you know do one thing one day podcast another day uh maybe play a video game or you know basically the entire diversity of the human experience is a click away you know um and also the uh you know you're rewarded now for diversity of thought and an opinion in a way that you know if now that everybody's a content producer uh the more differentiated your content the sort of higher the rewards you get versus if you're in the previous era there was not everybody was a content producer everyone's a content consumer you just go home sit down watch the box and um and if you try to sort of stray out of line you weren't necessarily going to find your other find other people who had the same convictions as you um and so you know it sort of paid to just toe the party line in a bigger way than it does today where actually will standing out today it's interesting because i think we are in the middle of a um you know the battle of the bulge which that was it's basically like germany's counter-attack and the waiting days of the war which is actually a pretty ferocious counter-attack but ultimately in the long sweep of history was just a counter attack and the long sweep was there right and um what i think we have now is a strong counter-attack in favor of conformity by both you know kind of like the book contingent and like you know ccp right and so i think like actually it's going to be a quite a fight because in my in my model of kind of like these memes and and things all battling each other in this gigantic continent this cloud continent um one of the most powerful memes is a meme that says there should be no other memes before me so you said something that i want to i want to go to you said the world is becoming more biology-like uh meaning uh so what does that mean what does that mean that means that um from nine to five it is you know either like tweets or surges of work right from day people it's like night people are async you know from uh status quo bias to disruption bias you know from um you know sort of the physical world to the informational world the theoretical world like ideas matter more ideas can shape the world more you know um all those kinds of things in many ways you know for example something like soylent okay um itself like i i like the company and you know rob reinhart the founder and his friend and so on um i prefer like a keto version of soylent of which one of them exists okay but as minus the keto thing the concept of just not having to think about it so i can just do more math or more programming or you know just more content that's like i love that right that's a very biology kind of thing right and now of course i recognize that you know there's better forms of food like salads and so on but of course there's worse forms of food like uh candy bars right and so if you compare it against you know what's better then you you'll miss the fact that many people who are busy don't eat well and to eat a candy bar rather than a salad you know and so this is actually like basically it improves baseline health you know in theory if it was more keto or whatever right um and so that kind of thing is something where it fit my preferences and because of that i invested in it and the world just sort of adopted that or like crypto you know fit my preferences for okay it should be programmable it should be decentralized there should be you know like you shouldn't have somebody be able to do bailouts and so on and the world became more decentralized and so so in some sense that prediction of the future is just something where the world is sort of fitting those preferences you know um and that's something that's hard to kind of clone i don't know if that makes any sense yeah that makes a ton of sense if you were i don't know 21 today um i want to give one asterisk which is in many ways though a lot of these businesses do not fit my preferences like instagram and you know instagram's a great company but like going and taking lots of selfies outside or you know like that seems like something you would do bro yeah yeah i'm a very private person in that come on yeah yeah no no like you know i actually tweeted on this before the pandemic like um instagram is for people who go outside is for depressed intellectuals you know like can i um go ahead the reason why can i explain what you look like right now um like i'm in a i'm in a dungeon here you're you're supposed to be this like big shot crypto entrepreneur guy you have what looks like a like a super super old camera zero lighting uh just looking down at like your video setup is so horrible i thought it was gonna be the best i need to actually get that set up so actually i am solving that um so i've got a studio and so on that i'm doing um but basically like you know economics we caught him in transition he's he hasn't he hasn't set up the full remote workstation yet yeah yeah i haven't i haven't done all that yet uh partly because i do have the blue yeti or whatever i did get that so people nag me into doing that um it's sort of something where i go zero or a hundred you know on something and you know so i just use the defaults unless i like actually engage and so uh you know i'm just learning acoustics and i'm learning we're talking [ __ ] a month ago you're absolutely right though you're right go ahead and then okay these guys flew out to our houses and they built us these studios for us because they were fans of the podcast so we literally didn't know anything we still don't know anything we we didn't know how to put this together ourselves either uh and now sam's like acting like we did this no i'm making fun of him because he's like well you know instagram's great but it's not really for me yeah yeah you can figure that out yeah no it's funny a shocker well it's it's interesting because i will value something once it has a dot product with like my north star right so like the dot product you know the inner product in um in in linear algebra it's like you know here's a vector here's another vector and how much do they line are they is it just at right angles or is there some alignment right and uh so the reason that i'm going to be improving i think dramatically hopefully audio and video production is i need the content to tell the story to build a future right right so that i'm going to get good at that hopefully because we need to but before then i just felt of it as sort of being an exhibitionist and it was like not uh you know not my thing right uh so i was gonna ask you if you were 21 today what would you be like what would 21 year old biology today let's say you don't have the tracker you don't have the name you don't have the funds to be investing and uh you know having a big platform to speak on just just yet what would 21 year old you be focused on how would you be spending your time um so what would i do uh first skills wise i would get really good at computer science and statistics uh first and the reason is that every domain has algorithms and data structures which means that computer science and stats are valuable anywhere you can walk into walmart and you start writing down code for uh shopping carts and you know baskets and pricing and so on you can walk into american airlines and do that for you know flight scheduling you could walk into pfizer and start writing about vats you know for drug preparation and you know like a pharmaceutical manufacturing right um reaction connects all that type of stuff and of course each of these areas will have domain knowledge you know but computer science and statistics are universal language and i mean cs and stats i don't mean just like learning programming and uh you know how to invoke library calls i mean actually understanding the concepts and really wrestling with them okay um and the reason is it's sort of like what physics was to the early 20th century cs and stats is to this century because physics was awesome for you know understanding the natural world all these physicists could you know in the heyday of physics go and kick in the doors of any discipline and be like ha i'm going to write down some equations and just change your life you know because you're doing this in a phenomenological way and and we can do it way better um and uh now today because so much of the world is a constructed virtual world you know because we're interacting with it on screens you know something like cryptocurrency is a constructed virtual world right social networks are constructed virtual world so are video games cs and stats becomes i mean it was valuable before but it's even more valuable today so that's a foundational kind of thing and um then you know in terms of domains to get good at uh i would find something you know it sounds funny to put it this way but like an area that you really care about for some reason you know and there's but but that's also a line you know the ikigai concept because yeah so like the four things i i may not remember them fully but it's like what you're good at what the world needs uh what you can make money at um and uh and what you have fun what's your favorite fun doing that's right exactly that's right so thank you guy concept finding what that is so after you build that base of skills right um with cs and stats by the way you can understand finance because it's crypto it will all become crypto you can understand genomics because the acs gs and ts on screen you essentially have a theoretical like foundation in any area you walk into and then from that other concepts can be layered on top if that makes any sense right so it's like a general purpose computer it's a general purpose set of principles then domains uh today genomics big robotics big crypto of course big um i think an underappreciated area is going to be relocation permanent international migration you know that's why i did teleport a while back digital nomadism is going to be huge uh being like there's a thousand pieces of the tool chain for allowing people to go more mobile you know uber and airbnb uber is go down you know to the coffee shop but the next step is uber around the world right how do i just boom pick up stakes and just move internationally right now as quickly as i can for as low a cost as i can i think that's that's a big area that people haven't really thought as much about as they will and i think post-vaccination the post-vaccination world a lot more people value their freedom to exit that's why folks are going to miami and so on like when you're cooped up in a room you want to burst free and so the counter reaction of that is going to be this great migration in fact i wrote about this in 2013 there's a article i wrote called software is reorganizing the world where essentially i said um because the internet is breaking geography because you're closer to people who are three thousand miles away than your next door neighbors uh the underlying premises of the city and the nation state are being invalidated let's say geographical proximity no longer leads to cultural proximity and therefore you know the the uh assumption that people in the shared geography will share the same law and customs is no longer applicable and what it's going to result in is these cloud communities eventually migrating and materializing into the physical world and forming cloud cities and eventually cloud countries as that's now i think with kovitz starting to happen um crypto is a big component of it because those cloud communities can actually have their own currencies okay remind me why i got in this room go ahead sorry one second you said geographic proximity is not is no longer linked to cultural proximities he said it was that the phrase yes that's a powerful one which is uh explain that for somebody who's never heard you say that before sure okay so if somebody lives in a city in an apartment building they often don't know their next-door neighbors may not even recognize the person who's living 50 feet away from them right literally this person is living eating sleeping there but you walk down this hallway it's all closed doors right it's basically as if you lived in a a data center you know like with virtual machines you know like you cut up a server into a bunch of virtual machines and all siloed and compartmentalized and isolated from each other right so you go and you live in this box you don't know who's next door you don't know who's above you don't know who's below you don't know who's left or the right if you don't recognize the people in the hallway but who do you recognize you recognize a person from 3000 miles away who you're laughing with on snapchat or you know like video chat or anything like that you recognize that guy on the other side of the world who you're arguing with you know your social network your friends and your enemies or whatever you know your friends and your frenemies like they're just scattered around the world you know some of them might be geographically close by but even that is pointillistic you know it's like okay this person this building this person this building this was this building and i don't know anybody in between you know right i i mean i i buy into that like i've got so many friends who i consider actually dear close friends that they're just internet i call my internet friends and i i i have only met them once or twice soon we'll just drop the whole internet friends part and we'll just yeah it'll just be like yeah now at this point the majority of my friends are internet friends so that that's just called my friends now at this point right by the way pointillistic i know that sounds like uh maybe it's not a word i made up it's actually like a reference to like art um so whatever it's like lots of little points you know discreet parts here but uh what the the nitpick here is or it's i actually agree with you but i challenge my belief because um like all three of us i think you in particular in your own bubble but really we're all in our in this little bubble of like um uh the future it's not the filter bubble it's a future bubble because it's the way that well that's that's a very optimistic wonderful way to put it i i like that i like that term but like i have i'm from missouri okay my family lives in missouri they once one's a teacher and the husband works at a bar their kids go to school and the exciting [ __ ] that they do is play softball on saturdays do you ever ask yourself the ideas that i'm coming up with or that i'm predicting the future they're really only impacting this small small small tip of the iceberg of people how are they going to impact the random person in nebraska or missouri let alone you know someone in kenya or you know what i mean do you ask yourself this when you're thinking about what the world's gonna look like i absolutely do so here i'm gonna put on my pragmatic executive whatever hat right which is you know you have to focus at the beginning right and um the way i look at it is the v1 goal is to build a community at least with 1729 then i'll talk about the v2 is to build a community of technological progressives who are like i mean sort of like yc's founders but not just tech founders um you know people who are media media founders they're influencers they're writers they're activists for technological progress like isabella bemke she's like a pro nuclear activist or folks who are you know um for faster approvals of drugs and devices right and i want to build consensus among that group that technology is good and that we can work together across borders to help people achieve a better future not a pollyanna you know kind of oh everything's going to be great but certainly what i think of as the bright sun to where the west is today which is black mirror you know and um i think that uh you know that it's sort of like at you know in terms of your efforts how can they scale right so my initial focus is definitely let's call them founders but not just company founders or broader class of founders including media founders protocol founders community founders influencers etc and getting you know some agreement among this group along the set of ideas and then recognizing that i personally cannot solve all the problems of the world and um figuring out how we can build for lack better term positive sum user interfaces for those folks who may not be as interested in the world of ideas and the stuff above right how do we build uh not just positive sound but aligning user interfaces okay and a user interface i use in the broadest sense you know um where like you know the how your house works how your car works how your street works how your community works um how can we actually build uh things where folks are actually aligned you know where um the the founder or the ceo gains or loses just as the average citizen does right where there it's sort of like um and if you see the uh the guy from chad who who just died on the battlefield no no so basically i think it's like the prime minister of chad died on the battlefield right and there are all these memes you know why because like of course he's a chad he died in conflict with his soldiers right imagine like some western leader doing that they don't have skin in the game right and it was it was like a joke and it was sarcastic but it also had like a really penetrating aspect of truth right which is a degree of disalignment of western leaders and you know their their uh their citizens right um because it used to be that a huge man you know like a aspect of being a king or being a leader was you were willing to go into battle right even in like world war one there was this concept of like you know the the nobility the aristocracy was supposed to actually go into battle right of course battle look we don't want to have wars right wars are not good but the concept of alignment i think is a very fundamental one and in the communities and in the in the structures i want to build in the future i think that alignment has to be quantifiable now we're actually seeing this in crypto because um i do think that you know one thing people don't get is that crypto is not just you know the next wall street it's also the next silicon valley because decentralized social networks and so on are built there but even less obviously it's the next yale law and columbia school of journalism and kennedy school of government you know why because yale law gets replaced with smart contracts columbia school of journalism with crypto oracles and decentralized truth and kennedy school of government because the next heads of state are heads of networks okay so let's talk and look what i mean by that is you know there's that saying it's apocryphal but like you know give me control over a nation's monetary policy and i care not who makes its laws right it's apocryphal i'm not sure exactly who said you've heard around and uh so the people who who have founded and run these gigantic crypto networks that are sometimes in the multiple billions or trillions of dollars are essentially like you know basically they're like the you know a fed chair right at least of a state if not the country and they've gotten there by um founding something not by winning this whole popularity process where as a gerontocrat at 70 they paid all their dues and now they finally actually can actually put their theories into practice when they're 70 something you know but instead as actually a founder who is aligned with all of their people and have all opted in to be part of the same kind of thing right so the short answer to your question is quantifiable alignment is i think the ethical way for those leaders to help you know essentially the the population that's not as interested in ideas you know uh let me pause there i think sean had something yeah i actually wanted to transition to a topic that i think is a little bit controversial uh but also exciting and that's uh the controversial part is that you know um i'm gonna talk about crypto social networks so um we've talked about big cloud on here and we got a lot of flack we talked about it because i said wow i think i think sean i gave us flack yeah we gave each other flag i was really excited and you were like dude you're pumping this thing i'm like no i'm not trying to pump this thing i'm trying to explain that um i'm seeing some very interesting novel things here and uh and that's exciting to me like i'm a product person you see tons of products you see tons of apps you see tons of announcements and um you don't always see anything you know it's sometimes years go by between seeing something really really interesting and the really interesting thing about big cloud that we talked about was number one um the growth hack how do you get valuable people onto a new network um well they loaded up a bunch of people's accounts with a bunch of money and they gave you know they used economic incentive to bring high status individuals to a new network so that was interesting the second interesting thing was that um you could you know sort of this robin hood meets twitter you can buy somebody's coin and in doing so if i identify biology as an interesting person in 2014 as some people did um i get to benefit from the rise so a curator would get rewards alongside a creator so somebody who's an early you can invest in somebody whose popularity and reputation is going to rise i thought that was interesting the third part uh and so you know there's some interesting parts but the there's also a bunch of controversy and i think that the place i want to start is i think that these decentralized social networks of which big cloud is one are very interesting because they are like um they took facebook's most valuable thing right like the facebook database the social graph that facebook would uh you know defend with its life uh and they basically put it out there you know as the that is the product here's the social graph with economics built in and now any social network can be built on top of this uh and i wanted to hear what you see in these social crypto social networks because um i think you will probably when you look at your north star you also don't see like 30 years from now it's you know mark zuckerberg owning the four most powerful social platforms and uh we're all users and consumers and have no economic participation i don't think you would be excited about that version of the future so tell us what version of the future you see with crypto social networks and then try to maybe i guess talk about what you're seeing out there today great so i've been writing about this stuff for a long time um and it just disclosure by the way i am an investor in big cloud like a small early investor um i wasn't involved with the project or anything but i um i understand why you know there's some agitation around it and um but i also think it's actually a good idea overall and i think it's uh and let me give a few different thoughts okay um so first is that um a very important concept is that crypto is in a sense the sequel to open source because it's not just open source it's open state and open execution okay so let's say it's not just that you have the source code you also have the database and you can track every single op code when it's executing okay and one of the consequences is you know with twitter or facebook they have the twitter facebook api and they can shut it off one way right and they have you know meerkat or um gosh teespring zynga so many companies that built on top of these apis have had their access throttled or limited or their business model destroyed overnight because there's some change in that one-sided you know relationship right um and the the thing about that is uh that's because if those companies had let the api be completely open twitter's was for a while then somebody could clone the entire twitter functionality and sell ads against and then twitter would be reduced to essentially an api provider and they couldn't monetize that successfully enough to prevent that from happening right so i think you know tweetdeck and so we're essentially cloning the entire interface earlier i don't remember exactly the details but i think that was it so fundamentally the issue was that the the business model for creating an api and a protocol that was totally open that had state was not feasible then okay what i mean by state by the way just for your audience which is maybe less technical that's like database state that stored state that is um information that's not transient okay like uh you know i do a phone call with you that's transient i mean maybe it's stored on some nsa server somewhere but we don't have a copy of it typically right um whereas facebook has state there's a huge amount of data they've got your photo and your messages and all that type of stuff right the crucial thing that crypto enables the reason it's not just disrupting wall street but disrupting silicon valley is that as i said it's open state and open execution so we're moving into the third model of uh internet technologies you know web 3. how much of your day is spent doing some of this like crazy thinking and do building and working on a lot of the stuff i mean are you um do you grind real hard on all this stuff or um what do you spend your day doing that's a good question um i mean dave varies because this is all heavy heavy stuff yeah everything we've discussed is like pretty heavy no and you're what it's you're just rattling this off like as if you just like you've like you've like already said what you're you've already you've thought through and you're like well why am i wrong and then you've already thought through it again anyway like what's your what's your how much time are you uh energy are you devoting to this throughout your day and or like you just go for walks and shoot the [ __ ] like what do you what do you do you know what i have to spend energy on i have to spend like uh i have to spend energy on small things like remembering calendar appointments and stuff like that that is actually what is very mentally taxing for me um it's sort of like uh you know how a sports car is not meant to drive on like normal highways or you you can do it but you just have to like kind of watch out whatever right um what i find hard is stuff that other people find easy at times like just oh remembering that that meeting is in 15 minutes or something like that you know because i get it getting grossed on what i'm doing you know um and and so what i've just built technological workarounds to help with that um and so i guess the answer to your question is this is just how i recreate whatever i just i just i can't stop it you know i just go as like i walk around and think oh that that'd be cool this would be cool and just tap it into my you know tweets or my notes i'm not i'm not like i'm not trying to humble brag or something you're asking what my process is um i think part of it is i do yeah just say the truth i don't care if you're bragging i'm just saying like um in terms of how to replicate i guess what one thing i do do is something you know maybe similar like feynman had this concept that i think about a lot which is um i have a bunch of active problems at any one time like how decentralized social networks how to build alternatives to media corporations how to establish decentralized truth you know these are sort of like active how to not miss my dentist appointment exactly that's right right so um the um those those are like active problems and um then i against them i match solutions you know so those um you know i've gotten you know for example you read something you're like okay this maps to that right um and you know this maps to that because this was a problem that you had two years ago and now you see some concept and it lights up that this hammer could fit this nail right so that's that's kind of what i try to do i don't know if that makes any sense you also kind of help popularize the idea maze concept right was that you who uh kind of coined the id amaze content i coined the term and it was funny because you never know what's going to resonate with people you know dixon actually go ahead i was gonna say that not only resonated with me it made me feel much less stupid as a founder as i was like wandering around so okay the idea may is i'll paraphrase kind of just my understanding of it which was there's this like movie you know this this the steven spielberg version of startups is founder wakes up aha eureka i know you know this is the future i'm a visionary goes and builds the thing it's a straight line and yes there's adversity along the way but the idea like i i solve the problem and then i just do the thing and then like you know reality or at least what my reality was more like was i'm interested in like solving this problem for people or i'm interested in this like kind of new space and it's all kind of foggy and then i think i always think i'm in the eureka moment and i'm like yes and i sprint and then i hit a dead end and i'm like oh [ __ ] this is not how things actually work this was this product this uh distribution strategy is not quite right okay let me backtrack three steps and then let me go down this other fork in the road that we didn't take last time and i get a bit further and i hit another dead end and like you're wandering around a maze and eventually you sort of come out the other side and that that is actually quite a normal process for thinking through it as an entrepreneur trying to try to bring something to life and make something successful that was my interpretation and it made me feel a lot better about hitting those dead ends because it didn't mean you're stupid and not cut from the same cloth it's this is the process or this is one version of the process at least that is a common set of problems so you know carry on go back to the go back go back a few steps and then figure out a new way so did i did i butcher it or is that no that's quite good in fact you know now like eight years later or what have you on it um i'll give a few other thoughts one is it's actually similar to like mining for gold right you know like house i don't know if you see that quote that circulated um about san francisco during the gold rush era and how similar it was to startup era right like yeah you know everybody had crazy plans and there was unlimited amounts of financing for any kind of gold mining operation like that culture interestingly has seemingly a through line for 100 something years right it really sounded like it was describing star culture where they're mining for gold and their theories about this river or this mountain or whatever is the best way to get it and uh you know of course tech culture is not just like the gold aspects the technology aspect but that aspect is similar and so the idea maze is like okay which thing is going to lead to the pot of gold it's sort of like that you know you're sort of like a physical gold mine so that's one interesting thing the second bit is that the maze is time varying so what's a bad idea today could be a good idea in the future or vice versa for example uh pandora you know pre-iphone was only an okay idea and post iphone it finally became like a billion dollar company i'm not sure how it's doing now but it did like iphone was a lift that it needed for ubiquitous audio everywhere right um another is often that very small seeming permutations can radically change the outcomes of companies like i remember you make you guys remember this in the early days of twitter and facebook i remember people saying why would anybody use twitter it's just the status update function of facebook right yeah yeah yeah okay that was a common knock on it but the fact that twitter was default public number one and asymmetric number two meant that it just became a completely different experience than sort of the private set of warrens that facebook is right fundamentally the fact that for the most part anybody can link to any other tweet means it's a connected graph it's just one graph right whereas facebook is something where i probably can't view that facebook post so i don't share it with people so it's a fundamentally private experience so it's actually in a sense less viral now of course i think you know facebook it's a more successful company and i think it gets way more crap than twitter even though facebook is twitter's probably worse for the world in some ways it's better for the world in some ways and worse for the world in some ways it's just this gigantic amplifier but positive and negative all the good stuff comes out of twitter and all the bad stuff it's just it's actually polygram at a good comment on this where it's like the terms are so large that you can't even initially sum them to see like whether it's positive or negative some overall right um oh where was i say i lost my trade of thought uh give me we're talking about the id maze and you're yeah that's right okay so come back so now one thing i will say that i've grown to appreciate more is the the specific idea makes you decide to run really does matter and can be like a thousand x multiplier on the result right so you know look genomics was if i could show you all the good arguments as to why genomics would be a huge deal in the 2000s or 2010s and i could show you the curve of declining sequencing costs and so on but um basically that generation of companies was i shouldn't say capped but it's somewhere between like a few hundred mil to a bill or something there wasn't a hundred billion dollar company that to my knowledge came out of that um and it was sort of like that was like the zipcar era and then there's gonna be an uber era coming up right and it's really hard to know whether you're in the zip car or the uber era of something you know um and often there's iterations on a theme and it just breaks through like and sometimes things seem tired and old like sub stack two or three years ago may have seemed like uh all right whatever just another blog who cares but adding those two features of a monetizability and b newsletter so that you've got um you know because of blog by default i mean it's not i think maybe you can with blogspot do emailing and so on but it wasn't like set up for that wasn't smack in the face for both user and writer those two aspects really changed things and um you know have made subzec a breakout where that was not obvious two years ago or three years ago right ben ben thompson of strategy which subject was inspired by had been kind of just rattling off in his own thing for a long time building his own thing when nobody cared and and then it actually worked right part of this is also the decline of the existing media environment that's what i mean by like you know the iphone came and pandora went from a bad idea to a great idea the decline of the existing east coast media corporations has led to this exodus where this thing that was okay here became an amazing idea because there's certainly a need for it right that all these nails came up right um i think insofar as i'd give advice for people who are thinking about picking the idea you you really want to ask yourself if this is a chance of being an apocalypse shift like search or social or you know mobile or or crypto now right uh or something like that and it doesn't have to be by the way and that apocal shift by the way might be five or ten years out from when you even start the thing you know some companies just go like vertical relatively late in life um but you ideally want to be part of you won't have a thesis on why some huge trend will occur let me give you another example of this by the way teleport which we set up in um 2014. just uh i was just going to ask you all about teleport um i'm i'm trying to find the old website was it dot was it just dot com.org why so can you well the way that i understand it is teleport was going to crawl aggregate tons and tons of data and tell you the best place to live yeah because here's the thought basically um an extremely valuable search engine maybe the most valuable search engine is the one that tells you the economically best place to live because well it wasn't just economically was it wasn't it just it wasn't just economically but the concept was that every other quality of life metric that you had to a first approximation we could have you implicitly put a dollar value on it like how much more is it worth and and i say implicitly it'd be like okay this place is you know three thousand dollars a month in expense but this place is thirty five hundred dollars however it is warmer and so out of millions of like choices like that you could sort of back out the function of how much more people value that extra degree of warmth do you see what i'm saying right yep yeah it still gets a fair bit of traffic it looks like still people are still going to this people using [Music] teleport i think is uh i think we're completely right about everything that people wanted i mean it was fine it was a fine result like stan and you know silver did fine you know um and um why did you say sten and why did you say they did fine well i say they just because they basically just define their careers as a function of that like um those are the two co-founders with me so stan and silver early skype employees and they've done they're doing great um and uh it was it was a fine outcome um but it was also a little too early you know and basically it's something where if teleport and um nomad list is the other one by the way which is also quite good by this guy which i love i think that guy's awesome yeah yeah he's he's uh he's actually uh levels i o on twitter uh and yeah he's good because the only thing that i think he's probably a little too aggro on is like he's so he's anti-investor and there's bad investors there's also good investors so that's something whatever you know probably it might just be a twitter twitter thing where if i got the second bit or third bit of information he might agree there's some value added people or whatever um but uh the thing is that nomad list and teleport i think essentially had worked out the theory of this almost a decade ago you know that digital nomadism would be valuable that people would want to relocate because um the reason i just say economics weather is just you can put a number on it right and so that's something you can plug into an algorithm and um do you know what constrained optimization is yes okay all right so basically i mean is that basically where you put you very purposely constrained something oh to be happy yeah yeah so in in math you know there's something constrained optimization is like um i want to um optimize my uh you know like uh the amount of time that i spend delivering packages subject to the following constraints a you know the uh car can only hold so many pounds it can only take so many packages at a time b um you know it has to have this many stops you know between refueling and so on and so forth you have these constraints on the optimization okay um and what you try to do is you take all those constraints you try to express the entire thing often in terms of minimizing or maximizing a single number that's called the objective okay and so no matter how complicated all the things you are that are putting in the first order second or third order things um you're just minimizing one objective so you think about the best place in the world to live you actually want to think okay how do i like imagine like uh green hills and red valleys like green is good and red is bad like a heat map you know of good places and bad places to live right and so it's a scalar and so you can basically to first order think of that as the net economic benefit or loss i would have in relocating from here to here okay and so you take all of these layers on the world so first is cost of living second is how much you'd make in that geography right third is like you know is there bars or nightlife if interest in that fourth if you're older you know do they have schools do they have airports uh is there is it green what is the you know what's the rule set like you know like uh is x band or is y legal you know and so and so forth all of those you layer on top of each other and you have actually a very complicated mathematical optimization problem right which actually varies for somebody at uh different times their life you know the best place to live when you're you know a 20-something college student you want the bars and nightlife but if you've got children you're probably thinking about schools and just a different set of considerations so the greens and reds change you know um we could quantify all of that right said here is that it would be the search engine that would give you the maximum value right it would basically be something where by changing your xy location you might gain you know like fifty thousand dollars hedonically of which maybe twenty or 30 thousand dollars is economic and the other remainder is in quality of life let me pause here could this company co could this had worked um i mean i was okay it wasn't a failure but it was it's something like zipcard uber if it had been an operation uh or if it had been like the main thing in 20 if we had started in 2019 and 2020 it'd be in the pandemic right like um or you know arguably it's still early i think it's still early because uh post-vaccine is when travel truly opens up you know and when everybody's fully vaccinated so it's like mobile phone installs it'll take a while and hopefully there won't be you know variants that present immune escape that can that can actually get out of um of the vaccine we'll see what happens or the vaccines but modulo that i think you will have a ton more you already are seeing folks going to miami and so on like the the the map is becoming mobile even as states are doing lockdowns you have the other thing which is the centralized lockdowns and the decentralized you know global migrants right so i think tools for international relocation are still early if anybody wants to build like teleport 2.0 or nomad list 2.0 dm me you know with the demo and i'll definitely take a look so i think we're still very early in that space when when by the way right now um i i have no idea where you are right now but uh if you were doing making your own personal teleport list which cities most interest you for for living in long term have you heard the term entrepot maybe i mispronounced it e-n-t-r-e-p-o-t um so that's basically like a uh like a commercial center um you know typically a port or or you know something like that historically but i think those are waxing in importance okay so uh you know dubai right monaco um singapore actually miami which is pretty interesting americans think of miami as a party destination you know with sun and beaches and so on and so forth but antonio garcia martinez actually he was he turned me on to this i had not actually been aware of this till his essay i think in 2019 he's from miami what he said is really interesting which is miami is like the singapore of latin america which is to say that if you've got like a you know mexican national and a guy from paraguay and they want to do a deal they'll do it in miami because everybody knows it they all respect it it's like a decentralized you know demilitarized zone it's got good banking rule of law because based in the us at least relatively to south america latin america more stable currency relative to there we'll see what happens in the future and um so it's a spot where people from the latin and south american you know diasporas they all have like uh communities in miami right so it's actually this international business capital that many americans are just not aware of they just think there's a beach place right so it's actually a great spot for all this tech vc the fusion there is going to be fascinating i think we're going to see way more stuff done not just south of the border but in south america there's a lot of talent down there of course but now you just kind of have eyes on it looking at a new light and you know there's actually another aspect non-obvious aspect which covet is going to increase investment you know what that is no the world has gone remote and what that means is that longitude rather than latitude is now the organizing principle basically what you care about is not where somebody is if they're not in the office then the next question is what time zone are they in right yeah right and so you know this is something there's a website things called time.is i posted on this tweeted on this right but what that means is longitudinal arbitrage okay that's interesting airbnb founders or whatever they did this where they went and worked in argentina because it's sort of like low cost of living at the time and then also like sort of time zone wise you're still lined up with the united states so it's like you can go i'm sure but yeah i don't know if it was was it coinbase was that what it was armstrong did that i'm not sure if the airbnb founders did too but yeah brian armstrong of coinbase was in argentina at a time before columbus uh are you so interesting are you uh are you aware of what it's like to talk to you um no i would say it is like um you know some kind of it's like this it's like an amusement park ride um but it's the one it's the one that's like you know the bungee and it's the bungee only two people can go on at any one time and they basically they swing and they're like super high up and then they hit the ground and then they like spring forward and go the other way and they just keep going back and forth and yeah that's what it feels like because you're like it's like exhilarating there's really interesting topics but you get so high up you know as the as the sparring partner you're like i'm out of my dick and then you come back to root and you say something that's like oh that speaks to my life experience and then it goes back okay well we're too far in the future again i can't i can't i can't see anymore and then we're back to earth and so i meant that as a i mean that as a compliment but i also i was just curious like you know that uh when you're you you're com your brain is completely normal to you you live there all the time uh you know and and for me and sam i don't know i can't speak for saying but i know for me um i love uh talking to you i love listening to you and you know any conversation we've had whether through dms phone call or whatever has always been great but i'm you're the only person i i talk to frequently that that makes me feel out of out of my depth where i'm like you know what i i kind of wish you had a better sparring partner in here who knew what the hell you're talking about and can actually like push this even further whereas what i'm trying to do almost is bring it back down to like and who do you feel that way yeah that's what i was who do you feel that way with oh i mean like feinman ramanujan like you know there's like geniuses that walk the earth right or have walked there like i talked to a guy who's good friends with um what's his name um what's the vc ball uh andreessen mark andreessen and they're like um they're like when i talk to him i just i can't keep up do you feel that is this is what i think i think what you're saying is sort of like is that a good sparring partner for you who do you have good thoughts bars with um and those might be other people that people should go follow or listen to because if they like what they're getting from you maybe that's another person i think i think you know mark and i have kept up a high bandwidth conversation for almost a decade now mark and ben um for sure uh neville robbie kant um you know who's a very good friend of mine uh and um armstrong fred ursum um these are really smart guys who like basically folks who i get a bounce from every single day you know and i think you know i just played tennis with them um but it's also something where they're not exactly playing the same sport you know like racquetball versus tennis so as i learned something you know um i don't know i mean like i i i i try to learn i mean actually sergey brin had a good one-liner on this a long long time ago which is you know every interview he did he wanted that person to teach them something right which did a few things first is men even if the interviewer didn't hire them he gained something out of it right but second is it's also sort of got their um their teaching abilities out on on you know and that's actually useful because you often have to do something within a company then teach other people what you did right coming back up you know think of you know when i do these podcasts i'm they're so they're totally off the cuff right so it's totally you know just freestyle and uh so in the edited version i think i would try to map the points such that it's bullet bullet bullet specific specific specific specific general specific specific general like more disciplined in terms of how i accumulate to a thesis right and i think you know i think maybe two a few good examples of that if you look at the biology.com posts on india you know like uh why india should buy bitcoin how india legalizes crypto um ad crypto india stack i think that's sort of more the sort of workmanlike you know set up this this and this premise conclusion you know over and over again i think it's reasonably well written okay at least it's it's comprehensible but that's like the install software in the most eff install intellectual software the most efficacious way but they do you know what i mean by that install intellectual software yeah exactly yeah that makes sense to me when you say it yes yeah you get it right like what go ahead sam you're gonna say so so you you've been blogging on there for a while i've i've been reading it uh you've been doing you did teleport like in what 2014 which was uh right or ish um which was about like kind of making it making predictions you've been all about predictions i mean it seems like that's been part of your your personality for a very long time what predictions did you make 10 years ago about the year 2020 that were wildly wrong and that and you would have bet a lot of money that they were going to be correct like you're really bought in on them and they've proven to be wrong that's a good question um i mean there's lots of things so many things have gotten wrong i mean one thing that's kind of interesting you know i only really became a public figure in 2013. you know public figure i don't know if you i didn't call myself that now but like i only actually wrote publicly in 2013 before that i was sort of you know cloistered in academia or in genomics it's like it's like an enterprise founder who just doesn't ever take the mic or whatever you know so to speak right um and i had plenty that i was thinking i was writing about but um i wasn't even speaking publicly on it and um i think that one big thing i got wrong was um i i was just never like i'm the personality for cryptocurrency i'm not really the personality for early social networks which were all about exhibitionism and remember zombies that game you know like people wasting time online all that type of stuff that's like totally not me and uh so i i actually you know there's people who dismiss crypto as oh it's you know it costs too much or it's it's just a scam you know they just didn't get it you know for a long time and then there was eventually a light bulb moment um social networks like i i i sort of got the appeal of it being like a facebook online remember the concept of a facebook i'm gonna forget you guys are old enough actually sam you're actually relatively younger but something's almost impossible to google this is funny google the stanford facebook haha you know it's like three proper nouns but um back in the late 90s and early 2000s a facebook was a noun which was it was something that was given out to freshmen um when you came no i yeah you're aware that yeah well yeah and i mean i had my brothers you're probably 10 years older than me yeah i have brothers at all yeah i know you're talking about okay well so that's something which um was a physical facebook and i understood the appeal of like putting that online but i i i only actually understood like the power of social networks uh when there was a friend of mine who was live tweeting a genomics conference okay i was like oh that saved me a flight nobody would have written up the material as well as this scientist would have because they would have just you know messed up the terminology or made it confusing they certainly wouldn't have gone into as much depth and i was just able to like just slurp in and download like five hours of presentations without a plane flight you know um at my laptop in 10 minutes and get the important bits and i was like that i really like a lot okay i actually understand the value of that i did not understand the value of tweeting your breakfast right that seemed to me the stupidest most exhibitionist like waste of time thing in the world so what did you predict that it just i'm like it might sound like arrested you might say small yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i underestimated when social networks were basically voyeurism and exhibitionism and time wasting and zombies and so on i i i did not really think through their social impact right it was only after and the thing is that the reason that genomics thing really piqued my interest is because i realized that was something that would only be feasible when the thing has achieved such massive scale that even this very niche niche niche niche application was feasible you know it's like like you have gigantic scale thing google and then you can google like i don't know belgian cooking recipes or something like that right french cooking recipes maybe that's not that niche but what i'm saying right um so social networks i only after i uh i understood that that they weren't just time wasters or distractions that you could actually learn things with them so i i very much underestimated social um and um i think that i probably overestimated genomics you know uh what i what i got wrong with that was i saw i think all the technology and the computer sciences all of that you know there's a curve by the way that your your audience can google which is like cost of sequencing a human genome like nhgri national human genome research institute and that like was just dropping through a cliff in in the late 2000s and it was clear that this looked like a moore's law like thing and moore's law catalyzed quite a lot of stuff so get into that what i didn't understand as an academic and i only understood as an entrepreneur is what the fda really was you know i didn't understand that like basically the fda is like the primary blocker of like medical innovation not just in the us but in the world people are now by the way catching up to this you know because of the disaster of the fda holding back authorization on covet testing them doing things like holding back the johnson johnson vaccine because like one out of a million people literally are getting blood clots you know this type of stuff people are understanding that their degree of risk aversion is not actually optimal there's both type one and type two errors both false positives and false negatives and uh if you are rejecting good drugs or good vaccines or good tests you are potentially doing as much or even more damage than bad one than approving bad ones and people are only focused on the pr downside of approving a bad thing and not on the unseen of not approving a good thing right you you basically wanted to be the ron swanson of the fda you know you wanted to you wanted to get elected of the territory well no no actually that's why i didn't take the position and in fact it was a surprise to me uh because i the paradox of that is obvious right like um google didn't reform microsoft by becoming you know bill gates google reformed it by building a parallel system and then once it had made billions of dollars and after 10 years of microsoft throwing everything in the book then they replaced their leader bomber with satya and then they reformed and embraced open source right so i don't believe that one can abolish the fda any more than one can abolish the fed but i do think you can exit the fda like we exited the fed and you exit the fed with bitcoin it required like basically you know this uh this this development of both technical and cultural and economic breakthroughs to build a parallel financial system which started off as just a crazy person's you know vision of the future right um but some people got the potential very early on like california was speculating that could be like one to ten million dollars per coin very very very early on i think like on the first threads like if bitcoin took over right i wonder if he was satoshi's friend or a colleague or something like that that was just sort of lending his name to this anonymous project to give people you know a second look at it right hey actually this this pseudonymous guy is actually maybe better than he seems it's possible right point is though that parallel system was built outside the existing system and was completely ethical because everybody who is engaged in it have opted into it right it's not forced on anybody and all the bugs every hack every loss of funds every drop or surge in the price uh every technical difficulty every ux difficulty all that was opted into completely ethical opt-in experiment right at the broad scale which is the opposite by the way of monetary policies that are forced on you top down from above you had no ability to take the non-inflated usd after 2008 right but if you disagree enough with the cryptocurrencies monetary policy you can fork the entire economy go your own way right that minority report does exist it may not be successful but then you know that's in the execution so one thing i think about a great deal is what is to um our existing institutions what crypto was to finance right so you can see already a crypto law with smart contracts for big chunks of law you can start to see crypto media in the sense of decentralized cryptographic truth and the crypto oracles things i was talking about where the foundational assertions are not human beings dumping their chests and saying science capital s you know or with quotations right but rather cryptographic facts by the way can i can i dive into that for a second on quote-unquote science versus science this is a very important issue okay let's do it so you've seen all these people who are like masks don't work because of science masks work because of science right and essentially what they actually are saying is some authority figure has told me that this is true and therefore it is true it's not actually science is not about peer review it's about independent replication that's a fundamental difference right peer review is at best a proxy for independent replication there's a premise that that guy who reviewed it as a peer actually went and grabbed the bubbling beakers and did the experiment themselves that's less and less the case today most of the time it is or maybe it's less than this case forever most time it's like a few emailed comments and like make a new figure okay right so the the actual you know like independent replication is download the code and run it on my machine okay now there's only one thing which has now first let me back every second science is actually the ostensible basis of our civilization you know why it's no longer religion right you don't cite god or the ten commandments as why have this law it is science says that there's a certain amount of emissions so therefore this policy is there right science says there's certain amount of viral particles so therefore we wear masks versus not and so on and so forth right so upstream of everything is a scientific premise which is then coming in uh often from peer review as opposed to independent replication which is subject to institutional capture which is what's happened and you start to get scientists saying more and more ludicrous things that are you know like all the public health people just completely own themselves during the pandemic in many different respects like they admitted that saying that masks don't work was a noble lie right um which which was it wasn't even that noble it was just stupid it was obvious at the time you know um and you can't do that too many times and there's many more examples of that's a particularly egregious one you can't do that too many times before people just don't trust it right so what's the alternative what's up because you know the answer isn't in my view to go to astrology or wu or stuff like that what do we have not science there's only one thing that's more prestigious than science what is that more prestigious than science it's not usually thought of as being an opposition what is it math okay what do i mean by that when i say math greater than science okay it's like kind of a one-liner it's like a funny headline or whatever but let me expand what i mean by that um every scientific paper is based on the collection of data and the generation of like figures and tables and so on right um there's a concept called the open access movement which is about putting research online and taking it out from behind these publisher payballs there's also a concept called reproducible research which says that that scientific paper should be fully reproducible from the underlying data and code like you should be able to hit enter and just like you can template a web page with parameters from a database you can template a scientific paper with uh calculated parameters from that data set okay there's there's uh sites like distill.pub or if you look at what openai does like a lot of their uh papers are basically like interactive websites which operate in this fashion where the underlying data set is like templating the page okay what's the point the point is that um it is when i talk about science as being independent replication yes it is impractical for everybody around the world to have their own inclined planes and cloud chambers to try and replicate all these experiments we don't have those but what does everybody around the world have computers yes that's right they have computers they have phones they can't necessarily do science at home but they can do math on the computer so the more of that independent replication process that you can turn into math the more that people who do not trust a central authority can check the the claims okay now we've already seen a huge victory of this right which is uh you know scientific economics has been defeated by mathematical economics that say all these nobel laureates winners of the nobel prize in economic sciences all went and denounced bitcoin in different ways it can't work it won't work it shouldn't work it should be banned and mathematical economics defeated like these quote scientists and i put them as quote-unquote scientists because they're not you know one of the big things by the way is it's like um scott alexander calls it the skin suit you know like science is like newton and maxwell and the crucial thing is like maxwell's equations have trillions of independent replications every single time you pick up a cell phone you're doing an independent replication of you know the equations for the e and the b field for the electrical and magnetic field right and and a thousand other things you you there's there's equations for quantum mechanics that you're effectively replicating independently confirming because the engineering wouldn't work if the science system right so those things have trillions of independent replications and it's a total category error to compare them to a study that came out last week that has basically zero replications right calling them both science means you're taking things the only similarity is like they're coming out of universities but the axis on which to compare is the number of independent replications not the number of citations number of independent replications and what's awesome about this is this is actually where crypto is if you think about what does it mean to have a transaction confirmed on chain i don't know if you've ever seen blockchain.com have you ever sent any cryptocurrency and refreshed blockchain sean maybe i've sent it a whole bunch of times but i never sort of tracked and traced the the transaction before you know sort of the log i never looked at the log of the transaction look at the log and for example yesterday when i went and said i was donating you know money for indian coveted relief i was able to post the link on chain so people could see the funds flowing and see that i donated exactly as much as i said to the address that i said was going to donate at the time that i said i was going to do it right um and and the critical thing there is there's a thing that says number of independent confirmations how many different miners right have confirmed that a did b at z time okay independent confirmations are very similar to independent replications that's cool they're actually doing calculations all of them are doing mathematical calculations to confirm that this fact this assertion actually happened that you had the digital signature that owned this cryptocurrency zone that seems like a very limited scope but as i said we can expand that to property we can spend it to lots of other things right and crypto oracles what's the point the point is uh if you take the concepts of open access the concepts of uh reproductive research the concept of independent replication and its proximity to the multiple confirmations of on-chain data right uh you can think about something where oh actually all these people have computers so if the code and the data set for every paper were actually on chain not only could i independently replicate at least their post upload conclusions right they may have still falsified the data by the way that's still possible okay but post upload every calculation they're making i can check moreover if all of that is on chain it's an open state database going back to our previous point right so every paper can be compared against every other paper we can have common formats rather than every paper using a different format right we can import a library from a previous paper just so you can import a library from github because again it's all open state right and so now you actually start to make science far more checkable and cumulative because it is only the uploading process which now is in doubt everything that's on chain at least given this data i can check their calculations i can check their figures i can check their tables i can also check their citations because i go back a few hops and they're importing this paper importing that paper and i can actually see that their uh premises i can check their premises as well i can map the trail of citations all the way back right all of which is actually quite difficult to do today you know only google can build like google scholar because they have access to all these journals it's all behind paywalls right some of it has been broken out there with like pubmed central and so on but a lot of it is still behind payballs or it's like a thousand different formats right and this is similar to how you know banking before crypto was a thousand different formats it's like you know this wire transfer and this address and so on and crypto uniforms it or like it unifies it in a uniform address right a dress format that's universal and global point being this is actually a way that uh you can decentralize science by actually realizing that math is actually more powerful than simple assertion and using math and all the computers that we have do independent replications of every post upload claim all right i know i just threw a ton at you there um you threw a ton yeah but that's like a recipe for like what crypto science or decentralized science might look like and just like a quick question you're you were a partner at a16z is that what you were doing um a general partner for a while and then a board partner was part-time um versus you know operating a company you um you're just you're just a weirdo and i love it you're just so interesting you're just so odd and like who like you're just sitting here talking about math and science and we did crypto we did starting traditional tech companies we did uh where to live battle the ball i don't think about where to live yeah yeah like you you you're eclectic um well we can go deep on a specific topic if you want actually i'd love you to teach me something about newsletters because um you built a large one um so maybe you know like i can ask you you know what would you like given that i've got you know a newsletter that pays you maybe you can teach me something about that and i can learn i could teach you yeah i mean i could teach you everything about newsletters i don't know if i could do it today it's 1am right um but i bro i could i mean i i can't imagine there's that many people in the whole world that know more about me than newsletters you know like what you are to crypto i am newsletters it's unfortunate it's unfortunate that crypto is far more lucrative but uh oh you're okay you're quite well and and you know the thing is as you know if you one of the funny things about this whole space this just this tech thing is if you just stay in the game long enough and you take enough swings ones that you just don't expect will just connect much harder i mean like you know there's investments that i've made which i spent five minutes on that have returned more than like five months of work of course you're still taking capital risk you know it's not like a free money or anything like that right but um no i mean you're like you're a very successful entrepreneur and you're in the game and so just put some of that newsletter money into crypto or other things i'm happy or media foundation i did i and i actually i there's like a famous story that i retail over and over and over again but the short of it is i was friends friendly with ross albright um oh and and uh when he was arrested i didn't know that that's who he was and i was sitting next to my co-worker and i go billy my guy ross just got arrested you heard of this thing called silk road and billy it's not same as billy draper oh and he was like and he was like yeah my dad said that bitcoin is like gonna be the coolest thing ever and i said sounds good to me i'll go and buy it so i bought it i don't know what it is but your dad is smart i'll do what he says good so that that's like myself i mean poor ross i didn't actually know his name was albright i thought it was all bricked uh but uh all bro actually i don't know how it's pronounced but uh yeah poor ross definitely uh yeah we weren't like crazy close friends we we've hung a couple times and i lived in glen park where he lived and i was at like in front of the library the day he got arrested on that topic it is surprising to me given all the malfeasance that came out afterwards that that there hasn't been a retrial you know literally like agents falsifying information and so on and that's just what's come out to the public like who the heck knows if you know it was all like i i haven't gotten into details on this but i do understand that like the supposed you know hits that he ordered were all faked and it was just all entrapment or something like that and well the they were faked whether that was entrapment or he meant to murder someone that's up for debate yeah i i i said i haven't gotten into the guts of it i like that you uh i like that you try to like and everybody knows the right thing to do and then most of us don't always do the right thing whether it's food or it's consuming information it's like ah maybe this is [ __ ] but it's entertaining so i'm gonna i'm gonna do it anyway i'm gonna read it watch it anyways uh and it's sort of like you know warren buffett he's brilliant in one thing and then he you know drinks like whatever six jokes a day and eats mcdonald's every day you know he's mcdonald's for breakfast every day he's living until the 90s so his constitution manages to keep up with somehow or yeah yeah i think he's he's pretty stressed for you which i think is it works for him uh do you have something like that where you're like yeah i'm super smart but this is the dumb thing i do and i know it's dumb but i do it anyways watches the challenge on mtv yeah me and sam we both watch shitty reality tv and we're like yeah we know there's better things to do but we do this anyways big kardashian fan a a big kardashian pin um you see basically asking like what you know creature comfort type stuff um i mean you know like you know like things you know us normal humans do no i mean i i like i'm on i'm on twitter or whatever you know and that's like certainly a huge waste of my time um it's both good and bad it's one of those things where you know every time you you you get out they pull you back in you know like godfather right um i uh i once watched a movie yeah i watched tons of movies tons and tons of movies basically like less so recently though it's interesting i you know actually one of the things i found you know just on the like the biology like preferences becoming the future kind of thing right let me give you some this is not the answer to your question uh but let me rip on this and then come back to your question okay um there's for example in 2005 uh when google maps was out but before the iphone came out when i wanted directions to something what i'd do is i would use google maps on my laptop i would screenshot it i'd charge up the laptop i'd also print out the screenshots in the event that there was a power outage and then keep the laptop and the screenshots on the passenger side of the car as i drove okay and that's like that's why i knew the iphone with maps would be a success because i had this crude jury rigged version of it in that interim period when google maps existed but the iphone didn't okay it's like a small example right um certain things that i've been noticing actually as i just talked to you i was like you know i really haven't watched that many movies recently and why is that it's like well so many of them are woke that i kind of just roll my eyes and i know exactly what it's going to be like hollywood's gone so woke and uh and that's just like being preached to right even if you might agree or disagree with some of the like you know principles there it's just like all right again blah blah blah right and uh it's very predictable it means the characters are hacknide it means the messaging is is is just so on the nose you know that there isn't any of the humor and so on that used to characterize it there's so many areas that are off bounds that like it's just also edited and i just found the quality of hollywood has been dropping off a lot another thing i've realized is i don't hire actually from stanford or harvard or mit or whatever anymore you know where i hire from twitter me too okay because basically uh it's first it's international second is you can kind of tell that these folks can write you can see what they're you can see what they're about you can see what they're about it's actually it's like a v1 of this concept of like um it's a com you might think about how you didn't get like too much signal on them from their diploma right yeah you get way more signal from their writing and interests and so on on twitter not just their skills but their values and character right and you know there's like super smart guys in you know nigeria you know smart women in like the middle east and so on who you could they shine through i'm like okay that person right and you've now got like an index on on the world that you didn't have before rather than just buying this this degree right in fact actually i'm not i don't quite say they're guilty till proven innocent but unlike you know five or ten years ago a lot of these graduates of woke schools i mean i think of them as like uh you know like religious education now because that's what they're prioritizing i don't know if you see this thing like they're abolishing accelerated math in virginia and so on and so forth right and uh so so it's actually something where these folks are coming out of higher ed with a religious education that basically means that they are not necessarily all that technically good anymore and a set of priorities and entitlements that is very much often adverse to what is needed to build a business you know and so i i think there's been like the college flipping for me at least in terms of hiring from these places and said you know you want to hire the the guy from the midwest or the middle east who just has like you know just a different set of values and it's just more hungry you know um what's up yeah exactly right exactly what's your hollywood what's your hollywood replacement in that same way so that's your hiring replacement you said your hollywood consumption goes down what'd you replace it with um old books uh math textbooks um i thought something what like normal people do or whatever you know that that's like a fridge uh so you know before i started my first company i was actually about as jacked as as possible to be with my south asian physionomy um and uh so it like lifted and ran all the time i worked out all the time and it was very difficult to do that while operating startup because you know your first priority is like there's always the temptation to make that short-term sacrifice of stay up late or skip the workout to take the sales call and frankly your employees like uh you're at least what i told myself the time the employees you know you give your responsibility to them which um your small health or your hour of sleep isn't as important as their you know because you have a fiduciary responsibility to them you know you brought them on you have to put them jobs move across the country oh i didn't do that deal because i went for a run oh okay well you know and it took me a while to realize that actually that was a false economy and um that you know like spending down your physical fitness or your health is actually something that will also impoverish them in the medium to long run because you won't be you know you can only tap into that uh in your youth you can push harder of course right but as you ouch um as you get older um the uh you just don't have the energy to do that in quite the same way right you can't tolerate asthma are you yo are you are you fit now i'm fitter than i was um i basically one of the things that actually i did at 70 29 is uh you know we've been doing this thing proof of workout right where you can submit like proof of work haha get a proof of work out right where you submit um a proof of work out we give you 10 bucks in btc if it's one of the top 100 of that day okay and it's kind of cool and it's got extremely good response and basically what i realized that for the next thing that i did i actually had to make that part of like the job and the business such that everybody expected me uh just like i expected all our employees to go and exercise and because it was actually something that advanced the company as a whole and i just had you know whatever just i can only do one thing at a time so i needed to actually make that a front page priority in sort of the same way that people um have learned that spaghetti code is a short-term optimization and actually you're taking on technical debt you're taking on physical debt if you are not like working out and eating right each day you know so i wanted to kind of put that in the top my consciousness for the next thing um and i actually think that that daily fitness eating properly etc is on a straight line with transhumanism and with reversing aging and so on and so forth and whether we'll be successful in that i don't know but at least i want to at least set that direction vector i like it i think we lost sam to a bathroom break because we we've broke the the my first million record of longest podcast so we should we should wrap it up um where where can people find you so i know twitter is where i kind of get the most uh so shout out kind of where people can get more where you go yeah go to 1729.com um that's the free newsletter newsletter that pays you in fact where it's got these regular bitcoin bounties for tasks and tutorials and um you know i kind of spoke about what our long-term goal is for what we're doing there short term it's extremely easy to understand which is read a post do a task earn some crypto and then you know like for example we had yesterday uh is um you know learning about how to register a domain name that was very valuable in the early 90s well learning how to register a crypto domain name is probably going to be very valuable and we basically have a tutorial on that and if you uh go and do it and you tweet about your experience then we'll give you 250 if you write a good set of tweets right like educational informative subtweets right right so that's like a cool i think a way to incentivize you to learn something that you should already learn and so we're giving out like five thousand dollars in ethereum for that right so sponsor uh could other people sponsor like could we oh yeah put up five grand for something absolutely so we have 1729.com princess create okay and one thing that i want to have eventually is something you know just like companies have twitter accounts have them have 70 train accounts where every task that they can outsource to the public at large they do and maybe they pay them in their corporate cryptocurrency yeah i love that i love this sort of mini x prize i we've been talking about this on the pod for a while as like i love that the x prize was this kind of big pinata that got a bunch of people to innovate and step up and actually more investment than the prize yeah that happened because of it uh and i wondered i know i i i've now experienced a big company we got acquired and i'm like oh i understand why it's so hard for bigger companies to innovate i wish we were just putting more of things on our company's roadmap just out there and say hey if anyone can whoever builds the best version of x we will like sort of state up front what we will acquire it for what we will pay for that bounty to be complete that's one of the sort of startup ideas i'm most passionate about absolutely so if you're interested in trying out some experiments on this like one big thing is you know i think you're mentioning like startup ideas that you had so one thing i want to do is do prizes for startup editors you know 25k for the best one in 30 days and you know we have the right to put in a safe or something like that you know like um but you know we can we can we could figure out all those things but if you if you just want to try something go to 1729.com from create and just submit a task and its instructions are there and if it's good we may even fund it okay so that's to say like the process of creating a task meaning drafting the copy and the process of sponsoring a task are actually separable things so you could have a lot of people create unfunded tasks and just like a vc goes and invests in a startup it's like a a sponsor invests in a task and then boom makes it go mainstream right so that itself is like an interesting concept where you know you don't just have uh like um let's say hubspot having a feed of tasks it also has a queue where people can propose things that would be interesting for hubspot to try on its audience you know that's sick man we're all right so thank you for everything yeah thanks for uh thanks for coming on you know it's great to have a smart guy come and chat with a couple of bullshitters like us so uh we we enjoyed the conversation thank you speak for yourself you guys are too self-deprecating you've done a great job you know your show is great and uh your your feed is often insightful and uh you know uh you know mutual admiration so great job i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back

we keep investing in this business a lot of people don't understand it it's called medi-maps it's been losing money and we've been building out this network and our thinking is once we have the network there's a lot of really interesting things we can do with the network it's going back to like understanding a moat no one can compete with this we spent the last five years losing money and building the network and now it's like there's no way to disrupt this and think of all the different things you can build in this i always like to say we like to buy airport businesses there's one airport in a city if you want to go somewhere and fly you've got to go and sit in the lobby for an hour and when you're sitting in the lobby i'm going to try and sell you a bunch of stuff so i've got all the stalls and i can put in a massage place and i can put in a bookstore somewhere to sell sandwiches whatever and this is an airport business and right now all the stalls are empty and we're going to start monetizing it and filling in all the stalls

if you're like 22 23 you're smart but you chose not to go the traditional path that feels right but then you also just get these like hunger pangs of like doubt you're doing the right thing every day you're just making stuff you're trying stuff you're making content you're having a blast with your buddies we're going to measure the scoreboard when you're 30 not when you're 24. that was the game changer advice i wish i had and that i gave them and maybe 35 or 40. like you're planting seeds don't go dig up that seed the next day and be like this didn't grow into a plant like no plant that seed water it enjoy it let's look at this as a 10-year game the fourth quarter is 10 years from now and the seeds that you're planting it's it's it's it's and then suddenly it's like oh my god it worked it hits your learning does go up every year where you're like oh man last year i was such a dummy i didn't know about and now i know better how i would do this but your results can kind of stay flatlined for like a decade before it actually stops being a flat line and it just like curves up rapidly

have you heard of ad astra which is like elon musk's personal school that was inside spacex he basically needed to have his kids be in school and he kind of was like you know the traditional school system is not so great why don't we build a school inside spacex his big thing was why don't we teach kids how engines work rather than what a wrench is as like a basic analogy there's a guy i think josh has his name he runs the school at spacex the kind of the fundamental premise was kids were learning by really like playing games the game system was called synthesis and what he did was they spun it out with elon's blessing elam was like hey go for it and he paired up with this guy who was like the number one engineer at class dojo and so they got together and they created this company synthesis i guess you can't share too much of their numbers but they have this amazing traction so far business is only six to eight months old they've spent zero dollars on paid marketing all the attention has come because of free press and people who are reading about elon school and just sort of click the links and find them so i was like what's not to love great impact super cool product i want to send my own kids there and like tons of room to grow because they haven't even started marketing yet

Shaan (@ShaanVP) and Sam (@TheSamParr) might have set a record with this episode in terms of ideas! We start with Shaan laying out his case for why a "Barstool for tech and business" would work and how it should be done. Sam pushed back a little bit but admits it's possible. The guys then talk about the booming software course business. Valuations are sky-high for some companies in this sector -- Shaan explains why. The guys also revisit internal media companies (they'll invest if you're doing it). The guys also break down: a NYC tours business pulling in $1m annually, "Manhood as a Service" businesses, and renting chickens!

if you're building one of these please reach out to me i want to invest in all of these i want to invest in like 20 of these companies i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on the road let's travel so we're going to talk about what you guys can expect in today's episode but before we do um so my first million we actually just went from 80th in in our category on on the itunes store which is a big deal to us to like number 14. and one of the reasons why we did it was because you folks who are listening have clicked the subscribe button so if you're using itunes or using an apple product can you please do me a favor uh i want you to go and click subscribe so go to uh our my first million page and click that subscribe button and then we have this email address um mfm so my first million mfm at the hustle dot co send a screenshot of you subscribe and we're gonna do a call out of you on the podcast so say like your name and then show me that you subscribed send it to mfm a screenshot and we're gonna uh give a call out and actually we're gonna give a call out at the end of this episode for all the people that did that previously and now let's hear what we're gonna talk about in this episode go ahead sean uh yeah we got a bunch of topics i'm excited about we talked about creating bar stool sports for the tech industry we talked about internal company podcasting platforms like spoken uh we went on a crazy detour for crime walks manhood as a service rent a chicken we had a bunch of good topics in this week's uh in today's episode this was probably if you like ideas i would say you're gonna love this episode sometimes we're a little bit light on ideas we were super heavy on ideas today so i think you guys will love it great see you in the episode so we we just were talking for a few minutes about the podcast updates uh and what we're doing to make it grow but what i was about to tell you sean is i have this doc that i'm going to send to you and so you know have you seen how i don't know if you've seen this or not but the podcast goes in the email i think every day now oh and i have not seen that yeah and i'm the one writing it and so i have a we set this up so it's gonna the you're gonna see the clicks in this document that i sent you every day um but anyway it's going well today did you see that graph i sent you i tweeted it out i was like this is what i'm talking about uh there's a basically you sent a graph of the itunes rankings for us business for the business category i would get i guess pretty big category and um maybe we usually hovered between 80 and 100 like we were number 80 number 100 i guess like that was kind of like our norm and then sam takes over growth and like boom step change we're up to no we're we're now ranked number 20 for the last i don't know a week or two um you could just see when you started working on it it's like a direct thing which reminds me of like a very uh a lesson i always teach everybody on our team because there's lots of marketing things you'll do where you're like did it work and it's like i don't know we got to look into it oh it wasn't trackable it's like no no just show me the revenue graph show me the user graph like if i can't notice something happened on this day or hey we started growing around this time then it didn't work enough right like because usually when you're in a small project you need step changes you don't need one percent you need 10 30 50 type of changes uh to work and basically where we are now is i mean you and i could are both very capable of doing this you just kind of look at the it takes about two weeks it took about took me about two weeks to talk to people and to look at the numbers and it's like oh okay i now know that if i only do this i'm gonna be mostly there right um and what i've learned now is it's getting people to click the subscribe button on itunes if i get people to do that mostly everything will will be fine okay but that's gonna sound uh overly simplistic it's like yeah all i gotta do is get checkmate and then i win a game of chess like well yeah but uh how do you get people to click the subscribe button that's kind of the question i mean it is it is not overly simplistic it is simple it is get people to click that button now the not simple part is how i'm going to get people to click the button but the way to grow is simple i just get people to click that button and we've got loads of ways for one i'm just asking people so we um we asked people to leave a review uh the other day and when i asked people to leave the review that day we had 600 reviews do you know how many reviews we have now i don't know if there's at least a few hundred that came through yeah 1400 okay so we added 800 reviews just off of a quick one minute ask hey if you like the podcast go review it uh we really appreciate it that's kind of all you offered really it wasn't quick i like begged and i begged them but yeah right it was sincere uh yeah what i'm saying is it wasn't like rocket science so you you know i guess like one of the reasons i want to share how we grow this podcast is because the way we grow this podcast is kind of going to be hold on mosquito on my desk no too slow uh okay so one of the ways that we're going to grow this pod or one of the reasons we talk about this is because the things you're doing now is stuff that people can learn to grow whatever their thing is and so i would say so far two observations number one intensity uh when sam does something he really like throws himself in in a you know a more intense way than the average person the average person thinks they're doing it and then we watch sam's level of like aggression and intensity towards something you're like oh okay that's what a level 12 is like now i know what now i know what the sort of theoretical max is okay so that's one lesson uh i get to see i guess other people don't get to see on a daily basis but whatever second thing is start with the stupid simple stuff okay we want subscribers well have we just asked people to subscribe right like have we tweeted saying go subscribe have we said it on the podcast hey make sure you subscribe to this thing go push this button and um that takes zero effort but actually yielded like gain because it was just low-hanging fruit and i i know that a lot of smart people would have talked themselves out of that because they would be afraid to ask uh anybody for anything they're just afraid of getting rejected afraid of coming across as a you know salesperson or beggar or whatever so they're just afraid to ask and secondly they would have over complicated things they would have said well i gotta go do this sophisticated strategy and it's like wait well have you tried the dumb strategy first yes uh i completely agree uh and like that's why i always make a joke that when i meet really smart people like we we interviewed um biology the other day and i i don't know when that's gonna come out in relation to this when this podcast is coming out but soon and he was like one of the most high iq people i've ever spoke to i think he might have been the highest iq person i've ever talked to and it was very obvious and when i was talking to him i actually was wondering i'm like you know for the longest time i actually thought that the lower your iq like you want your iq to be just above average but not really high because the really smart people i meet other than him they typically talk themselves out of anything and and so anyway i actually think that being just slightly above average is optimal that's the sweet spot i didn't get to ask him that but i would i would love to know his opinion of that of like because like when you meet him and he must know that he's like a kind of a genius um right he can't kind of because you know he's gonna be humble about it he's not gonna say yeah clearly i'm smarter than everybody but he is clearly smarter than everyone so i know where you're going with this top one and i think i've got a i've got a strong opinion on it you want to do your bar stool for tech you've talked about this many times okay yeah so so maybe we'll keep it short but well i don't know i mean you i know what you said but we ha with our listeners they probably don't okay so bar stool to me is a super interesting company not just i'm interested i'm a fan i i consume some of the content but i'm more interested in the business behind it so they basically went into sports media which was dominated by espn and they you know the upstart made it they started with nothing literally dave portnoy was you know writing a newspaper himself and then going down to the subway and handing it out to people on before they got on their their morning commute that's how that was the humble origins of that not even like a blog like a physical newspaper he was handing out like the paperboy and he was the writer um and he was the editor right and so so that's how we got started and then ultimately you know they sold for i don't even know you probably know 675 650ish yeah so so great outcome and like you know they actually mean something in the world a lot of people really love bar stool they care about barcelona great so why doesn't this exist in the world of business or the world of tech so what did bar stool do and could you apply that here so what barstool did if you listen to dave's early interviews he basically says look um i want we are an entertainment company so that's that's the first thing we are trying to make people laugh and have a good time if you go to espn that's not their mind that's not their mindset their mindset is news information analysis um and yes we are entertainment but like we're entertainment through news information um you know official game games and uh and analysis and barstool has no no rights to the games they don't bid for it they don't they don't own any nba games they don't know nfl games um they don't do much analysis they don't do much sort of information they don't they don't tell you the news they don't tell you who won and lost and how many points they scored but they really focus on that last bit which is making people laugh and being entertained and so i think the world of business is full of espn's it's full of information analysis um you know like kind of like official broadcast of of content you know whether it's you know interviews with the companies and whatever i think somebody should make barstool for tech which is i'm here to make you laugh you're you're into the business world you're into the tech world the startup world whatever it is pick your niche and um every day we're gonna report news that makes you laugh and today there's like the onion that does that so i would say that's like an example of someone who does that uh but they're very extreme and maybe that's the right way to go um there was like kind of valley wag or these kind of gossip blogs so they took gossip and they brought it to business and tech they kind of got sued out of business later but they were popular for for a time um and there's kind of nobody else and i think that if there is a dave portnoy out there if there's somebody who's interested in this stuff and they're funny as hell or they have this comedic taste you could build a media company doing this that's my theory i feel like you disagree give me give me your take yeah so i don't disagree with you i think it would work if you could pull it off i want to explain to you why this is hard to pull off so when you're a sports journalist who happens to be funny which i actually think a lot of those people start they're like they love sports and they're happy to be funny and and that's typically how it works now you don't really have that many options you can work for the local newspaper you can try to get one of the few jobs at espn but regardless if you're lucky you make a hundred fifty thousand dollars a year right right and you're tabling the comedy side nine times out of ten you're like uh you know i would say this joke in my text message group with my buddies but i can't put it in my column on espn if you're smart enough to do this for business and you're funny you now here's the where the rub you likely can get paid a ton of money as some type of analyst or some type of investor or some type of operator right and so it's really hard to retain those types of people because they say well why would i make like if i'm this smart i'm just going to go and trade stocks or invest in companies or start a company versus give you my opinion and make you laugh for eighty thousand dollars and this is the problem i've always had at the hustle which is how do you actually like a lot of the people who are best at and analyzing companies and giving opinions they sold their company for 80 million dollars and so i have found it's quite hard to retain those people whereas if you are a journalist in sports that's like the end goal is to be a journalist in sports right do you know what i mean whereas when you cover this stuff the end goal is to start or join an early stage company that's going to be massive and so i agree with you that you could pull this off or that if you could pull it off it would be a huge hit it's just that that's one of the hard parts right and so so i i agree with you there are uh there's higher opportunity cost for a smart business person who has a good sense of humor to do many things but but but here's the kicker i think this could be fun i think this could be cool and i think that there's enough people out there that aren't gonna know how to parlay their you kind of need just above average iq and then two standard deviations above average uh like kind of internet funniness um to make this work and so here's my pitch there's the camera i gotta look at trung i'm looking at you charlie look at the look at these eyes i'm looking at you right now trung this is what you should do my friend you need to you need to leave the hustle you need to leave hubspot and you need to create the bar stool for tech you already are doing it on twitter and you need to create it but here's the kicker here's how you make it more valuable it's not just a media company this would actually be an investment fund so you would be a vc fund whose brand is built through journalism whose distribution of how they help their companies is through their media arm and so you're a media arm whose business model is your vc fund and that's actually what i was going to say is i think that would work but you need to be a vc fund first who then hires content people and offers them like some upside there you're a vc fund in disguise is kind of how it started because you do have to build up you know good distribution and it's not again i don't think it would be hard because there's nobody really creating this type of content there's nobody that will just straight up make fun of zuck when he's talking like a robot somewhere right like uh and that's the type of stuff that dead spin and bar stool that they do they they find funny memeable moments and they talk about them and and that that's why trump came to mind because he did a tweet the other day about uh steve ballmer and it was like information it was like steve ballmer did you know when he first joined microsoft this was his salary and then he renegotiated and was able to get this much equity that turned him into a 30 billionaire or whatever he is now and by the way he did the whole thing he has this like steve ballmer in four decades and each time he's wearing the same white you know new balance dad shoes and he's like he did this the whole time wearing these new balance shoes like anything is possible and i was like this is the perfect blend of a useful information nugget wrapped in a joke poking fun at the bear and um and so i think that that's a that's that's the model so anyways i'm bullish on this sorry for trying to poach uh trying to convince him to go do this but i think that would be the ultimate manifestation of his talents or somebody who's like chung if you're the next chung out there i don't know you so i'm not i'm not saying trunk is this i'm also not saying trung is not this but when you hire these types of people because what makes them good also makes them a pain in the ass to work but sometimes you know like what makes them good is that they're they're hilarious they come up with stuff like off the cuff uh but they're incredibly challenging to contain um and you don't want to contain them necessarily but like there is some [ __ ] you need people to do i'm kind of like this right i showed up 10 minutes late today i know you hate me being late i wasn't trying to be late but i'm late but also i'm good i'm good at what i do you could find so many shows up on time for the podcast but it's hard to find somebody who's going to consistently great create great content right that's the rub with talent i've learned how to put up with that but that is the part where sometimes i'm like ugh i should just start a software company where the code is never late and the code never complains about x y and z not right this isn't a trunk trunk i love you this is just me as well i'm a create i'm a creative person as well i'm like that and so creative people are hard to contain um you want to talk about slips because you were quite uh interested in this okay so check out dude why don't you always say i don't think you're gonna like am i like a default i probably i posted it i posted it in slack and you go i hate course businesses so that's what i'm basing this on you're like why are you saying i hate this like you literally an hour ago a company that publishes courses i think is awesome to own horrible to invest in am i wrong uh i don't know maybe what do you mean company that publishes courses so who's that like what uh well no teachable is a platform um this is a platform so let me explain what this is so the domain is slip.so and it's a company i'm looking at potentially investing in i saw it and it immediately was like oh this is a smart idea so what did they do they make it easy for any developer to create a course to teach you know some programming you know either a language or how to make x or how to make x go faster or whatever right any developer teaching other developers so why do you need so why do you need a new platform for this why can't you just use udemy or udacity or one of the other 10 platforms well those platforms are all teaching through video so you upload a video and maybe some text or pdf and um and then people go take that course self-serve what they did was a little bit different they took the today the best ways to learn how to code online or interactive like we talked about codecademy uh or is it code academy i don't know but codeacademy.com yeah yeah i'm going to say it fast so i don't you don't know what i'm saying if i'm saying it right or wrong cudaway activity.com you go there i think they have like 40 million users or something it's really grown over time it's a thing and all it is is it's a like you don't have to have it's the like if you ever tried to learn how to code first you got to download the like the text editor that's what you're going to use to write your code and then you got to download like the python packages so you can like deploy what the [ __ ] is all this i don't even know what python is yet but you need that to get started so what codecad we did was brilliant was they just put it all on the website all in the browser so you go to the website there's a place to type and you don't have to install anything you have to download anything it just says look right variable equals a now you made a variable called a fantastic that's you know level one complete level two let's do a plus one and like you do it and it and if you get it wrong a little hint pops up it's like a game a hint pops up and says type a plus one so anyways or you're missing a comma or whatever so um so code academy built this and they are a teacher so what slip did was they made a platform but they made the code academy like sandbox or toolkit available for any dev so let's say i'm a developer and i'm really good at front-end development and making parallax scrolling websites so i want to teach that but i don't want to have to build the underlying infrastructure that codecademy built in order to just let students come learn from me that's way too much work so what this is is it's code academy to box any developer can now create a interactive course and teach other developers and they can make money for sharing what they know so i think this is pretty cool i like the idea of letting developers become teachers i think we're going to want more programmers over time and i think that the building that underlying sandbox that infrastructure that lets anybody have this kind of like codecademy in a box i think is a cool innovation that's going to save people a lot of time so i'm kind of bullish on this but it's very very early there's not much traction uh you know just got started what do you think hmm have you done the math behind this like how many so he charges i think if you are a developer who's using it i think it's he charges 30 bucks a month plus 10 of the sales for your course that's his business model he himself taught a course so how did he arrive here he created a course on learning vim i don't know what vim is but it's some [ __ ] delivers use so vim's like you're it's basically like you're you know uh you're uh it's kind of like your your virtual machine basically about how you organize and write your code i think uh or maybe it's something completely different sean doesn't know so he created a vim course and in order to do that he me he built the infrastructure for himself so that his students would have an interactive way to learn this instead of just watching videos and trying to figure it out themselves they'd have a sandbox to go go and write the code to learn he made 10 15 000 selling that course and then he was like oh dude i should make this any developer like i know vim but what about the next guy who knows solidity and they're trying to teach ethereum programmers you know how to write in solidity they can now create their course using the same toolkit that i i create i use for myself so i wish she would have started this like six years ago so right now these course businesses are actually these course platforms we're going to call them they're not publishers they're tech companies they're actually booming right now so do you know a company called thinkific i've heard of it but it's it's kind of like a kajabi right it's like just a it's like a teachable it's the same thing right do you know they went public yesterday i did not know this how how big is it they went public yesterday on the canadian stock exchange uh the toronto the t s e is that what it's called toronto stock exchange and look it up right now for some reason when companies write like in the first couple days of going public it's like impossible to find the market cap i don't understand why it's so hard but it never shows up but anyway they only had 20 million in sales and they broke even or lost a little bit of money so they went from 10 million to 20 million in 2020 and guess what their market cap is right now it's gonna be like uh two billion dollars or something stupid it's over a billion dollars their market cap is and i was i asked don cor so our friend ankur he started this company called teachable when teachable sold they sold for i think 250 million it's this is uh uh public information just google whatever the headline says that's what that's what i'm trying to say yeah i think it's 250 ish and i think he was only doing 25 million a year in sales if they had only raised four million dollars it was a really straightforward simple thing i mean hard but simple and now thinkific is quite similar they went public at with a huge massive valuation and i was like ankur why are these valuations so high like this is just stupid and he goes it's because of and i don't understand how this i don't understand this but he's like it's the payments business so i guess once you get someone to start spending you save their credit card and then they'll continue buying stuff and that's one of the reasons why investors value these companies incredibly highly at the moment is because they want the payments revenue i don't entirely understand i don't i don't understand mechanics there but the way i would think about it is these are just shopify so what does shopify do shopify maybe anybody can create a storefront what they're saying is it's shopify but instead of selling you know hats and shirts you sell information which is super high margin and if you think okay shopify there are now x number of hundreds of thousands of sellers and shopify is a hundred billion dollar company um okay maybe retail is bigger than the sort of uh you know additional education business but um but you know we have a hundred fold you know from a hundred billion which is shopify to 1 billion uh you know you can you can be 100 times smaller than shopify if you create shopify for education if you make it so that any educator can come and create a storefront to sell their their information and that's what teachable is trying to do that's what many companies try to do they're all splitting that pie in a way but i like this one because i think it doesn't compete with all those i think the developer ecosystem you know developers teaching other developers or want to be developers is quite differentiated and the product is quite differentiated from what teachable like teachable kajabi thinkific they're all the same it's just you create a video library you charge students they get access to the library and then you know the teacher can communicate with the students or whatever i was on twitter i think i just saw i don't know i don't know maybe one of my guys sent it to me i don't really recall um i think zack actually who is my scout for my phone i think he saw it i was like this is cool and i was like as soon as i went to the landing page something clicked with me now this is still very small i think can you i think he's under a thousand dollars of gmb right now like i think he's got like a couple teachers who it's been live for a couple weeks and uh you know he's getting a thousand dollars what's that what's it called slip sl what's the url slip so um yeah look it's neat i think i've always had a little bit of a problem with this type of stuff because whenever do you know what the finish rate is for courses you know it's like 10 60 yeah like so uh a hundred people buy it only 10 if you consider using the product doing the whole thing only like 10 of the 100 are actually going to do it if you're lucky i have a friend who just sold he's doing a course it's a couple thousand dollar ticket price right so people putting down a few thousand dollars to learn this thing and uh he said guess how many people are finishing the course uh i was like oh no don't tell me it was like i think i think 12 people had finished the course it was like you know whatever less less than less than six percent i think had actually finished the course he also said guess some people got to 50 i think it was like 20 20 something percent of people had gotten halfway through the course he's like did i make a shitty course and i was like no dude this is just what self-serve education is when it's self-serve and there's no pure like peer pressure there's no like accountable teacher who's like training you every week or you know you're showing up to a live live thing when it's it's netflix it's on demand i can go i can go learn more whatever i want i paid for the thing even paying thousands of dollars is not enough skin in the game to do this it's very counterintuitive it's not even you you paid 60 grand a year or whatever you paid or your someone paid to for you to go to duke and you missed classes oh yeah that's a great point yeah i was uh i basically you know for four years i took a four-year piss down the drain of my uh my college tuition this is the way i would describe that experience so anyway that's one of the reasons why i'm not like all gung-ho about course businesses because i'm like damn like no one uses your [ __ ] i'll say this not all have that low complete rate i invested in maven uh guggens you know guggenbein's company he did udemy he saw that low completion rate problem he created this cohort based course uh product where you get a batch of people in they're gonna do the thing for a defined period of time five weeks there's live instruction every week and the completion rates are way better right like that that dramatically increases it lambda school i invested in lambda school lambda school had like 80 completion rate when i invested way back in the day and so i knew something is different about this company i knew the standard is six i knew these guys had 80 plus and i was like what'd you get different he goes well it's live uh you show up to class with a bunch of other students and a teacher and um you know so and we do good filtering up top most course companies they're trying to sell as many seats as possible lambda school is the opposite it's like at harvard they're trying to only accept the one percent of students that are actually going to do the thing and so you know depending on the business you can get wildly different outcomes but yeah you're right as a general rule they're com you know the usage kind of sucks dude you have so many ideas here where did you find all this so what the hell is um you inspired me dude you were working on growth and i was like if he's doing growth i better bring the [ __ ] heat on content so i was like i'm coming with a bunch of ideas what the [ __ ] is spoken sounds sick yes okay you wanna do spoken so spoken s-p-o-k-n it's podcasting inside companies what's the url s-p-o-k-n i don't know you'd have to google it i don't have the url i did i i i it's so new they don't even show up really oh [ __ ] sad because i'm giving this guy a shout out they're growing fast got it if you it's getspoken.com or if you just google s-p-o in quotation marks you'll find it right and tell them i sent you so um okay so what is this so i when i first started this podcast i used to record out of a studio and in san francisco there's like this old radio station place and they were like ah radio's kind of dying what if we converted these radio studios to podcast studios and so they were the only one in san francisco uh if you just like google for it it's kind of amazing 100 bucks an hour go record and um and so i wanted good quality so i went there and i used to book like on their little scheduler and some days i would see it was just like all booked and i was talking to the dude and i was like who the hell is booking how many podcasters are using this thing i feel like it was like not many people yeah would do and he was like oh sorry that day uh facebook booked all the hours i was like what do you mean facebook booked all the hours facebook i have a podcast i go oh facebook has tons of podcasts internally i was like what because yeah they have like a managers manager's podcast that is just a internal podcasting uh podcast for facebook managers to talk about managing inside facebook and i was like oh that's actually kind of smart like we've talked about this before internal media companies i think this is a big opportunity you think it's a big opportunity we've talked about it from a blogging point of view newsletters um we've talked about it on like uh like kind of like like central announcement dashboards so building tools for companies to better communicate building basically build an internal high school newsletter a new high school newspaper i think is what we called it what is the high school news newspaper for your company yeah i think this is so awesome ever since you said that i can't get that idea out of my head if you're building one of these please reach out to me i want to invest in all of these i want to invest in like 20 of these companies i'm trying to find that episode do what would i search to find it on google my first million internal internet what do we what terminal mail mailchimp for companies i think i don't know what we called it at that time but the core idea is just like a high school or college will have their their school newspaper why don't companies have the same and if there's gonna be a newspaper it's not gonna be literally a physical newspaper in this case with spoken it's a podcast for inside companies and companies will clearly pay for the like kind of like the platform the recording the library and the like private private feed um that others can't access that's for your company and uh you know the companies that need this are very large companies and so i don't know realistically like okay so i think that's all cool i don't know realistically how many people at facebook are like [ __ ] yeah i'm like commute to work today i'm gonna listen to the manager podcast like maybe nobody wants to hear this [ __ ] uh but maybe they do like maybe there's interesting personalities i know that if at twitch if twitch had an internal like podcast i would do one i would do one on you know managing or product or innovation or whatever i don't know and i don't know how many people listen to it but i think it's a very interesting niche that turns it's a niche podcasting that is highly monetizable what do you think uh yeah so on on the surface i think this is so badass i've been a fan of this idea for a long time i don't know where we came up with this idea but i've i've i think that at the time we discussed this we were like oh this might be one of the most straightforward ways to make a lot of money on this podcast that we had at that time um i'm looking at we were talking i think we were talking about it because i was publishing my three two one um or my 123 newsletter uh inside twitch i had told you hey here's a networking hack i'm doing inside the company i write this thing i send it to all the execs like the 25 person exec team or whatever and it's just a great way to stay in front of people and stay top of mind and help them get to know me and it takes me one hour and i get i essentially get an hour with all the execs just by me putting the one hour in um and so but i was saying you know i'm just sending this in gmail why isn't there like mailchimp or convertkit for sending stuff inside companies that's kind of one of those great company called recess it's called recess dot io and yeah i bet you've grabbed it so by the way episode 53 is where we talked about it if people want to go 53 all right i'm going to write that because i'm actually doing this this series where i'm going to go back and look at old ideas and this is a good one um recess dot io it's started by this guy named ryan dice it never really got off the ground but it's called easily send internal email newsletters and track results so it's basically what you're we're describing and it hasn't taken off i'm also looking at spoken they went to white combinator they're in class of w21 so winter 21 does that mean they're still in it yeah that's like now um and they cut the company launched into so that's like not even now it's [ __ ] spring 21 i don't know how that works wait yeah what the hell that's guys lying it says w-21 no well it could be winter 21 january january 21 oh okay i gotcha i guess yeah not december january uh and it started in 2018 and i'm wondering why it hasn't taken off a little bit more because it's three years in you would think it would have a little bit more traction and so on surface i think this is a brilliant idea i'm wondering what's going on and why it's not kicking ass i think this is a fantastic idea all right uh i i like this idea a little better as the newsletter one because i think it's more accessible than podcasts but uh both are cool and we should ask ryan dies is your buddy right you should ask him like what's what's the deal why well i don't he's never told me this but ryan dice has loads of companies right so this is because of because this is pretty innovative you'd have to be all in on it i think to make it work and so i was wondering what's going on with something like this so if you're building this let us know if you're like no i want a project i want to build it this is one where if you're a credible person uh me and sam will invest in this i think to to get something like this built by the way um we have a new email it's called mfn at thehustle.com i'll give you access sean but basically um any because i get too many emails i think you do too so if you guys want to contact us and if you are building this mfm at thehustle.com uh so you can email us us if you're actually making that uh you want to go then another one yeah let's do another one all right so um crime walk okay what is this so i was i don't even remember what this was so basically there's like an air so airbnb has this experiences thing and uh you probably know much more about this and uh your wife works there and you're also i think the type that would do something like this so i saw this and i saw how much money it was making or i don't remember what it was exactly okay so if you go to airbnb experiences there was a experience and there's a in our dock there's a link to it just slightly below um where it's a retired nypd officer will guide you for a this is so cool so here's the description i'm just going to read it word for word first let me say that most gangster tours in new york are total bs this experience comes right from the horse's mouth no tour guide no filter get real stories while visiting notorious gang land locations as we walk from east village to little italy experiencing what it was like to associate to be an associate of new york's famous mafia families you'll hear first-hand accounts of the new york new york city mafia and crimes in new york and taste local cuisines so i i saw this i was like this is a such a good idea uh i i think i saw that this crime walk was making a lot of money so it was very successful which is not a surprise to me i i would do this if i was you know in new york this is this is great um but a couple of things kind of here's the business idea so first is this is cool quick reaction then i have an idea well on okay so this first of all i just sent this to my wife because we're moving to new york for a little while i said we're doing this second he charges around 120 to 130 depending on the date per person and in the description he says that he has had 8 000 guests so 123 times 8 000 is a million bucks exactly so a mill i think that's what i that's what originally caught my attention was here's who has built an experience i think that was my kind of curiosity who's built an airbnb experience that had made a million bucks right because this is a big platform certainly somebody's doing well uh and so so this is kind of how it caught my eye okay so what's the idea the idea is this is a cool thing for a cop to do in retirement i i told you we had that uh that police situation where i had to go do a shakedown we we brought a cop with us and became friends with that cop later and was getting to know you know as the first cop i really become friends with as an adult um and i loved her she was great and i said so i was like well um what you know how do cops can cops make more money because she was describing how hard it is to be a cop nowadays there's like kind of like a lot of cop backlash because of blm and all that stuff she's like what i'm a good cop and like also like budget cuts like defund the police budget cuts are happening all around and so anyways long story short i think this is a cool thing for a retired cop to do also could be applied to retired kind of anything anybody who has a cool job like whether you're a swat officer a you know military veteran firefighter or whatever it is i think there's a lot of people who a lot of people who are like me were like little weaklings that spend all of our days behind a desk and we want this like safe way to taste you know an adventure and like what the real tough world looks like and so that's why like spartan race and stuff that's why they do well and similarly i think that these like kind of crime walks would be would be cool so then i took it a little bit further well why don't people do this with more things so why don't you take every physical venue where something interesting is happening breweries do this right breweries say hey we got this brewery but we also have the side business of people come through they get a tour of a brewery they get to see how it's made they get to taste the beers they get to take some photos they get to buy our [ __ ] on the way out and they've turned brewery tours as a like additional income stream for breweries so why doesn't this happen for more things like when i visited uh you know the warehouse for my wife's you know ecommerce business i was fascinated this like this 80 000 square foot place you get to see all these forklifts coming around and how it works how fulfillment works when an order comes in how does it get put in a mailer how does it get taken out of here and so i think that for everything factories warehouses police stations firefighter stations i think they should all have this as a business vaynermedia did that where and you could well i don't know about cove anymore but prior i think it was like a 20 million dollar a year of business it would cost like 10 000 10 000 per person or per like couple and you and your co-founder or you and whoever can go to the vaynermedia thing and they're like head of people would just have a discussion with you and then eventually gary would come in for like half an hour and all you do is you learn how an agency works and you get to walk around the office and see like where the departments are and you could go to the eventbrite page and it would show you how many seats they had and how many were taken and i did that and i just did the math i'm like oh my gosh this might make like 10 to 20 a year if right like if seven of eight of the seats are actually full um it's actually that was 10 grand yeah it's called the the uh uh uh if you look at vaynermedia eventbrite you'll find it it was called so this is i'm an age i'm a small agency owner garyvee is my hero vaynermedia is like where we want to be someday i'll pay 10 grand to basically get to go check it out see how it works meet gary shake his hand uh spend 20 minutes there and then like leave is that basically it yeah it's called the vaynermedia daily digital deep buy deep dive and if you look it up on eventbrite youtube yeah it's a dumb name am i right uh abreu is that what it's called and so if you look up eventbrite vaynermedia you'll see it and you could look at the past events and you can see how full it is and you can see the price it's it's pretty ridiculous but like so i didn't look this up beforehand but i'll tell you another version of this that's cool um are you a basketball fan do you know who coach k is yeah duke guy i know i'm i'm i'm i'm not an idiot but i'm not a fan okay so the four days by the way it's called the four d's uh it's called the four d's uh vaynermedia four ds i guess that is daily digital deep dive okay cool so um so coach k who is the duke basketball coach he's the most famous college basketball coach probably of all time uh and he was the men's olympic coach for the dream the the latest dream teams or regime teams like lebron and kobe and all those guys so he's pretty popular guy and he does a thing every year called coach k's fantasy camp it's almost identical to what you're talking about and now you got my brain spinning that how many more of these are there and how many more should there be and uh maybe we need the my first million dream camp so here's how this works coach case fantasy camp you pay ten thousand dollars and you get to go who are these people they are you know duke students who like you know there's a bunch of duke students who are like kind of investors now ceos of companies and uh they were big basketball fans now they got a bunch of money they're kind of in their 40s or you know 50s and they pay to go to this thing what is it you go for the for i think a five-day program or something like that you go back to duke campus and you live like a player so you stay in the dorms i think or you know you stay kind of on campus or right next to campus um there's like a bus that basically brings you onto campus and you you come into cameron indoor stadium which is the duke basketball stadium it's like the hallowed ground and um coach k takes you through a camp where you you know you're on the court you're shooting you're doing the drills that the players do you get the motivational talk that coach k gives he brings in old players to come oh that's carlos boozer oh that's jj redick um you know you get autographs and kind of you know but but it's more intimate because it's 10 grand so there's you know a few hundred campers i think and uh so they actually get to meet those guys and actually hang with them and for the players it's cool too because these are all like ceos or high level hedge fund guys they actually kind of want this business network also and um you get to wear the jersey you get to go into the locker room they play the sounds when you come out and like you know you've got your dad bod like your fats coming out the side of the jersey here comes here comes duke and you get to run out and there's like no fans there because it's not real again um anyways this thing's awesome he must make a ton of money off this thing i haven't really done the math because i heard about this when i was in college my roommate was a manager on the team so he he was part of the kind of the team program so he would stay during the summers to be the the kind of the uber the shuttle bus driver for these guys and he's like i was like why are you doing this sounds lame like why do you want to do this he's like oh i make a killing in tips these guys will just hand me hundreds when they get out for the 5.5 minute ride of like from the from the dorm or the hotel to the to the gym he's like i'm getting 100 bucks from these guys every time i do one of these shuttles it's amazing and um and the network is great like i meet some of these guys they're like hi you know this guy started this this guy started that so i think this is cool and i wonder how many more people do this or could do this because it's a very interesting little i think you do it for every sport and and i'm so into this i don't know what i don't know what i could do it with but um i i'm on board here's here's a version of this if you're a hustler um okay so so if you're a hustler here's what you do you go to um grant cardone you go to you know people who are yes they've made it and they have a high profile but they actually don't make as they still need money right so like you can i don't think you could do this with lebron james necessarily but i think you could do this with a college football coach because college football coaches like you know at every program don't make tons of money or or a really famous high school coach yeah exactly or um it could be a ceo of a company or you know whatever and you basically create the same sort of fantasy camp uh mindset or the 4d tours and it's like hey i will run this whole thing for you i just want 20 of profits okay so here's what i'm going to ask of you when i bring people over at this time every week or once a year or whatever it is you come out you kiss babies and shake hands and let me do this and so it's a way to attach yourself to an influential program institution or person and create this business line uh you know from scratch because really you're just offering this to their uh their fans dude i think and this is actually what i've thought about doing because i enjoy using i enjoy physical work uh i whenever i'm done working here whenever i'm done i like before i start my next company i'm what i'm gonna do is i'm either i'm gonna go and read a book and i'm gonna master like a niche like crime in new york or um the gold rush in san francisco or something like that or i'm going to start a landscaping company something that i'm gonna have to be outside all day working really hard and i think i can turn it into a million dollar a year company like inside six months i truly believe and the reason why this fascinates me is because hey i i love it i love like being physically exhausted i enjoy that but also um because i think that far too many people are trying to make money on the internet which is cool and all when they could probably crush it and become quite wealthy by just doing some something outside that is totally like so it won't scale yadda yadda i'm like oh [ __ ] it dude who like do like you know first of all everything could scale at least a little bit and secondly who cares i would love to see somebody do manhood as a service okay what's manhood as a service so in this again same way that spartan race and tough mudder they're kind of like these like pseudo tough guy events that you can go do oh i did something hard outdoors i got muddy i got cut you know i climbed this mountain i got this headband and i drank a beer at the end you know you get your man card now if anybody who really knows knows that this is not a real man card this is a fake id but you know this is your mclovin it's pretty funny but that's what these are offering they're offering manhood as a service and um i would like to see somebody take this to the extreme so i'll give you the example uh brother aaron who comes on here he's coming here twice or something like that and people know him because people like him because he's kind of a nut like he comes on with conspiracies and rabbit holes and he just goes all in on things he has gone all in on like manhood he's sort of like dude we're all too soft so he trains like jiu jitsu and boxing and he just wants to do an amateur fight why because he's like i just want to see what i'm made of and i think you could take that concept and make it a weekend traveling circus it goes from city to city you just say step up and face some pain you want to see what it's like to get like kind of tortured you want to get can you take a punch can you get like like a tough mudder there's the electric shock at the end and you kind of want to know like what does that feel like um you know like can you go in this isolation tank and like could you last an hour i don't i don't know what the actual product is but i know it's a counter-intuitive thing it's like wait people are paying to get like kind of like do physical labor they have to like chop down this [ __ ] tree and they don't get picked up until they're done it's like yeah that's what this is it's like hard work slash pain slash like manhood like what did we used to have to do that we don't have to do anymore what's hardship that we are sheltered from because other people do it for us or machines do it for us or whatever and uh i think there's actually like a very big craving in society for um for those types of experts i totally agree i've been going boxing every friday and i just like love i'm like i need to get punched in the face so i can feel alive um like i gotta do it it's awesome like again like tough mudder you make it safe enough where the actual you the mass market is [ __ ] basically who don't actually want to go get punched like if you really wanted to go get a fight you can go do that so you need the people who want to have the experience but with padded walls with you know with with the with the gloves on where you're not actually gonna get like severely hurt in any way but you get to experience like what is your level of toughness grit pain tolerance uh physical endurance physical ability what is your max um like i think survivors should do this i'm a big survivor nerd and i always see these challenges and i would love to do them and like if you're a survivor okay back to the camera jeff probst this idea is for you you're survivor you're you're i don't know you're on season 42 or something like that you're not getting any younger the show is not getting that many new users here newcastle new viewers here's what you need to do we need to create the survivor world tour where you go city to city and you set up the survivor events that you've seen on tv and you see can you do it can you hang what will this do survivor super fans have a deeper way to connect with you they'll pay you know shut up and take my money because i love this show you can get the ex players to come out because they ain't doing [ __ ] anymore right they're just doing cameos so they'll come out they'll do it just to extend their lifeline of fame you'll get new people who will go with their friends to go try this thing they'll get into the survivor universe and then when i'm watching the show it's like dude i did that one where you have to hang on to this poll for as long as you can and it's an amusement park or a carnival or a fair but branded by one of these shows or maybe multiple shows that get together and do this what do you think of my idea in yeah i mean it's almost like um it's like a tv version of disneyland yes yes exactly you take the ip from tv and you make disneyland out of it and as or or you know uh uh yeah like any kind of carnival if if they had like do you remember you know that tv show the challenge that both you and like so sean and my wife sarah like do i remember the show i watched last week yes yeah they like text each other about this thing called the challenge i don't i don't know how it ended i mean i see it in the background when sarah's watching it but they they love it i thought you're a fan you didn't even watch the finale if i don't have anything to do i'll sit with her and watch it i i have literally no idea how it ended uh i think the ending was like last week right yeah um if they have like a challenge location where you could do i know there's like a famous one called like wall brawl or something like that paul brawl yeah like if they like we would have gone let me describe hull brawl for people who don't know because you know there's not many the crossover between people who care about business and tech and watch the challenge you know it's a lonely lonely island so halbro is a imagine a narrow hallway like two feet wide it's just plexiglas uh it's a two plexiglas things with a two foot gap in between and on one side there's one person wearing football pads another person's standing the other side and then the guy says go and you have to run straight at each other in this narrow hallway you smash into each other and then it's like whoever gets out to the other side and rings the bell first wins and it's the famous thing there but this is exactly what i would do in my kind of manhood as a service fair or my or my tv fair which is yeah you can do hall brawl come step up sign the waiver step up and you get to do whole brawl you get to experience this we there's video cameras already positioned everywhere and you get to share this content onto instagram uh at the end of it just like the museum of ice cream just like tough mudder it's due today for photo opportunities i've all right i've got we we're probably gonna have to wrap it up soon but i've got two stories that i'm gonna bring up the first is i was at my friend nick ray's house the other day and i met the founder of museum of ice cream um and i told him we talked about him and he was like i know and i and we were never disrespectful about him but i think we were like not bullish on the idea so we'll have to i think we were both like this is a great business idea but hey if you go kind of underwhelming i think that was like our both of our like true user opinion of it so we're gonna have to have him come on but second have you heard of museum hack no what is this so i went to my friend nick's house the other day and i've been buddies with him for a while and he's got this website called museumhack.com he recently sold the business but this is just another example of one of these tour things that we've been discussing so he i don't even know if he knows a lot about art i don't know what his background is actually but he likes he just enjoys museums and so he built this business that was making two million a year in sales and you would pay him or eventually he would train people in a variety of cities and you would pay fifty to a hundred dollars i forget the plus admission to the museum and in new york the museum's free and he would give you a custom tour of a museum and explain you explain to you the the background behind the different paintings and different pieces of art but you would do it in a fun way so if you go if you google museum hack the meta description is museum hack [ __ ] awesome museum tours so it was like clearly like this like young hip you know whatever thing and companies would pay money to send their employees there and they do it in six cities i think so they have people in la san francisco new york and then a few other cities and it was a 2 million a year business and this is all that he did and it was very successful it was a lot of work to set up but it kind of ran itself after a while and pretty simple and straightforward and pretty amazing it's called museum hack that's the business that's cool i like that one um you had two stories is that the one is that both or is that one that was both okay that's both can i do one more idea we want to try to slip it in all right so this is related to related to manhood as a service more like back to the roots which i think kind of like what you were talking about was like i'm gonna buy a farm i'm gonna like own the farm and i'm gonna like offer tours of the farm and let people come like farm with me uh or a ranch or something like that right anytime i rent the chicken i'm looking at the site now rent the chicken is what i want to talk about so what i saw this little thing that showed that that's talked about how the chicken rental business has been booming during the pandemic okay what is this people are renting chickens like pet it's like a pet in a box so chicken kind of owners breeders i don't know who real farm people basically are taking chickens and basically saying hey sam who uh you know lives in austin and you know has his house do you want a chicken coop in your backyard here's what you get hey there's two chickens back there cool you kind of got a little pet i i'll bring the coop i bring the feed i bring the instructions i i kind of boot you up i let you know how it works they're gonna lay like six eggs uh you know a a a day or whatever like you're gonna get fresh eggs that are awesome from your own coop and you got this pet uh like you get to talk to them and pet them and like i know for example my daughter is like 18 months old like kids love animals and so i want to get her like some kind of animal soon that's like like because we have cows that come in our backyard or like back to our fence and it's like her favorite thing in the whole world just like cows couch and she says like you know khao si mu kelsey moo like means like i want to go see the cows they go moo and so i take her to the fence and she sees them and she's like wants to touch them and it's like her favorite thing our friend ramon had a little chicken coop in his backyard he had three of them three chickens back there and his son like liked it and they used to go out there and you know feed the chickens and get eggs from them and so this is booming so they're all like sold out so all the chicken rental companies can't get a chicken right now they're all like totally booked the demand during the during the pandemic like tripled i think it's still small numbers because they were like oh yeah demand triple last year we did 70 70 we had 70 chickens to rent and now we have like 200 chickens to rent so it's like that's still not that many coops that you're renting out pretty amazing but i'll call this my this is my new segment called blue collar side hustle i may never do this segment again but at least for this no we're going to do that that's a good one blue collar blue collar side hustle this is a way to make a few thousand dollars episode this whole episode is blue collar side hustles i think actually cool so so we talk about side hustles where it's like oh make a newsletter build an audience build a job board build a website that does this do drop shipping blah blah no no blue collar side hustles things you could just do with your bare hands make money with your bare hands so here's how it works whatever city you're in there's probably demand for these chicken rentals where you are too if all these other ones are sold out uh there's probably demand in those cities and in nashville and in florida and in la and in everywhere so rent some coops basically go get some chickens and start renting them out to people who want to be connected with nature have a little pet in their backyard that's low maintenance and get some fresh eggs so i think this is a great idea as a simple way that you could be making i don't know what it is you know five to ten grand a month of side hustle income through your blue collar side hustle dude and this website rent the chicken they also have a thing called buy the eggs or something like that and you can find out where the so rent the chicken yeah they put you a thing near you and then they have a thing where you can find out where the nearest one is and you can buy the fresh eggs from your which is cool right so you can go farm to table but you're just in the city and you're just getting it from somebody who lives two miles away they also do this with schools which i think is again smart because kids love this schools and offices hey are you a school in office great we can do a six-week program where you get chickens for six weeks you guys get to name them take care of them pet them blah blah take you know kids are gonna have fun and then we move on which back when i was in school we had the same we had like a class pet for like you know everybody got to take them home for two weeks or something like that um you know so we had that you have like a beekeeper thing or like you're a beekeeper you have bees bees and honey maybe bees and honey is like another little genre besides chickens but i think anything where it's a simple low maintenance pet that is unorthodox and ideally provides a little bit of food you can eat so eggs honey something like that i i think that that is a really cool fun thing to do again dude your growth you were working on growth i said i got to find something good and then i just closed my eyes and started typing buttons and this came to me this is uh very cool so if rent the chicken is not okay so it's here's the price for houston houston's near san francisco they deliver to you for free it's only 285 for a five-week rental february to october they deliver and set it up for free you get seven eggs that are gonna uh be hatched you get a box i think you get one chicken this is so interesting 60 bucks a week right 60 bucks a week to have you know a ticket or two in your backyard making eggs oh rented chicken rent the chicken is cool i'm into rent the chicken i went to um a party the other day and it was they had a backyard petting zoo and like a petting zoo delivery service kids party at an adult's party it was an adult's party and they had it was basically all the backyard no it just means they they have chickens they have a guinea pig and i think that's oh and rabbits and uh that's what this reminds me of uh rent the chicken backyard petting zoos i'm into all this [ __ ] man i like all this stuff this is this is a good one i actually think this is something i might sign up for but they're not in austin um my but my friend who had a chicken he said the eggs looked different but they didn't taste different but i would feel a lot better eating backyard eggs than store eggs for sure um can i then let me switch gears real quick how do you stay focused because when i'm doing this so i'm like i'm all in on podcasts right now like that's all i think about that's all i'm it's almost it's almost all i work i work on i have 200 unread texts i've got hundreds of voicemails i get phone calls from like salespeople selling me crap my email is ruined twitter sucks my slack is constantly beeping it is so hard to get the zone in focus how do you do it um well i would say this i am not a details person in general so i would say one of the ways to stay focused or one of the ways to get [ __ ] done i'll instead of saying stay focused i get [ __ ] done is to correctly identify like you said the 80 20 of any project so for you you were like for the podcast okay what do i ultimately need to do i need to get people to smash the subscribe button so how do i get more people to hit subscribe today right so you you focused on the thing that matters and you threw away the rest and then you like did the what's the one step i can take today to like get that to happen more and then tomorrow i'll come up with another one and the next day i'll come up with another one so that's you didn't say it in so many words but that's how i operate i identify what is the thing that if i just did this one thing it's going to get me 80 percent of the return or the reward or the impact and then i try to just set out okay today i gotta get this one outcome done and that one outcome might have like five tasks five like subtasks underneath but i'm like okay if i can correctly identify the high impact thing and then secondly if i can just narrow it down you know make it a memorable like i don't do a to-do list it's one thing that i can remember in my head all day that this is the one outcome i gotta get done i'll find a way to get it done it won't leave my brain i don't let my brain get cluttered by all the ten other things and this bothers the hell out of my wife or like right now my mom's staying with us right she's helping out with the baby and she's like oh you got to get your car insurance thing done oh and hey did you know your trash thing we should upgrade the thing so you get the bigger bins because your bins are overflowing and like all these people texted you because it was your birthday on sunday did you reply to any of them like no i i didn't do any of those things i don't plan to do any of those things none of those things are in line with my chief aim right now so like i'm gonna like focus on that and it doesn't matter what the chief aim is right like we just had this baby my chief aim was like i'm gonna be so helpful with this baby because like i can see my wife this is like she's gonna drown otherwise this is too hard to have two kids under 18 months old i need to be like mr mr helpful and so i like went all in on mr hopeful but if it's a project like let's say growing the podcast that's what i would do identify the 80 the thing that will give me 80 of the impact make it every day just choose one high impact thing to do like it might be get booked on other people's podcasts other big podcasts i know that's going to drive attention cool i'll only do that thing i won't do anything else so what you're describing uh i actually wrote about this i have this article called i'll do it later why you shouldn't worry about procrastinating and it was written in 2015 so i wrote those six years ago and basically and i stole a lot of ideas from other people so i won't take i don't want to act like i invented this but there's basically three types of procrastination there's the first type which is you do nothing and that type is easy a lot of people suffer from that and that's what you want to avoid you don't want to do number one the second one is doing something less important than what you should be doing a lot of people do that too and that's basically when you uh you know you have to do this uh school homework but you play video games instead right no no it's like you clean your room it's like you you do some false productive thing when you didn't need to do that you should have been studying for the test tomorrow yeah it's called bit it's busy work and it's meaningless and that's actually the worst type of procrastination because you actually think you're doing something productive in reality you're not um and that's really dangerous but the third type of procrastination i think we should all embrace and it's actually the good type of procrastination so it is when you when you do something that's more important than the stuff you should be doing and that's actually what you just described so getting your car insurance is actually important but what's more important let's say this relates to business it's just making a ton of money to the point where that car insurance kind of like is it's you understand that it's less important and the best example of this is like the brilliant scientist who accidentally wears two left shoes or who forgets to shower or who doesn't take their trash out is taking your trash out important it's important but it's far less important than creating the theory of relativity you know what i mean and so actually biology said something about this the other day because we said what's your day like and he goes i um you know he's like we said kind of like dude you're thinking about all these topics like the future of x and the you know the the future of y and the past of z these are heavy like these are meaty topics to think about like how do you do that every day and he was like actually that's not so hard for me that feels like play like i enjoy doing that what's hard for me is remembering that i have a you know i have a call i got to be on in 10 minutes and like stopping what i'm doing getting there on time and remembering to go do that thing is like because i get completely engrossed in what i'm doing and that becomes easy but what becomes hard is like normal life and i was like yeah you're you are the absent-minded scientist who's got like his desk is like you know totally messy it's like to someone else it looks like chaos but you know that you're piecing these things together and you don't care about organizing your desk right now it's just not what's important to you and the thing is is that logically we all know that the third type of procrastination is good and you should actually embrace it but the world basically tries to beat that out of you and they try to totally hate you in this corner and make you vanilla and they say but sean you have to do your insurance or you have to text these people back and the answer is often or it should be like but why actually it's far more important if i do x y and z and i have found this extreme question but helpful question to ask yourself is uh will the tasks that i'm working on right now be mentioned or be part of me being mentioned in my obituary and if it's not then you're procrastinating don't don't don't don't do that work on the thing that will be mentioned on your obituary or has a chance of uh yeah like i actually got into argument with my wife yesterday about this because we have some bill that's like we have like a 700 late fee on it and she was like oh my god we're so wasteful like why didn't you just pay this bill i told you about it i put it on your desk and i was like uh and i was like yes you did put it on my desk but i was so knee-deep in learning about defy the last three days and hey guess what like we've made you know sixty eight thousand dollars in three days on in this defy trade that i was making and um like that's cash in the bank now like could we not worry about the 700 thing and so for me it's so black and white but she comes from a totally different value set which is like it feels worse to her to take something that was avoidable um that you could have just taken care of that would signify adulthood uh that you're on top of your bills and um and for me it's the exact opposite my values are you know focus on the things that matter and like let other [ __ ] fall on the ground and like that stuff is on the ground for a reason i just hop skip and jump around it um and so we are so different and we constantly get into these arguments and i feel like financially i'm on the right side of history but um you know in the house i'm definitely losing rounds every time we do these battles so if your wife is listening to this and she does by the my wife does which is weird um but if show her this episode and to anyone else out there who like fits in this like scientist type of forgetful scientist thing where they forget birthdays or they do this and they do this but they're really actually focused on like some interesting thing that will actually change their life or others lives let it slip let it slide do not give in to this societal pressure of like having to focus on these unimportant things because you should instead be focused on things that actually matter your health whatever you're working on in your family everything else is pretty much [ __ ] yes so can i get one can i give my last last piece on this but i know we're going to move on in a second but i have i have two minutes on this which is i made a choice a long time ago all right the way i realized how this works is there are people who are pre there's unproductive people they're just lazy they don't get [ __ ] done okay you don't want to be one of them then in the productive class there's two types of people there's efficient productive and there's effective productive i'm effective productive you're effective productive there's a lot of people who we work with in fact we have to hire people that are efficient productive what they do is they get a high number of tasks done and done well but they don't necessarily correctly identify the one or two tasks that are going to have disproportionate rewards and they don't go overboard on those tasks so if you look at us well that's what we're going to do whether it's project selection or even within a project we will find the one or two things that will drive the most returns we will go give that 120 180 percent and then we will do zero percent on the other things whereas another person might say and and by the way that might all happen in a two-hour burst of work in the day or a four-hour late night binge uh and the other hours of the day were completely you know we were scatterbrained we were doing other [ __ ] and it didn't matter there's other people who say i'm gonna work from nine to five i'm gonna make every hour count i'm gonna get a whole bunch of things done i feel good because i plowed through my to-do list i was so efficient i used every hour properly and i got a large number of tasks done um and i you know i tied up all these loose ends that's efficient productive so decide which one you're going to be both have pros and cons i think for a ceo entrepreneurial type effective productive is better um or at least i've seen that's a more common path to success i should say so that's one the second thing is just like you said that there's procrastination um i you you left the cody sanchez podcast last time but at the end we talked about this where she she was talking about finding mentors and i stole this novel quote which is so true when people think they need a mentor to go do their project or to like start their startup they're looking for a mentor first it's just an advanced form of procrastination um you will find mentors along the way you'll find people who are super helpful who have experience they'll guide they'll open doors they'll guide you but uh that is not what's stopping you from making progress right now and if you are looking for mentors before you do the thing uh you are procrastinating you're just doing it in a way that other people can't point and laugh at because you're not just eating cheetos and watching tv as your form of procrastination and the final point the final point is there is a class of things and right now for example i i do this list i i've done i've put this in my frameworks pdf that if you if you go sign up for my my newsletter on seanpuri.com this is the first thing i send you is my frameworks pdf i have this like iron cross or it's called an eisenhower matrix it's basically like a a two crossed lines and the up and down line is basically impact so low impact to high impact and the left to right is urgent and non-urgent and so on a given day you want to do the things that are urgent and high impact but what it but so that's obvious but then what do you do next and once you do those two things what do you do next do you go to the bucket that is urgent but low impact or high impact non-urgent and what most people do 90 95 people including myself on many days is we'll do the urgent low-impact thing we'll pay that bill we'll call that person back we will um you know whatever it is uh type those loose ends because they're due today or they're due yesterday but there's a whole other batch of things that are important and non-urgent they just sit there like ticking time bombs and the great quote around this is that you know what's important but non-urgent um becomes urgent very quickly and what ends up you know it becomes urgent when it's too late uh so like for me right now this is setting up my tax strategy my overarching tax strategy how do i manage do i need an estate do i need to trust how am i going to do all this i don't know about that [ __ ] it kind of makes my mind bend a little bit it's easier for me to just avoid that because there's no like there's no specific day where i have to get that set up but every day that i don't i'm not doing something that's a you know high impact or a very large large impact thing and so think about the things you do on this axis and then try not to just avoid those things that are non-urgent and high impact because that's actually where a lot of value gets driven i uh i'm doing all that [ __ ] now i can't stand it so i agree i think we had a good little rant on procrastination on uh productivity okay great good episode that's it that's a wrap abray you give us the grade people hated when we put the grade up front i got like five messages being like i prefer it uh i prefer at the end all right that's good all right everyone i asked you to either leave a review or subscribe and send me proof and hundreds maybe even north of a thousand people did i'm not gonna read all your names right now but i'm gonna get to everyone eventually but i'm gonna give a few shout out or i wanna give a shout out to a handful of people that did it so uh here's everyone who subscribed and sent a screenshot if you wanna get a shout out you could do the same my

most people should not be out there trying to build the next facebook and i think it's kind of [ __ ] up that a lot of people try to tell people that's what they should do most people want maslow's hierarchy of needs right you want your family taken care of you want food on the table you want to be able to do the [ __ ] you want to do on the weekends and that's it and so i like the portfolio actually better of a portfolio of small bets i think of buying businesses a lot like i think about buying stocks i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back sam you showed up i thought uh i thought you were too hungover from last night's pod that went till two in the morning uh to show up today dude it went later for me i mean i didn't go to bed till four what time did you what time what time was it over for you it ended but my brain didn't turn off so like i don't even know if i slept last night i straight so we so cody we had um biology on the pod yesterday and uh i don't know if you know how yeah kind of a real smart smart dude and he definitely um you know has like a ton of different ideas and thoughts and he's like super super smart on a math perspective science uh you know technically for computer science uh and so he was you know rattling off a bunch of interesting things but when he left and i'm going to sleep and it's just you know you know i'm sitting there i'm in bed my dog's in the bed and like my mind is like making up a straight up i was just making up like scientific theories in its head like you know that state where you're dreaming but you're you're like lucid dreaming or whatever you're like kind of like half asleep and so i was half asleep but my mind was like oh but then the vector has to go to the scalar and then it has to you know the order of magnitude and i was like then i'd wake up what the [ __ ] am i talking like what the [ __ ] is going through my head this is not even this gibberish this is a scientific gibberish and that straight up happened like the whole night so i'm not a great be prepared to be underwhelmed in comparison to him today i think is the moral of the story well he uh he's just like like we've had a i think we've had one other person on the podcast like i guess michael saylor could be this but i i for sure think that uh rahul from superhuman was like this but there's like these a handful of people who we've talked to and you know people say like oh that person's a genius they're not they don't really mean it but if we define genius as just like a certain iq i would bet a lot of money that that he was the highest iq person that i've ever had a conversation with and it was very obvious and he actually was quite he tried really hard to hide it in that he tried to act nice and friendly and there was times where he was like sorry you guys probably don't understand that let me try to re-explain and that was that was actually pretty cool but he just his he's just smarter than me like his he's his oven just burns hotter and i there's nothing i could do to try to understand that like i remember one time i didn't want to embarrass sean but like biology was telling something and he used up he used math metaphor he's like he's like what i try to find is the dot product between me and this and i was like dot product i remember that like in eighth grade i heard this phrase 15 years ago didn't understand it then never ever thought about it again and then he's referencing it for like the way he thinks about something he's like you know so i try to find the dot product and i was like [ __ ] i don't know what that means wait but he what like he went from math so he was talking about math to talk about an idea and then he moved to like uh this one battle like some type of chemistry and then he went to the battle of the balls and he goes to shot he goes sean you know like you know like it's a battle of the bulge right um and john was like yeah and he's i don't think he knew what the battle of the ball was yeah anyway it was an interesting podcast but this could you imagine how like you felt like that last night sean could you imagine being in his head every day or at like a dinner with normal people he probably wants to kill himself yeah we were we even asked him about that stuff uh we were like you know we asked a whole bunch of questions that were like i hope not even like condescending but we're kind of like were you always like this and like what did your family think like were you like an oddball to them or are they like was this like totally normal because i've never met somebody like you so i want to know like what's your life like what do you do for fun like uh you know how does this all work and so we asked him a bunch of goofy questions like that actually unfortunately the best the very best part was at the end after the recording ended and we just kind of after a three and a half hour podcast we then shot the [ __ ] for like 30 minutes and it was great and his guard was totally down and uh that was awesome and then sam started helping him with his newsletter tips and he was like taking notes and he was like oh this is this is great this is awesome stuff and like that was ironically the best and simplest part of the podcast and we have like three and a half hours of like good stuff but in a i mean the way you said it his oven burns hotter than ours uh and so you know i didn't feel like we were able to really add too much to the conversation or really like steer it because i was like riding a bronco that i didn't know how to ride basically it's too smart for me i love that can't wait to hear it anyways so uh with that out of the way welcome to our guest uh cody's cody's here so uh cody i guess like how do you explain yourself uh when you kind of introduce yourself because you have a newsletter that's pretty cool you know uh this country and cash flow newsletter you have an investment uh fund and business there you have built and owned businesses i think majority share in some businesses so like what do you how do you describe this jack of all trades so hi i'm cody here's what i do what do you say well i think if i'm on an airplane sitting next to somebody i usually tell them i'm a sales person so i don't have to talk too much uh but in a conversation where i was trying to impress somebody you know i'd probably say i'm an investor i am a private equity investor i run a fund that's about a couple hundred million bucks focused on cannabis before that i did emerging markets couple billion dollars raised there and and now i write about all the things i wish i knew when i was first figuring out anything to do with this green language of money and i do that at contrary in thinking and i mailed the two but i think these days that's not that weird there's a ton of vcs not so many pe investors out there probably that write about investing and share their ideas and i kind of think that's probably the future and where it's going going forward you you i didn't know that i knew that you had the newsletter but so you have you run a 200 million there's five partners but yeah we have a 200 million dollar cannabis private equity fund we invest in companies that do like 10 to 50 million dollars in revenue largely it's called entourage effect capital and uh we've invested in 67 companies thus far some cool ones um that you all would know i think there's been six unicorns in there thus far so you know um you guys maybe know gti green thumb industries acreage canopy growth uh cura leaf i don't know if you're big weed connoisseurs you know them and then uh and then we have a smaller fund that's about 20 million bucks that's for micro pe so that's just me and a couple other partners money where we buy small businesses and that's if if we'd sort of fancy and not fancy i guess trendy uh then the other one are super boring and things that you know your your father did when you were growing up and you didn't tell people about and that's like uh give us examples we're talking laundromats we're talking um what are we talking about plumbing businesses what are you looking at actually the first one was a plumbing deal we started it because my uncle ebb uh he had a five million dollar business let me make sure i get the numbers right that was doing about two to three million dollars in profit and he was old you know 70s ish and he was a shared crop he grew up in a sharecropping family um didn't know anything about the business world and when he came to uh retire he didn't know anything about m a so instead of selling the company he basically just wound it down and uh and you know he took a company that had two to three million dollars in profit and just just you know let everybody go and and sort of wound on the business and i thought that was a real waste and so um we realized wait a second there's actually like a business model here it's called pe i've been doing it for 12 years at goldman and vanguard and state street and all these different firms why don't why don't they apply this to these micro sized businesses anything below three mil and uh instead of us making a bunch of money for other people we could make money for ourselves so we ended up taking an offshoot of ebb homes plundering you can look it up it's in phoenix and we bought a another plumbing company rolled it in sold that one that was a little tiny company and and then i've done it for a bunch of others and now we own laundromats we own a podcast production company uh we own some lawn care businesses we own a professional services business it's in the cleaning space so a slew of tiny sort of boring businesses and most of the time i don't operate any of them there's somebody else that's an operator in them or we place somebody in the business uh we love this model me and sam both uh a couple of our best friends started a kind of micro pe firm we invested in and i think have been i don't know sam i don't know how how closely you track them but we've been i've been learning a ton as they look at all these different deals and it just seems like there's a huge generational shift of people who are aging out of their business and need to hand it off the kids don't want to take it over necessarily or aren't able to or whatever and so basically the boomers handing over businesses there's just like all these businesses that are beautiful five fifteen million dollars a year profitable super steady book of business um and you can you could buy these out like super yeah it's like a 65 70 year old mom and dad whose kids went to a good school and they're like uh i'd rather work at facebook than run the moving company please i don't want to do that uh so and they're like all right what do we do now 100 uh and that's what these guys are buying it's going great uh like i get their updates they're making a lot of money and so yeah good for me can you can you draw a quick line so like let's do a quick uh hop through the resume because so people because i think where you're at now is super interesting anytime i meet somebody who's in a really interesting spot now i'm like how the hell did you get there uh so you said something like goldman but like without going into the details of like i did this and here's how it went just sort of like i went to school thinking i'd do this first job was here second job was here third job was here now i'm here like can you give us that shirt and sweet uh so i went to school totally unrelated to anything financial i'm not really a finance nerd at the core um i started off in human uh trafficking and drug smuggling as a journalist not doing it but along the u.s mexico border so um so i was covering things like uh you know old people being left behind at the border and um you know went with a couple coyotes and actually saw what the process was like and anyway super young at the time i thought i was going to change the world to realize like ah you know britney spears shaves her head and nobody cares about these stories so maybe there's a different way and so anyway uh so moved from uh journalism to had my little quarter life crisis and decided that maybe i wanted to understand finance because my last name sanchez all these people's last name was sanchez suarez whatever the case may be and i was in a very different position than they were so i was like what's the difference why are they there and i'm here and i think the only difference is green it's not actually even that i'm american and so went to from there i got recruited to go to vanguard accelerated development program saw a bunch of parts of finance didn't understand any of it but journalists we asked a lot of questions so it's pretty decent at that so asked a lot of questions got from vanguard they're all about passive investing right so create an index that was at the very beginning etfs and create an index and replicate and replicate and replicate and i thought that was cool but not that sexy or fun so i went to goldman and i wanted to understand active how do we do ipos what do these alternatives look like because they're more margin that went from gold men to state street ran international investment business for state street at the time and then left did a jv with a company called first trust and built out their international portion so i grew the business to a couple billion in latin america and uh and basically we sold products to big pensions sovereign wealth funds etc and then after that business i was ready to exit myriad of reasons and looking for the next emerging markets uh and i started invested in cannabis a few years back but real quiet i wasn't sure my mom would approve and uh and then went full in as a partner into eec what's your um um what's your heritage you said that you're are you i you're talking about the point my father's half so i'm half spanish half mexican are you catholic yes me too so a mexican catholic mother probably wasn't a fan of uh oh yeah she was thrilled maybe this baby's a weed financier she was really excited about it um just making daddy proud but um you know i think once we kind of understood i mean here's my pitch on cannabis but once we kind of understood the you know psychoactive portion of it and the benefits for those who are overusing opioids like i got her around to it but certainly up front she was not thrilled about that but that's when you know right when people think you're a little crazy for doing something there's usually at least some opportunity left otherwise all the smart people would have moved first and i'm not smarter than anybody else i'm just better at maybe finding some early emerging markets people won't go into yet and i thought you would be a great guest for two reasons a i went on your thing and you were so prepared uh i'm not anywhere near as prepared for this as you were for me unfortunately but i knew enough which was like oh she's great at talking and uh which is like half the battle and then the other half is like oh wait she's like wicked smart with a bunch of industries that i think people don't know a ton about so micro pe i know there's a lot of people interested but for most people it's a little bit daunting they don't understand how to identify the business how do you value them how do you buy them what do you do after you buy them that sort of thing and then same thing with cannabis uh people kind of know it's a big market but don't spend you know if you're not spending every day in that world you don't know how it's going how what's what's been growing and so you sent us a bunch of things so you sent us ideas on the micro pe side you sent us ideas on the canvas side and then you sent us some controversial thoughts sam where do you want to start uh of those three uh the ideas particularly the she posted something in trends about mailbox mailboxes which so like you just have like five or eight different things that i think are interesting they're not like huge home runs but they're small business entrepreneur like stuff [ __ ] that like an immigrant who came from nothing like would start and then eventually did that for 30 years and they would have like a [ __ ] empire let's wrap it up let's rapid fire them and here's how we'll do it uh you sent us this bullet point list i'm just gonna say the phrase and you'd be like okay so here's what i'm thinking and then if we just want to switch if i'm like okay that's great i'm just gonna throw another one at you and then you go from there i think you'll be able to volley these pretty well all right let's do that one mailbox money what are you what are you thinking about here so this is pack and ship centers so basically think fedex ups except get rid of the franchise fees because that's 25 of your your profit off the top and instead you just put you know sam and sean's shipping center on the front of it and what this is that i didn't realize my friend lisa did it i'm always curious for my people who make money in ways that are repeatable since i'm not smart enough like biology or whatever his name is to create the next tesla instead i just want a bunch of stuff that cash flows now um and so with this you know how everybody's obsessed with storage units like everybody builds these storage centers and that's been like a sexy thing right and and that's really just a riff on everybody was obsessed with multi-family and apartment beforehand they're like going smaller and smaller and smaller but still trying to get as much profit as possible well that's what packing ships are so essentially the money is not in the taping of boxes and the stuffing of stuffing to make sure stuff doesn't break it's actually in the little mailboxes in the front uh oh i was gonna ask you what do you think of this po box rental so at first i like the trend which is you're buying a box of real estate and you want like kind of these low operation you know rental units so okay self storage but now you should shrink the self storage unit instead of being you know 100 square foot little room you're shrinking it down into a one square foot box that you're renting out for 20 bucks and what you were saying so let's just do the bathroom quick on this you're saying 200 boxes in a location roughly is that right 200 would be what you don't want that's ups fedex go a thousand okay okay okay gotcha okay that now the math works so a thousand boxes average fifteen dollars a month of renting out the po boxes and how do you get customers to like what does she do to get what is your friend lisa do to get customers how does she acquire these po box tennis well i the smartest way what i talked to her doing she built the first one that took a year and a half to become profitable because she had to do what you were just talking about it's not really that complex of a business it's ads so ppc it's dropping actual hard mailings in the surrounding neighborhood it's things like she does like a book set up out front little pop-ups for the neighborhood where you can like you know free packing if you ship this day all that kind of stuff those squiggly arm things you know that you put outside of a new unit all that stuff and then uh she uh but but the second store i told her to buy and so what she did is went out and bought an already an existing store that had customers and then just up sold them and that's a much easier way to do it and so you buy the store for about two to three x profit her second store she got for about 1.5 x retiring uh owner and then she was able to take that business and sort of double the revenue for that one uh i like this idea i actually might steal this idea because um i just rented out a big warehouse for my wife's uh business and one thing we could do is just put a bunch of these mailboxes in into that space and uh and just actually offer this as a sort of a simple way to take advantage of a small footprint of real estate yeah i think you have to decide what type of human you are like if you are the type of human that has a capability to build up a really big business and that's what you in fact want to be a ceo of a puzzle or to be a ceo of an even bigger company then i think the roi on that is potentially more interesting long-term you're not going to get the same type of multiples with these tiny businesses but here's the thing most people are not like the three of us and i don't even know if we'd all be in the same category we're all different in the way we've built things most people should not be out there trying to build the next facebook and i think it's kind of [ __ ] up that a lot of people try to tell people that's what they should do most people want maslow's hierarchy of needs right you want your family taken care of you want food on the table you want to be able to do the [ __ ] you want to do on the weekends and that's it and so i like the portfolio actually better of a portfolio of small bets i think of buying businesses a lot like i think about buying stocks so how can i get a little portfolio of them with somebody running or operating them so that my risk is diversified and you're right it takes more time but if what you're really going for is i want to make you know two hundred thousand three hundred thousand five hundred thousand a million bucks a year and that that is my goal not to change the world there's so many better ways to do it than do a startup in my opinion yeah i'm 100 with you on that uh i think that build versus build verse buy is so slanted towards build because building sounds sexy building sounds like virtuous it's what the media talks about and it's really unfortunate because i know a lot of people that would have been really happy with 250k a year of profits um and low maintenance low headache and um and unfortunately they get sucked into either one of two paths it's like i guess i'll do the startup thing because i want to be entrepreneur i want to be kind of my own boss uh so then i gotta like do this from scratch find product market fit like damn that's hard and the other path is like ah that's that sounds really hard i'm just gonna stick at this job and um and you know i'll be an employee for the next you know 25 years and never really get that freedom because i'm sort of on their schedule i'm basically renting my time out to this company and so the the bypass versus build or join i think bi gets criminally underrated right now but i think it's changing like we have andrew wilkinson on the podcast a lot and one of the reasons he's so popular is that when he says what he does there's a hell of a lot of people out there who are like [ __ ] i want to do that that sounds fun uh that sounds like an easier path than the one i'm on right now and so i think it's quite appealing yeah sam you want to jump to one of these other ones that sounds interesting to you we got i see a bunch that i know you'd like tiny homes buying distressed assets for zero dollars laundromats which one you want to do oh no we got to tell you sam the audio's gone again okay sam has uh peaced out the technical difficulties have overcome him and he cannot continue on he is he is out of the game uh okay i'll do one uh so i want to talk about just buying distressed assets for zero dollars is this something you've done or why did you bring this up on the list yeah so this one is one i've done um and actually there's an example of it i'll give you the actual example so i have a friend brittany who owns a bunch of gyms and not a bunch she owns two and they're like you know like the gyms that um a lot of women go to where they have you know set classes and you know they all get in and work together it's kind of like women's crossfit but not with big weights anyway so she owns a couple of those like shapes without the franchise basically exactly so um she was telling me that a bunch of her friends their businesses pilates studios bar whatever were going out of business right during the pandemic and um what was fascinating to me is she was like so i'm buying some equipment you know i feel bad for them i'm helping them out i'm like the way we got to do this is think about those businesses they're going under and they're worth now zero to the market but they have value so you know they're not getting anything out of the client roster that they have all the goodwill that they've built up so what we decided to do was reach out to some of these gym owners and basically say hey you know i'm really sorry i know you're going through this terrible time what if we could help annuitize you a little bit where you could get some revenue off of the business that you're about to close for xero and instead we can do a rev share and so i own a business right now we'll transition over your clients from your business to mine very carefully very thoughtfully but give them a new home and then for every client that we bring over from you i'll pay you out on it for a year or i'll pay you out on for six months at x amount and 24 months at y amount however you want to structure it but this way you actually make money while you're closing your clients have a new house and we have new clients and we can serve them and we're friends and you like me anyway and so this business what to me what's fascinating is nobody's doing this that i know of like i if i owned any business i would be out there right now for every business closing on yelp sixty percent of the businesses on yelp that close temporarily close per permanently so i would be out there right now going after every one of their client lists even if they were unrelated and doing discounts and coupon codes giving a rev share to the owner who probably could use it and taking their clients base and that's how i would buy distressed assets i wouldn't spend a dime i love that i think that's great uh if it's basically you're picking up the assets and none of the liabilities so you're not buying the business and then having the rent and then you know having to bring that business back up you're basically saying what is the what is remaining as an asset to this business um and it's the customer rolodex and i think that's a that's a great one that costs xero out of pocket from day one it's just profit share uh you know if if a customer does come on over to you so i think that's a great one let's talk about um modular homes or tiny homes i think you have a couple of ideas on this so uh do you have one yeah we bought a modular home which i didn't even know did you know there's a difference between manufactured in a modular home there's also weird terminology no like i actually this is what i was going to ask you is like i thought a manufactured home is a modular home no there are two different things i guess so manufactured home basically means it's what we think about like stereotypically right it's a it's a trailer home basically all the difference is is that there's no foundation set so you can pick that bad boy up and you can move it right that's manufactured modular is that it's built in pieces which is modular what that means but it has a foundation so at the end of the day there's really no difference between a what is called a stick built home a house that probably you're living in that i live in right now and this modular home but the crazy part is is well one we've all seen these cool modular homes all over the place popping up but i was surprised i'm like they don't really make sense not at scale they're not that much cheaper and they're not that much faster when you just drop one on your property and i did a bunch of research asked a bunch of people they're kind of sexy but they're not that much cheaper but when they are cheaper is when you do them at scale and i was i was surprised that there weren't any developments that did this and so i started scouring the country found a few one in park city and bought there and the numbers were amazing and i bought it so i know they're real we bought our house for nine hundred thousand dollars in park city and um on an acre three thousand square feet the average price average or median is like uh 2.5 million dollars in park city so the cost that they were able to save was so amazing and they didn't pass it on to the user fully i think they weren't sure if we all were gonna actually buy into this but the houses are super sick and i think that's a model if i was a developer i'd be using those all day long and and i'd probably buy a modular housing company and then use it don't you think right yeah and so when you look at that home today can you tell basically this is anything but a normal home like is it aesthetically different uh once if you didn't know coming in what it was so i'll drop you the link right now i'm not gonna say where it is just in case anybody wants to come yell at me about something stupid i say online um but uh i'll drop you the link and you can see the difference but no it's super sweet looking so it's it's kind of the open concept big windows whatever the case may be and uh and you can't tell the difference the only difference really is that the turnaround time so we bought this in december of last year or january february i don't know and it'll be done by july and so it hadn't been built at all are you going to add to it like are you gonna have more modules to it so i'm gonna add a back office like module and then what we did is we got like five or six of our friends to buy in the same community and they're cool looking and so i think i'm going to do some event or something and utilize the four or five of them and then you could have it as a tax write-off because it'll essentially be like a little business okay this house is sick and so the company that's doing the development they're the company that's doing the development here they are not the actual uh manufacturer so there's three layers right there's the manufacturing level then there's going to be probably some delivery layer and then there's the developer who's doing a development marketing that and then there's like kind of the individual home buyer uh beyond that so have you looked at the manufacturers of this yeah so that's where this one's interesting the builder and the manufacturer actually in this deal together so they do own the modular company and at least a portion of it and then the builder is one that's built this in a couple other places they also have another location that i think is cool and also could work at scale which is modular tiny hotel rooms essentially and i believe that's in jackson hole wyoming and the economics are just so fascinating because you know our modular home will be built in less than six months it's about a third of the cost the square footage uh if you break out by square footage it's about a third of the cost and then the part that's interesting is in these locations where they're the weather's terrible you know and you can't break ground very often they um they build it all in a warehouse so it's fine they lay the foundations all in one period of time and then boom boom boom boom do all throw all the houses up as opposed to everybody else in park city has to wait like you know two years or something like that so we'll see but so far so good okay this is pretty sick i like this one um i'm gonna jump to more because i want to see uh what these other ones are all about so talk to me a little bit about let's do a couple of the controversial thoughts um i'm gonna rip through them pretty quickly and uh and so let's let's do the first one number one angel investing is largely dumb is that painful because we both are angel investors too and you have a rolling pin no i actually i actually say this i say this often and people are like you have a rolling fund and i'm like yeah uh i don't of all my investment types that i do this is i would say the worst one but i think it's still good and fun and i do it anyways but i have like two or three better ones than i do besides this yeah so i think you know one of my uh good friend's name is justin donald and we're both pretty obsessed with deal structuring one of the biggest things i have a problem with with angel investing is it's it's too fun it's like gambling right like you get excited about the founders and guess what founders are charismatic that's how they raise millions of dollars and so you end up getting sold and it's not their fault and then you know there's fraud and you know i wrote this whole piece about this one guy that we lost to two million dollars with because he just was super egotistical and like big images of himself on the wall like all this stuff later that i got added to my due diligence questionnaire of like how many images of yourself do you have in your office but um but the uh the thing with angel investing is you know this you need like 20 30 40 deals for every one to four that are going to go through and so i think that the other thing that we do a disservice is telling people to invest in angel early on once you've made a few million dollars and i mean that literally then i think go into angel investing or if you're on a path where you're making really good money and you've made at least half a million a million bucks then i think you can start angel investing but until then you know let other people lose money and learn from it you said it like you were like take a take a you know docusign image of every deal you want to do write down how you do it time stamp it so people can see and then decide later on how good you are at it without burning through a few tens of thousands of dollars yeah exactly uh okay so i have a bunch more thoughts there but i i largely agree with you and i would say like it's one of those here's my red flag is in order to talk in order to justify angel investing you have to give a blend of reasons it's like well it's really fun uh i like learning about the you know the future and the mark and these are all true things by the way so it is fun you do learn a [ __ ] ton so it's like an education um you can make great money if it you know pans out as you assemble your basket you know you should over a you know you should you know be netting you know a 20 plus irr it just takes a long time it's a liquid um and it's like not too much work um because you're largely investing in your network that you've already built for 10 years like that's kind of the thing and so there's like this blended reason and anytime you have a blended reason it really means that there's not one really great reason to do something um and so those are always like you know sub-optimal choices i find for myself at least whenever i have to come up with a blend and so and because i tell everybody this around me whenever they hear me justifying something with a blended reason they're like oh interesting so that's a pretty big blend and i'm like oh yeah we should just not do it never mind take it all back um because i'm giving you this huge list and instead of just saying we should do this because of x right like we should invest in this business because it's growing like like a weed and if it wins it's going to be this big that i can get behind and some angel investors do fall into that but the act of angel investing as like a job or a hobby is um is like it's more like when you describe playing basketball with your friends like oh it's great i get to hang out my friends i get a good run in i get exercise you know i i you know it's i get outdoors it's like you're giving this blend of reason uh for doing the the really fun thing you just really want to do and you're justifying it but the reality is you just want to do it your brain comes up with reasons afterwards i think that's exactly right yeah the only caveat i have to that is if you can go later stage deals which now you can do with a lot of the late stage uh angellist syndicates or if you can structure debt like if you can figure out a way where you start earning interest day one on a startup that actually has you know it's a little bit later stage and so it has some revenues or you could you know get into a debt deal that's on some of its you know factoring of the invoices it has like there's you know people always think of equity with startups but lots of startups prefer debt so do debt with like a equity warrant kicker on it and you can actually make money from day one and then have some equity upside and that i think is interesting but you know throw the y combinator term sheet out the window because it's not going to be on that right um and all that being said i'm still gonna angel invest uh because it's because it is fun um and it's you know it's a hobby that makes money so okay so let's do another one public market public market investing also kind of dumb talk to me there well this one i like to talk about a lot with big investors because if you look at the forbes 100 list there is not one person on there who made their money from just investing in the stock market and then this is where people are like cody warren buffett carl icahn and it's like i remember i was at goldman in 2009 when do you remember buffett did the deal to invest a bunch of money in goldman to stabilize it yeah yeah so um i was there then and it was not a public market deal warden didn't go out to the street and buy a bunch of stock he had a ton of warrants and options on top of it it was a total backroom deal and that's the only reason that he did it because he basically had this huge asymmetric wrist right where he had a bunch more upside than he had a downside and that's the same thing with icon who tries to affect the outcome so my point with people especially these days with like games and all the madness and stock investing is like if you don't have an unfair advantage if you can't like write down why specifically you're gonna win instead of somebody else you should be really careful speculating on stocks because the big boys don't really do it uh yeah i have a cousin who runs a hedge fund and uh when he told me kind of like all the different things that they have at their disposal i was like oh okay i'm i'm coming into a gunfight with like a fingernail uh that's kind of like how how uh lopsided it is and i so you know so so that being said again i think this is important to say skin in the game here do you own any public equities and uh so despite this do you just do like vanguard do you just say oh here's 10 companies i believe in i'm going to do that or what do you do yeah i don't hold any individual stocks for speculation purposes i invest in indices and i'm not saying this is right or i'm some guru i'm just saying i don't think i'm smart enough to beat the market and so i don't play games where i don't like the rules i'd rather write my own rules if at all possible so i go you know equity indices vanguard you know whatever the case may be i like vanguard the best um and then i go uh mutual funds on alternatives private equity reits where you can actually have an unfair advantage but i don't speculate on any individual stock now i don't i mean would i own apple amazon facebook whatever would i make a play on twitter if i thought that might be fun yeah maybe um but i think there's so many easier ways to make money with private market investing and buying businesses as opposed to having to deal with the irrationality of the crowds right i mean do fundamentals really matter in today's world or is it whoever has the best ir and doesn't have some crazy thing the ceo said or done right uh yeah exactly uh have you ever heard this term a keynesian beauty contest no what is that so uh named after i think the economist uh keynes yeah basically the the idea is that this is how the stock market works so a keynesian beauty contest is where you don't just uh send a normal beauty contest you sort of just would assess uh let's say the contestant that's that's on the stage but in this case the way the stock market works is it's not you assessing the true beauty of the thing it's you guessing what other people will value it at who are also guessing what other people will value it at and so it sort of is this like extr you get these like really warped things happen because everybody is not betting on the thing they're betting on what the other people will do about the thing and everybody knows that everybody's betting on what the other people will value the thing at and so you get these like really crazy um sort of out of whack things that that aren't you know value investing uh at its core yeah i totally totally agree let's do a couple more so uh buying real estate at auction so a way to buy real estate at a discount talk to me about this one i've never done this yeah this one's fascinating so for instance let's use texas well sam's in texas right but um i like texas because they do this thing where they actually sell real estate at auction on the courthouse steps of each municipality or city previous to it going on zillow or redfin or whatever the case may be like we've all seen those are these foreclosed is it foreclosed properties that you that you get there or what what type of properties are yes so foreclosed is really when it's listed on zillow and redfin and so that's sort of like this post auction step that's when most of us see foreclosed properties right so you're like oh no i know how to buy foreclosed i can go on redfin if it says foreclose i can buy it well prior to that you have auctions which actually are the bank auctions of bankrupt properties or foreclosed properties but you get it before the street does and then you can even front run that one step further which is there's a list of properties that are going to go into bankruptcy or foreclosure and the list in texas you can look it up right now it's called roddy's list r-o-d-d-y-s and on roddy's list you buy this list it's cheap like a couple hundred bucks and you can get the list of all the properties that are about to go foreclosed and then you can door knock you can go knock on the door because even though it sounds predatory it's actually not because if you go knock on the door and tell this person hey i'll give you 200 000 for the house that you are in foreclosure because you owe 50 that actually gets them out of bank foreclosure and gives them the extra money that the bank uh was going to write off for them so this is buying on the action steps and i did it with a friend of mine aaron mitchusdeggi who's a stud at it and uh and it's wild millions of dollars of transactions in cashier's checks happen same day on the courthouse steps why can't somebody bring that online so why is nobody built basically the tech platform that says great we go to all the court steps and then we you know sort of flash list these things and you can sit at your lap i can you know sean he's he likes this idea he loves getting an edge but he's kind of lazy and so he doesn't want to go do all this stuff um why doesn't somebody bring that online maybe like roddy's list i guess is an example of that bringing that part on mine um what about after that well i think you could there's a couple things that you need to do in real life like you have to validate that the house exists right and the the couple keys to the actual auction game are that there's some part that is just you gotta walk the walk so you could go and buy a house at foreclosure and look at it on google maps but google maps is an updated same day so that house actually might have burned down last week or a month ago and i know somebody that that's happened to or the house if you look at it on google maps you may not be able to tell that the inside of the house or you know the back end of the house is totally blown out so you've got to kind of go walk the properties a little bit there's one part of it right and then the other part is it's about debt and who owns the debt and like one thing i've realized about wealth over time is um debt is just about everything you should always look for even before you do a startup investment is there any debt on the company am i in a first lien does that you know do i have first access to money if this company gets it in some way and it's the same with a house so a lot of these times they'll have a lien on the property that's like this is weird this is actually an interesting business for you guys to look at like one of the biggest predators on uh low-income home uh owners is you know those faucets like the little water purification faucets that you have in like your house yeah so um oftentimes those are put in houses by people that come door to door and try to sell them to people and and they use it by doing a lien or applying debt to that person's mortgage and so you could literally have a lien before you for like 1500 that hasn't been paid so it's now worth like 25 000 because the interest is 10 or 12 percent and you don't even realize it so you do have to yeah so you do have to go actually figure out who owns the debt on the house and you do that again through a list like roddy's list that will tell you who owns the title to the house but none of these are big problems if somebody can list houses on zillow like zillow now buys sight unseen you could just have apis in from roddy's list from the local county uh location you could probably have updated google maps locations and all three of those things triangulate to go online i would imagine i like it um and uh roddy's list is only texas or that's only texas but there's tons of them so usually you have to go to the county registrar and they'll list how often they do how often do they do auctions so in texas it's every tuesday in california depends by city and county but one of the interesting things is like the biggest buyers of homes in california for instance uh in in this downturn in my opinion is going to be the government because they've essentially made it where if this is not your primary residence you cannot buy these foreclosed homes at auction which is a crazy change but in 2008 that's what happened all the pe firms went to all of these little municipalities and scooped up all these houses and got them at pennies on the dollar the only thing that is true about this is you need cash you got to pay cash so these are you know you're coming with a hundred thousand dollars in cashier's checks to buy this house and an auction and buy it at auction right yeah wild and i gotta just attend one of these to to see how it feels um okay we'll start we'll end on these last two um you wrote uh how to collect cool people i don't know what collect means in this case but is that a typo or did you really mean how to collect cool people i did mean that well actually i wish sam was here because he would laugh at this one but um so one of the things that i think is important for investors or vcs or anybody um i guess really who wants to be in the startup game is like how do you make a connection with a human like you right so you know we get to know each other on twitter i kind of retweet you a few times but before the social media game was there um how i actually met sam originally i liked one of his articles that he wrote in the hustle years ago and um and i just did some research on sam and was like you know i just think he's gonna he's gonna do some stuff i don't know what the hustle was small at the time uh but i think i want to know him and i want him in my rolodex in some way so i could bother him about things and um and so i found out what his favorite candy was which is butterfingers i don't know if it still is now and so i shipped him this ludicrous sized box of butterfingers right just like a [ __ ] ton of butter fingers to the point where like he didn't have a lot of choices except to like call me back and say like you know what thanks um and you know sam really well i mean he's not always thanks and what the [ __ ] yeah exactly exactly and so anyway so and then i did that with another good friend of both of ours noah kagan except it was something about tacos at the time because that's his little shtick and i sent him a shirt and so the whole point here i guess was kind of like people these days will say i'm sure they say it to you well but sean you have this huge network of course you could raise a fund this way or you know sam of course you could do this you have this giant rolodex of emails you know i didn't have any of that at the time i was in finance we couldn't even have social media and i think those are all excuses and instead you should just get kind of obsessed with the people that you think are interesting find ways to connect with them and you can even do it in an old school manner which might work more today than ever because dms and social media are inundated and uh what's your uh what's your next move so if the butterfingers and the tacos are the pickup line and that's great because i and and this happens to me and i i always feel like well you did break through the door like i i see you and i hear you and i kind of check you out and i'm like okay cool um but honestly like most of the time when that happens i don't like become buddies with them and i think that's what they want it's like i sent you that shirt like i sent you that thing because you said you said you like this and that so i sent it to you i'm like yes i did appreciate it but like i didn't necessarily go start like a bromance with you after that so uh what is what do you do let's say with your follow-through what do you do in those cases to like turn that little like you know funny just sort of like hey love what you do i'm a fan uh here's a bunch of butterfingers uh what did you do to turn that into more of like a peer relationship after that or what would you do yeah well i think a couple things one you got to be doing cool stuff to hang around cool people rule number one right right so like prerequisite exactly yeah so like you know i don't care if i was backing up a dumpster truck actually that would be i would probably be doing cool things if i did that for for sean but um but you know you have to actually be out there creating the thing to be around creators so i think that's rule number one and it's to have the lowest expectations humanly possible right like i don't want anything from sean i didn't want anything from noah i just wanted them in my circle and then to ping them sporadically with random stuff so i think i got noah like one of them his investments that he did i pinged him uh on it like he actually had a question about something else i he put it on twitter or something and i sort of responded and said oh i knew that person so it was trying to serve them a bunch of different times and then after doing that continuously which is very similar to what i do with founders when i want to invest in them they'll eventually be like cody just she kind of solves problems for me or she does interesting things and makes my life easier in some way and doing it without being too you don't want to be a creep you know i think i do think when i first uh engaged with noah and i can say this now because we're buds but i think he was like is she hitting on me like what's happening here you know does she like me and i was like no dude i'm married sorry um so you know but also just having no shame like i don't have an ego i'm not trying to prove anything to anybody and i think that's important what do you think what would work for you would that work for you uh yeah that that that's so so the thing you said that that works for me is first and foremost the ultimate networking hack is be interesting okay that sounds easy what uh that sounds like okay i can't do anything with that well no you actually can which what is interesting to other people is somebody who either knows stuff in an area that other people want to know that that thing so if you're an expert of a certain area cannabis defy just be knee-deep in it and you don't have to be like a power player just the knowledge is actually quite useful um the knowledge network or be doing interesting things so if i see you out there actually making [ __ ] happen in your field and it doesn't have to be a big you know so you don't have to be doing spacex like we got to be doing something so what doesn't work is the opposite uh you reach out you ask me for something you ask me for my most valuable thing time um without offering me any reason why i should give you that time and maybe i will anyways because i'm just in the mood but like you didn't help yourself by like making it easy for me uh and lastly you're basically saying hey i'm kind of doing nothing and i think if you talk to me then i'll start to like do something or i'll know what to do yeah and um and that's not fun like you know so what what do i like i like people who are doing interesting things and then they reach out or i reach out either way doesn't matter and in doing so they are like you said a non-needy person so they're happy to give they're happy to chat and they have low expectations one of the weirdest things is when people start with like hey big fan of what you do i know you get a ton of messages but i just wanted to put this on your radar uh cool great first message second message comes in like 19 hours later i guess you just don't even care um you know what's the point of of this anyways you know like um i really thought you were a good guy but now i know the truth it's like well what's going on like you sort of pulled a 180 and now you're really needy and desperate for some kind of response and now you expect things of me that i never ever offered to you um so i would say like you know just do the opposite of those bad things so be interesting uh don't expect anything in return uh just give and give little bits don't even give too much because giving too much it actually creates an obligation also so just keep it really simple share interesting things with the person share life updates if you're doing cool stuff and be useful if they're trying a project give them some feedback help them out reach share spread the word tell a friend whatever and uh let them know that you're kind of you know in their corner that's all that it takes really to like break through with most people and then from there um you know it's either gonna work or it's not and you know that that's fine uh not everybody's meant to be friends with everybody and that's okay yeah and don't ask to be uh mentored by anybody that's my biggest pet peeve i'm like i can barely mentor myself you don't want me mentoring you what are you talking about not to mention talking about an obligation it's like wait have you looked up the definition that means that i am supposed to lead you like on your path of purpose we don't even know each other man right so yeah i totally agree uh yeah and somebody said this and i thought it was totally spot on um they said you know the easiest way if you really do want a mentor first first things first acknowledge that seeking a mentor is a advanced form of procrastination um you think that you need a mentor before you do the thing and in reality your mentor and all other people who succeed don't use mentors as a prerequisite yeah they find people along the way that help but that's because they're just in furious motion and people turn and look who's splashing in this pool and sometimes they go and they lend a hand and you know when you need it but they didn't sit around say well if i get that mentor then i'm gonna do the things so that's the first thing it's a it's an advanced form of procrastination and secondly the way you actually do form a mentorship bond is you ask somebody for a specific uh situational piece of advice so not just what should i do but like hey i'm debating between these two options how would you think about this or here's how i'm thinking about it would you poke holes in that and then then you follow up which is where 95 of people fall off the cliff they get advice and they don't follow up with hey i listened to what you did or i did a variation of what you did and here's what happened uh people actually love hearing that update it's they're they're gathering data points of like what works what doesn't and it just feels good that like you close the loop you get some closure on that that conversation and then you just say and now here's the next thing like that's that's going on and you know some people will drop off because they don't want to deal with you and some people will give again and then you do that the third time you say hey here's what happened um and now this unexpected thing is going on uh and here's how i'm dealing with that and by the third one you guys will know either this works um we have good rapport we see the world in similar ways they complement each other they kind of like my spunk and i like their experience and like it meshes and we should do this um or you'll know by then that you know this is not the right fit and so how do that's how you organically ease into having a mentor rather than trying to put a label with a stranger and asking them to commit to something that they you know don't really necessarily want to do with you yeah you nailed it i also think this is like probably not very pc but i think it all becomes easier once you've achieved like a little bit of financial freedom like i think the less you're focused on making money every day and like uh you know being in that sort of employee lane and you can do interesting things with your money that opens up a ton of opportunities so i'm i'm pretty big on like it's hard to be ideologically free it's hard to be time free it's hard to really have any freedom if you don't have financial freedom and like that all means something different to us like you and i might think that that means x big dollar amount where some people might be like no it's just enough to cover you know the money that i need to pay today but that's like one thing i wish more people could think about it's like how do you how do you really get financial freedom so that you can do all the stuff you want to do um and then you know how do you get critical thinking freedom where you can actually learn to ask the right questions here's the bit of insight i've had uh the realization i've had recently because i worked for like a decade being like financial freedom that's what i want uh and even more so i was like okay i want to buy a house so that you know i want i want to have enough or i can give my mom a place because she'll have a better life that you know if we can do that and blah blah blah and um so i thought financial freedom that's the best kind of like that's my goal right now i think a lot of people are like that and um [Music] and now uh that i kind of achieved a lot of those goals i was like okay uh definitely my goals just got a bit kind of bigger and uh you know it's not like and it's true i definitely do like carry myself a little bit differently and choose projects and people differently because i'm not like i'm not in i don't need you for the money but um you know so i don't need to do this for the money i can do many things and money should probably come along with all of them and i don't i don't need near-term money necessarily um so so there definitely has been some benefits but here's the realization i used to think about financial freedom like if i get x dollars then for me and my lifestyle that's i'm financially free and then um for another person they might have a different dollar amount which i think is kind of what you're saying and i thought that you know as recently as like a month ago and then i met um a bunch of people who have a way smaller dollar amount but what they have actually also is way fewer demands and desires about what they want out of their life um uh you know in a good way like they're happy as is so they don't feel like well i need x then i'm gonna be like happier yeah i'm super happy right now and like great if i have more money like i'll have other things but i'm not going to have more happiness and so um and so what i realized was that financial freedom is actually just it's an internal question it is not about a dollar amount financial freedom is when you stop deciding what to do based on money that's when you have achieved financial freedom and for some people it takes getting a large amount of money so that they can do that stop for other people it's wanting less [ __ ] and then they can stop because they have less demands for money their their total numbers lower and for other people it's uh more like you know sort of buddhist or monk like where they just sort of realize that it's actually uh an internal attachment that they have to let go of and then they are now free uh the freedom is is uh freedom from your own desire to have more money and therefore you choose things based on money uh rather than the kind of mathematical definition which is well you like like there is also like a sort of technical definition which is you have enough money where even if you earn zero income your investments will pay your lifestyle uh and you won't be sort of dip you know you're not dipping into savings your savings are increasing at a rate faster than your life burn and there is that technical definition but i realize i know many people who pass that technical definition and still aren't financially free and it's because internally they have not actually freed themselves from what they need uh uh from this idea of like well i gotta do like putting money first as the choice uh as a choice of what to do uh whether it's people who penny pinch or people who choose projects based on a financial return as the like kind of core criteria yeah anyways that's the sort of i like that uh no i think it makes a lot of sense i think you know above a certain level like i get a little obsessed just with everything that's going on economically in the world with people who again like aren't maybe where you and i are like i almost think financial freedom might have something to do with your skill stack like even if you lost all of your money today or if i lost all of my money today as long as i have put as much relationship deposit as i think i have of other humans that are doing interesting things in the world you and i are never going to be homeless like pending catastrophic issue right because you can go to some of your friends and be like hey i'm actually pretty good at copywriting don't you see look at my twitter account hey i'm actually pretty good at building these businesses i've sold a couple of them so once you like get that skill stack you're like i'm fairly confident worst case scenario i can go call up somebody and work for them um so i think there's some mixture of the dollar amount in your bank what you need to pay not having a ton of debt and then are you competent enough as a human where somebody will always need your services and and you know and i think that paired with like what can you reason and think for yourself is a pretty powerful combo yeah don't uh totally agree i think that's great so give us uh we should wrap up we give us where where can people subscribe to the newsletter because it's actually really damn good um and i don't say that like actually i'll i'll say i would probably say that anyways if somebody came on his guess i'm like oh you have a great newsletter but i'll just kind of shout out that i actually believe it here i'm not just being polite uh but you actually do a really great job and you're like us you don't shy away from the topic of money um you actually lean into it you say hey you know like a lot of people are interested in making money and a lot of people don't know what's under the hood of these different business models or businesses and so like let's lift the hood together and let's look at this how this engine works and how it what's good about it what's bad about it and how you might wait make it work we do that as a podcast you do that on your newsletter and we are very like simpatico as far as that that goes and so where can people find you and where can people find the newsletter so they go subscribe thanks for the shout out yeah contrarianthinking.com is the newsletter uh and then it's cody sanchez cody underscore sanchez on twitter i think those are probably the two places i'm most rocking and rolling um and twitter man i've really found that fascinating in the last six months i think we've finally figured out how it works so apparently i'm a little bit more a boomer than a millennial in some ways yeah there you go uh cool and we'll link it in the description so if you didn't remember those just scroll down and click the links in the description to uh to find that of the podcast okay cody this has been amazing thank you so much i would like to have you back on at some point maybe we'll break down a couple of the businesses that you've either acquired or been looking at recently and i think that'll be a lot of fun but thank you for coming i'm in thanks for all the questions it's always fun brainstorming with you i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on a road less travel never looking back [Music] uh

says subscribe click that button and something really amazing is going to happen and i want you to tweet at me the sampar with a picture of that and uh we're gonna you're gonna see this brand new feature that apple just for launch it's it's a really cool hack that we just discovered so click that button and tell us what's happened this is what they were talking about in the keynote yesterday right yeah it's like a big deal only a few people got access to it i knew a guy and i got access to it so go ahead and click that subscribe button and if you're in spotify uh i talked to daniel l he actually they're releasing something too click the button that says daniel the cousin of daniel eck the actual founder of spotify right it's their cousin it's a norwegian thing or uh you know uh swedish thing whatever he is it's a scandinavian thing um anyway today we've got a great episode sean who do we have we had elaine zelby on she's a vc at signal fire and um more importantly she is an ideal woman so she has a sub stack that's three new ideas every week uh very much like what we do she also does this thing called i don't know what it's called but it's a podcast about boring businesses like unsexy it's called unsexy unsexy it's about like you know oh you run a chemical plant tell me about that you know so things like that so very much uh in line with what we do we had a bunch of uh we brainstormed a bunch of ideas so we talked about ideas the adulting vault we'll tell you what that is um the smoo sleep uh sleep bed for adults uh therapunch was one of the ideas a subscription shoe company idea and um and there we go that's one with the the startup sas bundle that was the best startup sas bundle and also she kind of gave us a peek under the hood signal fire has this thing that's like a this data machine that spits out like you know great investments using all the 27 different data signals and we were kind of asked her like hey is that [ __ ] is that just marketing seems like it's just marketing is that [ __ ] and uh she gave a pretty good response so we kind of talked about that as well all right we're gonna get to the episode but first remember go to the uh the podcast store click that button that says subscribe and then you have to send me a picture on twitter the sampar and you're gonna see this new feature that apple released i promise it's gonna be worth it so make sure everyone does it right now thank you so elaine hey what's going on uh i'm sam parr we haven't met i think you were on the podcast before when i was sick um so sam last time she was on she had one idea that well two ideas one that went kind of like semi-viral that was the milk bombs idea of like a functional milk bomb uh i don't know if you even know what that means like yeah you get the you get that the picture basically you dunk a little like a bath bomb you dunk it into your milk and it sort of has a little fizzy color whatever experience and you're adding some uh some adaptogen adaptogen people like that one a lot but now that we have like these viral video people oh it would be on a whole nother level now yeah should we ask her to yeah is that like that's like a pretty virally thing but sorry go ahead we'll do that and the other one i really liked was um fantasy football for stocks so basically creating a little game like let's say we could create a game me you andrew whoever and um we each get our a budget we we allocate it into a portfolio that you you get to change it every month or so and then we see whose portfolio would have performed the best like fantasy football where you get points based on the you know the ups and downs of the stock so a very social you're not actually investing it doesn't have to be real money a very social way to be gambling or betting on on stocks what do you think of that one sam i used to do that as a kid didn't we do that as a kid in like class there was a thing back in like seventh grade i think everybody did this one fantasy portfolio for like a month at school and uh but it hasn't it was it was pretty rudimentary then and it never made its way out so i think somebody who worked at yahoo fantasy football they should just basically fork everything they learned about how to make yahoo fantasy football viral and be like cool i'm gonna do that except instead of you know the patriots it's gonna be you know amazon and tesla and whatnot did you folks um have you guys used uh is it called the they were one of our sponsors uh was it weeble what's the israel israeli coinbase competitor israeli coinbase israeli yeah they're yeah one of those words is wrong uh coinbase it's an exchange crypto yeah yeah well it's but they um i think it's weeble um but they have this feature so basically it's like a stock investing platform i know about we bull like bull yes yeah yeah yeah is that the one but anyway they have this feature where they have this thing where you can sign up and you can choose to share your portfolio with anyone and people can copy you and i thought that was kind of amazing uh it's kind of like turns and you like invest in their fund and i don't even think they make any money off of it but it's just like there's a bunch of these that came out in the last i don't know two years elaine you've probably seen all of them public came out as like one of the robin hood competitors where it's like a social network a social feed where you can see what people are investing in then there's the more extreme versions like what you're talking about like uh doji i think is one of them and in doji i create kind of like my little basket of stocks and i call you know the sean index and you could just straight up buy the sean index and you can invest in all my stocks and i get kind of like it's like my index becomes more popular because you've invested in it and you trust me and it like shows that you follow it or you invested in it well in 2017 so eric voorhees who was the guy that created shapeshift he actually created satoshi dice he was super super early in the crypto space he launched something that never got out of private beta called prism and you could create a basket of tokens this is when all the altcoins started popping up on ethereum and you could show so it could be you know sean's basket of tokens and sams and you could watch and i could follow you and i could just invest in your basket of tokens but it was a competition too and i thought it was such a great idea i'm not sure why it never got off the ground but it was cool i digged it can i ask you elaine what is signalfire i'm on your website um like your landing page is i want whatever you're selling but i'm still a little confused as to what it is so we do that a little bit on purpose we are a venture capital firm but we're actually structured and operate a lot more like a technology company so if you look at our team we're about a third engineers and data scientists building products we're about a third people on our platform these are the in-house business people doing pr recruiting growth and then we have investment and we you know we essentially monetize via the investment vehicle and we're currently investing on our fun three which is 500 million dollars but you know we're not we don't have capital in the name we don't have ventures in the name we definitely try to be a little bit more startupy than the traditional vc so but are you using like on your web page on the landing page it's like you guys use some type of data to spot trends is that is that so we buy scrape or you know aggregate every data signal you could possibly imagine and our engineers have proprietary algorithms that use that data to do one of two things one we have different systems that are alerting systems for us on the investment side so they pull in all these signals and they try to show us at seed at series a and at series b who are the cool companies what should we be looking at and also trends around markets and things like that fundraising trends and then we have a bunch of products for the portfolio around talent migration talent movement who's good who's in market from a hiring perspective competitive intel co-spend analysis market intel all that kind of stuff do you so like when a lot of people like when sean and i probably have both started our things um which like granted by the way by the way first unicorn officially today my one of my angel investments officially raised at over a billion dollars although i gotta say it's not super exciting because it's a company i was trying to invest in from the seed but at this point i wasn't like a and i was running my company i wasn't like i was i only wanted to invest i thought it was a great idea and i like the founder but i like forgot to follow up and then like oh i followed up he's like oh dude we closed that like two months ago sorry i'll get you in the a and then when the a came around it was like oh dude it's super competitive sorry i'm not gonna be able to get you in so finally he messaged me he was like hey man i'm gonna make sure i get you in this time i feel like i i [ __ ] you over you know once you missed it the first time we're definitely gonna get you in here in the i don't know the b yeah the b round at a 200 million valuation i was like bro 200 million i knew you when you were a baby here this was this is way too high all right [ __ ] it i'm in and so uh that company is now worth over company um i don't know if i could well we'll say i might i might bleep it out come on you have to tell we may have to bleep it out because he may not have announced it yet but it's a company called deal and they do my husband and i were talking about that one this morning yeah okay what were you guys talking about my first unicorn because i appreciate that yes the joke is this is essentially a company i wanted to build three years ago and i started seeing every startup that had 10 employees was starting to hire internationally and they had to treat them as contractors and there was no way to manage it and if i looked under the hood most companies were using shield geo as the peo and everyone hated it super old school so i was like okay somebody needs to go and build a better shield geo under the hood do kind of the plaid model of building the nitty-gritty going into each country that people in the us hire remotely with and build out the you know infrastructure go and find every startup and say hey we're going to handle all the hiring the payroll compliance everything for your remote people i love it i think it's such a good idea wait so what sorry how do you spell it sean d e e i think the url is let'sdeal.com unless they change i think they got deal.com also now oh cool so i actually use it uh that's how i pay kind of like any contractors that i work with even if they're in the us i'm like oh this is way easier because i just type in their name i say what the contract is every month i'm going to pay them this at the first of the month it's like would you like an mda with that i'm like yeah why not let's add on an nda they're like great would you like to add a milestone based payment i'm like you know what that's a good idea i do like milestone-based payments that's that aligns our incentives it's like boom here's a contract we've sent it to them when they'll sign it it'll be kept in your records automatically for you we took care of all the the compliance and tax issues that you're gonna have to deal with based on where they live and um we'll connect to your bank and then it'll auto pay every month for for you and send you an invoice when you're done and i was like oh wow that's great you just eliminated the need for me to have like a person who does that whole thing by the way it's on their page that they've just raised money at a billion dollar uh valuation so their biggest competitors so there's two big ones papaya global and remote.com and deal started out a little bit differently the other two said hey we're going to really focus on full-time employment internationally they focused on contractors and they've had to shift from my understanding a little bit because in reality you don't just have contractors for the most part and you want one-stop shop you want to go and have different solutions for the different types of employees right so i think they now have everything exactly that's everything they also let you like pay in crypto and pay in every currency and like you know they're do they're doing all those kind of gnarly problems which is great uh i almost invested in remote.com also i really like that guy uh his his name is job uh the guy who's like this founder i think it's pronounced something like slightly different but it's j-o-b and i just like i love that whenever it's like usain bolt is the fastest man in the in the world i'm like this guy named job is is creating the platform for hiring remote workers like okay i'm in i'm interested and he was like interested in this company deal uh as soon as i heard the idea i was like oh yeah that's a pain point like that's a real pain point and i don't know how people solve it but if i look i went to their website i saw it was like it's real similar i'm not that sophisticated right it's like yes this is a real problem then i go to your website and i'm like oh you're one of the easy to use products which is like just kind of the standard best practices of design and like clear like good colors good font clear copy two clicks and you're done and i was like oh yeah this is gonna win and so then i started um hitting up the founder and i met with them and i was like oh this is amazing let's let's do something and then like unfortunately you know this would have been a much much bigger return had i just been like a little bit more proactive about following up before but you know i feel like i've learned that lesson 30 times you invested ten thousand dollars in them let's say um would that mean that it's worth like what five times more well at the current valuation yeah um on paper on paper yeah um uh but if i had done it at the seed it would have been you know maybe i think the seed was probably like 10 15 million um coming out of yc and so you know that's that's taking 10 million turning it into a billion in terms of the multiple uh plus dilution blah blah blah not that interesting more importantly i can now say i invested in a unicorn so that's just a stamp that i needed to collect here also i appreciate your honesty that you invested at the b because so many people will come in at later rounds and be like i'm in all these unicorns and they invested in the previous round what i wanted to ask though was elaine so when i started my company i just was like this seemed like it could work and it's fun and i'm good at it i bet sean kind of did the same i bet where's like uh yeah it might work signal fire seems far more um analytical my question is in reality do you actually think that that matters like if i'm trying to start something do you actually think that the likelihood that i'm going to succeed by but if i just said elaine um give me three things to start versus i'm just gonna go do whatever is do you think that you would let me give you an example here of like honesty so when i started my rolling fund the marketing was i have this big podcast that's going to help me get deal flow and podcast well okay if you have a podcast that does 5 million downloads a year in the business nation startup niche it's like okay that's a unique asset i see how you're different than the other funds in reality most of my deals don't come from podcast listeners sending me stuff or reaching out to me most of the deals are from the same five friends who email me when they see something cool and like that would have been much less sexy to talk about like oh i have five great friends who will email me cool stuff and i email them cool stuff but in reality that's how the best deals happen and or just like i'm bored on twitter a lot when i see something cool i reach out again doesn't sound that great for my fund marketing but is closer to reality so the question is basically how often are your deals because you're like computer programs like dude this company under value growing fast nobody's heard of it versus another fund share something with you or you guys are interested in space and you see something cool on product owner or whatever and you reach out and then that's how it happens so can you give us the truth well so in general venture capital i have the most commoditized asset you can imagine that i'm selling i'm selling money and so in terms of differentiation you talking about having this podcast having a different model and differentiation does go a long way but if i break up venture capital into five stages it's sourcing so how do i find people diligencing picking winning and then supporting and so we try to leverage data in probably four of the five different categories on the sourcing side we've definitely done deals that were completely from our alerting system in addition we just do a ton more outbound than the average firm because we'll go in these meetings and we'll triage based off of oh this looks interesting and oh elaine is connected to the founder or elaine knows about this industry you go follow up right so we do a lot more of that outbound than traditional is it the majority of our deals no on the diligencing side really trying to understand how good are these people so giving people you know talent scores understanding hiring patterns mobile app downloads alexa score trends a lot of the stuff you guys look at in you know the similar web or a-refs or that kind of stuff we're just doing on a different level but i would say where we have the most value does that level actually matter so you you basically said that you you must listen because we i talk about aha reps all the time we talk about similar webs all the time that's like anyone could do that for either free or for 100 a month and it's like i could just skim it and i kind of have an idea you kind of implied that you do that times 10 or whatever it is is that way actually better than our way i think in our industry it does actually move the needle for us so give us an example like you know if i'm watching billions and i'm like oh [ __ ] bobby actually you know he gets satellite data and he can see you know how many trucks are leaving the factory every day and that's how you know blah blah blah i've seen some things in vc where it's like you know everybody's kind of got app annie or whatever like something to look at app growth but you know i don't know second measure where you get credit card spending data aggregated that can be more interesting or like you know if you're plugged in with pipe or somebody you could see recurring revenue businesses that are growing in some way before maybe others do so i'm curious what's a cool data source that give me an example like oh we have this one data source and that helped us spot this cool company can you tell a story like that so it's not the one data source piece it's the fact that we buy or have access to all of them and then we combine them in unique ways so it's really about the joining of the data and what that surface is for us and that could be again on the you know we we look at things like business filings and then we combine that with data on okay well what is their website what are their app i can download that you know somebody is a founder based in san francisco they just incorporated their company as a delaware c corp i can then know when they filed for incorporation i know who the person is i can put them through our talent ranking score or our founder ranking score i can then see who are they working with how good are those people what is the business category how interesting is that for us how investable is the timing so we have a kind of timing alerting system too those things combined will then give it a score and saying okay this one you should look at versus when you shouldn't based off of the aggregate score and that's the piece that i think actually helps not the single data set or the single piece of info you guys have a score can you give me my founder score what am i i could but i don't think i'm allowed to oh come on what's going on here this is the best marketing ever for signifiers i know we do we actually do score uh we give people ranks it's uh you know one is like the number one person we think in our list right now and then it kind of goes down so it's like a chess ranking it's like you know there's like like an elo score basically or something where everybody is actually ranked one to one million or whatever pretty much yeah exactly and it changes what's going on no because it's for us like we only invest see in series a and series b so i don't care about people in those other categories i want to know who are the best people starting companies right now that are actively looking for funding gotcha that's the timeliness is actually really important but the thing that's also really cool about what we can do so i'll give you a really concrete example we have a company that is in the shopify ecommerce infrastructure ecosystem and they were looking to say hey we want to go and target i'm going to make these numbers up but we want to target every merchant who has between 10 and 100 million dollars in revenue in these four categories and here are three buyer titles oh and like here here's where they need to be located we can go and pull all that data we match that up to the people at the company so we say here their email addresses here are the people you should go after after and we create this kind of custom lead list for them and so being able to do that really really really that's on the support the company said so and you guys sell access to this platform right like this is a product no yeah no that's one i was gonna ask you because why i mean i bet you can make uh like 50 to 100 million dollars a year in um bernie told me that you guys are spinning this out or considering spinning this out as a product we do not sell it and we don't spin it out that's part of our whole selling point is that this is within the family so if you come and take our money and become part of the signal fire family you get access to all this stuff so we don't actually give it out outside of it interesting okay who uh who came up with this so our founding partner chris farmer has a long history in the vc world and he kind of got frustrated saying why are we investing in these bleeding edge tech companies and we're literally doing deals by talking to our friends kind of what shawn was alluding to and so he's like look we have access to all this data why are we not leveraging it and so he had kind of spun this out in his last firm and then created an entire fun cycle around it and a firm around it yeah i'm going to say i still think it's 50 marketing and 50 useful but that's higher than it was in my head an hour ago where i would have said it's 90 percent just marketing and 10 useful so you've done a good job you've moved he's right elaine 40 please say that again is he right in terms of what it is uh i would say more useful than not for sure especially i think the two areas i would say it's on the barbells it's definitely useful on the flagging sourcing companies that we would never have seen and it's very very useful on the supporting side and honestly we're as i mentioned before you know we kind of like say we're a startup we do okrs we measure nps score we kind of treat ourselves like a tech startup in terms of how we operate and so for us we care so much about our nps we care so much about are we moving the needle for founders so if we can be you know if that's the only place that it's really valuable that's that's enough you know that's that's really enough right now did you ever hear about chamoth's uh eight ball yeah yeah this sort of reminds me of that yeah go get this is this is going to be a clip i tell go for it uh yeah so so chamath who was you know founder of social capital or is the founder social capital at one point in time was like look we uh he came from facebook super data driven growth team he was like leading the growth team helped grow it from whatever 100 million users to a billion users and he was like well why don't we have that same level of analytical rigor when it comes to our companies and sort of as that thought evolved it came down to something really simple he goes let's make capital as a service uh instead of you know software service capital as a service so here's how it goes it's self-serve you come and you plug in your analytics our little algorithm will run a formula and it'll basically tell you two things it'll say here's how you rank relative to other sas companies that are your size your age in your kind of like price point or your demographic and then so you'll know if you're above the benchmark if your retention is way better or way worse than other companies and then secondly they were like this is our moneyball formula to basically figure out if we should invest in you or not and um and so that they hyped it and as a founder it was a little bit scary right you're going to go am i going to give to moth like all my data basically pipe right into our database and just say hey here you go and it feeds their system right because whether they invest in us or not they've just downloaded hey at this point in time here's how this company was doing and then they take your historical data as well so it's like they sucked in all this data so that if they looked at the hustle they'll know whether they should invest in the hustle but also morning brew and the skim and any other company like the hustle they'll be able to compare and contrast and as a founder it's useful because you want to compare and contrast but you've just uh you know you've opened up your blouse to tichimoth and i think that that was for me a little bit scary but i think um some people really liked it and ultimately i think it was more marketing than than substance i don't know elaine what's the word on the street but like i don't see them using it anymore i know that the group of people that spawn off of chamoth like uh arjun and those guys from tribes i think they still do that or that's a big piece of it they don't maybe brand it that way but um i don't know elaine was was that like was that legit was it as secret saucy as they tried to make it sound or was it a little overhyped i was never on the inside so i have no idea i know that it was very polarizing in terms of what you were saying some founders loved it some founders hated it in my opinion it only works at certain stages and in certain categories this does not work at all at the seed stage you're betting on people for the most part and you're betting on the growth of a category there's no data there's nothing that's going to give me by the way most startups don't have their data structured enough or in a way that you can actually like run these types of to apples analysis until you're ready clear bank clearbank makes sense to me because you're literally saying hook into my facebook and google data there's nothing that i could be yeah and there's nothing i can be fudging around that i'm gonna go analyze it and say you put in 10 to facebook you get out 15. i'm going to give you a short term high interest loan it works for everybody we win people are now doing this for amazon sellers and to your point shopify so on amazon it's much more around working capital so people are constantly in these manufacturing cycles where cash flow negative so they're like okay well i can hook into your amazon seller portal i can see exactly what your you know inflow and outflow of money is i can hook into your bank account i should be able to do dynamic loans so i'm never at peak you know peak exposure from a loan perspective for very long i'm kind of like constantly pulling it in and pulling it out that makes a ton of sense to me yesterday i invested in a c stage company and i pretty much only did it because sean did it um i basically i was like i think this is silly are you in he goes i'm in i i if you don't want to go in ask him if i could have your your i was like i love it and he's like yeah i don't know i think i hate it i was like what's there to hate it's amazing and then he's like yeah it's so good that i kind of hate just popular things it seems so good and i was like that's the stupidest thing i've ever heard i said if you don't want it give me your share and because i was asking the founder for more it was hypey it was hypey it's got all the cool kids in it and i'm like oh all the cool kids are doing it i don't want to do it but sean was like well i'm doing it and i talked to the guy and the guy seemed wonderful and i really don't even know can we talk about the company now or do we need to talk about it next episode so that there's a little distance between this combo and that uh yeah yeah i guess okay it's called synthesis do you know this one no what do they do ah the algorithm didn't spot it but hey the uh five friends did did uh did spot this all right so this is a cool company so the uh the story of this is have you heard of ad astra which is like elon musk's personal school that was inside spacex so for those who don't know elon musk you know he's ceo of spacex the ceo of tesla two kind of like multi multi-billion dollar companies and um his kids were going to school he basically needed to have his kids be in school and he kind of was like you know the traditional school system is not so great why don't we build a school inside spacex that's um done the way we think and his his big kind of like theory was in schools they teach you um like here's this tool right like let's say calculus or algebra right like here's algebra go learn algebra but they don't tell you kind of like why you need to know algebra right like maybe they should be teaching you how to you know run a lemonade stand and in order to calculate how many lemons you're going to need per day boom we'll teach you algebra that's a tool to help you do this thing you wanted to do so his his big thing was why don't we teach kids how engines work rather than how what a wrench is uh as like a basic analogy and so he creates this the school um or he wants to have the school and he creates it and there's a guy i think josh is his name he runs the school at spacex it's great it's kind of like well known and the kind of the fundamental premise was kids were learning by by really but like playing games and so uh have you guys seen the movie ender's game yes so in ender's game you basically you're in small teams of kind of kids and then you go into one like simulation area where you're gonna you know your teammate fights against team b and c and um the game always has like some kind of like arbitrary set of rules but it teaches you like strategy and teamwork and communication and like all the different things you need to do to win the game and so um kids love it because they play it's it's competitive it's like doing not just sitting there listening to a lecture and so anyways those are the same principles they took into this so let's say they they'll create a game that's like i don't know um it's about art right so instead of telling you okay here we're going to talk about art so sit down and read these three chapters about you know the renaissance period of italy and memorize it no instead they'll create like a map it's like okay where do you want to explore and then you pick you're like japan you go to japan and you find this artifact and then you have to bid on it and the other teams are bidding on it too are you trying to decide should we bid on this well let's go look at it let's go look at italy let's see what they have there and the team goes and all these kids are playing this together on zoom anyway so it's it's this really cool totally different alternative like form of education and so what ended up happening was the guy who created this at spacex for elon and his kids um the game system was called synthesis and what he did was they spun it out with elon's blessing elon's like hey go for it like yeah this more kids should have access to this and he paired up with this guy who was like the number one engineer at class dojo so he had been working at an edtech company signalfire is an investor this is our portfolio company and so they got together and they created this this company synthesis and they um okay i guess can't share too much of their numbers but they have this amazing traction so far you know business is only six to eight months old they spent zero dollars on paid marketing all the attention has come because of free press and people who are reading about elon school and just sort of click the links and find them and it's gotten the greatest headline ever which is like elon musk spinning off school right and the defender was very honest he was like you know honestly like we had a big question like does this only work if it's rocket scientist kids right because like maybe they are willing to like really engage in this material and figure it out and play these things like but is this accessible if your dad is not a you know a rocket scientist at spacex uh or your mom is not like a you know data scientist or uh wherever and so um but they found that you know it does and so they have like super high retention amazing uh revenue already in six months uh you know doing multiple millions of dollars a year in revenue with zero dollars paid marketing and what seems like the perfect team it's the guy who created the school at elon's thing and this guy from class dojo and so i was like what's not to love great impact super cool product i want to send my own kids there great traction in a very short amount of time and like tons of room to grow because they haven't even started marketing yet and so i was like i love it and sam was like yeah like it seems really great but i'm skeptical of real things that everything every everything's expensive it was expensive well can i pitch you a spin on this that i wrote about recently and you can you can give this to the guys because it might be interesting for them so i wrote about a concept of doing this but on top of roblox and the reason being roblox already has the eyeballs and the attention of kids 75 of kids between 9 and 15 i think are on roblox and today you know anybody can go and build these games but why can't you go and build games i was focusing more on life skills so things like financial literacy which you never learn mental health which you never learn all the things that you'd want either a younger kid or a teenager to learn gamify it but build it where they're already there and also enable the kids to become the builders so partner with some people like these two people doing synthesis bring in some kids to make it actually appropriate and age appropriate and then let them have some of the upside and let them spin off the games and bring in their millions of followers but i think there's something to be done on top of roblox yeah i love that i think um that works for two reasons one is you can if you okay teaching kids through games not a new idea like when i was a kid i was playing math blaster and what you know whatever else these little games on whatever you know we had a computer room at my house and i used to go there and get to play an hour a day and um so you know teaching kids through games obviously been around for a while but now the games are already built with tons of love uh kids already know the controls like in fortnite or roblox they already know how to play they're already super familiar with it they already love the game and so and they also have now created roblox and fortnite have these like kind of open field open world systems where you can go build whatever the hell you want and just share the link and so it makes total sense to me to borrow the millions of dollars they poured into their game engine and the marketing um and the distribution where they already have kids with accounts to just say now all we have to build is the learning experience and um and so i think that is a a great idea can i they might be able to port it over you know they can port some of these games to roblox can i ask you about something you wrote about and see so you have elaine has a sub sack uh uh zell is it what's zelby.subsec.com three things that's just my last name um it's it's cool uh it's a lot like this podcast you basically put out three kind of business ideas a week right is that the idea exactly i write about three requests for startups or opportunities i see to build big businesses and like how i would do it how i would monetize it and why now great so obviously everyone should go sign up for that because it's it's right at this r alley um i think i've seen you because you've linked to us a couple once or twice and i've like tracked the traffic back um all right so you have this thing called startup sas bundle and i wanted to bring this up because i think that most everyone listening is in the world where they can actually go out and start this i think that i've actually investigated this a ton so i i have or i don't own it anymore but we used to own this thing called the hustle so we had like two million subscribers of many of which are like these businessy folks and i'm like oh we should make this and sell it there's actually a lot of reasons i think why this can't work at a huge scale but i think there's a bunch of reasons why it could work at like a i think you could build a five to ten million dollar a year company in like three to four years pretty straightforward can can you talk about your uh ideas here and you can actually tell me if you think i'm wrong or right yeah and i'll tell you why i think it's way bigger than that right so the idea here is if you look at the average series a company they're using i think the status 34 different sas applications and what happened was we used to have these monoliths which are sap and oracle and i used to joke like bring back sap and i don't really mean that but what i mean is i am so sick of now having to deal with 34 vendors 34 uis 34 logins and passwords you know 34 different bills and renewal cycles and all that kind of stuff it just makes no sense and if you think about what core business software runs a startup it's very consistent you have things like you need g suite or office 365 you need some kind of communication tool you need something for payroll for hr for accounting for recruiting for like crm marketing project management issue tracking and help desk like those to me that is the core of business software and of course they're best in breed for all these things at the smb level the mid market level the enterprise level but in reality if you're a startup that is seed series a probably even getting into series b you need like not the 80 20 rule but like 60 of the functionality and that's the easier stuff to build the additional bells and whistles are the harder pieces and those aren't even utilized by these early companies so the idea is look okay if you wanted to build a bundle and get people to migrate over if they've already bought eight different pieces of software that's nearly impossible but if you catch people when they have nothing and you're gonna say hey we have this out of the box bundle you can start with three modules but as you go and you want a crm because you didn't have a sales team before just add on the crm module it already hooks in it's super seamless it has the same user experience no new login no new vendor relationship and you kind of continue to add to the bundle as your needs evolve and break this down though is you said something important that we have to go back to you said something you said it won't work if you already are using something yes can you explain why because that's actually a really big deal yes ripping and replacing software is so painful and it's incredibly hard to get people to do it you've already trained your team on it it has all of your information and data sitting in that system it's just really hard to rip something out when it's there which is why things like salesforce are gazillion dollar companies even though people complain about it all the time it's that is your system of record for that thing so i think that the vendor won't give you what let's call this elaine company elaine elaine bundle company they're not going to give a lane bundle company a referral fee i think for correct and the whole way this makes money i mean i guess there's two way a subscription or a referral fee their sales force is going to say uh no these customers already use us we're not going to like give you any more discount or we're not going to give you a let me clarify so so you're not saying it's not class pass it's not saying pay me x and then you get discounts across all your 34 apps what you're saying is make a beginner version of the core eight things as a as an actual bundled thing not the single player apps our single function apps and do the 80 20 and just do the core functionality don't get the the long tail of like edge case features that you need and offer it to somebody out of the box as like hey here's the simple thing so you don't need to sign up for 12 different services yes and when you look at the volume of companies at the early stage versus the later stage which need enterprise functionality the volume is like 1000x at the early stages so in terms of your ability to capture those people and capture them early where they are going to be sticky and they're going to grow with you to a point will people outgrow this maybe but the number of people that ever get to that scale are so few and far between that i just don't think it matters right and i think people have to acquire those customers early on we work with um a lot of people who advertise with the hustle and all their whole like we're uh one of them is called just works you know what just listen yeah this works is basically a i'm gonna kind of dumb it down really dumb but it's basically a payroll software but because of the way that they operate you have to sign up with them pretty much from the beginning like right when you start a company and i have a feeling that they're struggling because they can't get it's really hard to get a lot of those people to sign up for you so challenging in the same way in the same way it's hard for signal fire in order to find companies who are just starting it's really really hard for these folks well so here's my hack and i learned this so back in the days when i was first getting into startups i got really into growth hacking back in like 2013 when it was a really hot topic and i started my own side hustle consulting gig working with seed and series a founders on growth and i learned really quickly that if i partnered with the vcs they would just send me unlimited number of customers i never did any business development because they're constantly investing in net new seed and series 8 companies and they're trying to be helpful and their companies 100 of companies are needing help with growth 100 and so they're like okay who should we send them to send them to elaine so the hack here is you start with all the vcs so they're getting i get asked a dozen times a week what software should i buy for this what tool should i use for that so that's my hack to get started then you start to get some viral word of mouth going among founders because founders have their groups online they have their communities they talk they're saying oh dude you have to get this like that's the best software you can use for all your stuff so that's how i would go to market even then like where you were growth hacker growth comes right after growth comes after you have a team you have a product you have something right you start to talk about growth whereas yeah even when you talk to a vc you've already done something you usually are not like there is precede where it's like just you know two people not an idea but um it is still hard to catch you before you've even started with slack and g suite and uh you know three of those eight eight modules you know my whole thing around so the one thing everyone will have is either g suite or office 365 that i'm not trying to build right that you do you do g suite and this hooks into that i'm not trying to kind of take that down you know slack yes probably that one is a little bit easier in my opinion to rip out but if i look at our seed portfolio and when they graduate to series a that is the time when they're starting to think about getting a crm helper marketing automation system and that's i think there's probably three different pieces of software that are the right insertion points after you get g suite the next thing is probably payroll and if you look gusto is kind of like the only thing most people use today it's been around for a long time it does find i don't think it's a particularly super super complex piece of software so can you go and say cool if you're under 40 employees we offer the exact same functionality as gusto but we also offer xyz and you know zillion workshops you have a bunch of ideas let's hop to another idea um that you have give us like give us your top three ideas and we'll pick which one to go into so just give us the one liner someone should start this i i i that's cool if you think that's going to be huge i think it won't be huge i think it'd be mild but i think one of us could be wrong but either way it's a win yes agreed i think it could be huge but even if it's not it will definitely not be a it will not be a bad outcome right oh man where to start okay uh one that i really like that i also really want somebody to build is an adulting vault is this one yeah what does that mean what's an adulting fault so by the time you're out of college you have a bunch of things in your life that are like okay i have a credit card i need to get my first apartment so i'm paying rent i have to think about insurance i need to have all my monthly bills paid in subscriptions i now have internet and utilities and all these things are disparate and there is no one place where kind of all of my adulting responsibilities live and if i compare this to a product that's existed in the past mint.com which i think launched back in 2007 was kind of the first thing that said hey your financial life and financial picture is sitting all over the place can i aggregate it in a really simple app to give you that one-stop shop and i want to do that for literally everything in your adulting world and as you get older and as you have kids and a mortgage and a car and all these other things you have so many different places where you know your insurance policies live your bills live your financial products live your investing accounts live and nothing has aggregated that and i also want it to suggest things that i'm missing so it's like hey you might want to think about life insurance here are the best life insurance policies for somebody that fits your description so you monetize via referral and you know via affiliate but it also can let you know of like hey this is coming up for renewal make sure you pay this bill and you can auto pay and stuff like that can i niche this down even a little bit more so sure do you own a house i own a condo um so i just bought uh i know sean did i just bought my home recently it's the first time i've done it i didn't know anything about anything i probably still don't but they gave me so basically what you do is for anyone who doesn't own a home uh right before you agree to buy it and then someone you hire an inspector in texas i paid this guy only five hundred dollars was pretty crazy he comes through and he pokes his head in the closets and he goes all right all the electrical things work this thing it looks like there's a little mold here yada yada yada and i got a booklet that was pretty thick about a 50 page to 100 page booklet and i'm like okay that's kind of cool but even two months after they did this thing i'm like wait what is this light switch this light switch doesn't turn anything on what is this doing and in the booklet this guy has actually already addressed this um but i don't want to search this like this like actually printed out booklet um i almost switched so you're almost talking like a life manual i would niche that down even further i'm like someone should just create a house manual so i can just do ctrl f uh bedroom back corner light switch what is that where's that what's that doing um i almost wish i had this just for a home and then you could layer [ __ ] on top of that like uh what's the best home insurance which i was trying to figure out what's about you know similar to that so i i'm with you uh elaine on the adulting thing i have two ways to contribute to this idea one is how do you get customers i'm a big fan of quizzes quizzes i think are extremely overlooked um i remember uh michael burch who was my investor my previous company and he was the original founder of bebo and he he basically had sold he created a social network he sold it to tickle which was a quiz company and tickle was like a 100 million dollar company that was just doing quizzes like what breed of dog are you what um you know what city would you be if you were a city that sort of thing like fun little quizzes and then they had some quizzes that were career quizzes that would help you get jobs and that's like where they made some money and then when he left there he was like all right i'm gonna start another social network and he's like i know how i'm gonna seed it i'm gonna make a quiz and he created the best friends quiz which was how well do you know me and um and so i would create a quiz i would answer a bunch of questions about me then i would send it to my friends say take this quiz see how well you know me and then the results were posted on my profile and he got a million members in nine days uh off this quiz and their profiles were filled because they filled in a 10 20 question in a questionnaire about themselves so now they had a full profile and they had their friends um it was crazy and so i've started to pay attention to quizzes i think you could create the adulting quiz and go viral like kind of now of like you know what percent adult are you because i think most people in our generation kind of admit and acknowledge and laugh at the fact that we're like totally not adults even though our age technically classifies us as one and um and so i think you could i think you use a quiz to get a bunch of people to just see like you know do you have life insurance like yes no i don't [ __ ] know you know like what is life insurance right like exactly one is life insurance exactly and at the end of it you basically give them this little infographic that's like nine squares and the nine squares are like cool you have like enough savings for like three months of life if you needed it uh good you've checked that box of adulting um you don't have like health insurance you know you are an ex here click here and we can help you figure out like why you need this how much it costs how you should do it depending on who you are and so i think you could kind of give people a report card and then let them click in to like solve that problem for themselves and give them the you know educational referrals that they need from there i love that idea also you hit on an interesting stat that i heard before which was validated by a couple companies i was looking at that the longer the quiz the more likely people will actually continue to answer convert 100 that's crazy when people so for the hustle we get like 10 000 sign a day and we would ask them like question after they sign up and we would do like i would put two questions in and then inevitably everyone the company was like oh that's already too many i'm like no no no put five and we put five and then we put ten and eventually we had like 30 questions and it had like a 98 percent completion rate um the the more quite and not only that they actually interact with you more after they've answered this which is really counter-intuitive and a lot of like particularly startup people are like oh you know i don't want to be too aggressive yadda yadda i'm like no well here's how it works i've done this many times tested the same thing many times because uh anyways i'll skip the story part but there's an entertaining also bebo story from michael birch where he was like he put a red but i'm not skipping the story part i'm telling the story he put a red button on the site for one out of every 1 000 uh visitors so imagine going to facebook and just seeing a shiny red button in the corner for the first time and you click it and then the whole screen just went clear and it was like here's a cat click the cat and you click the cat it's like this is a bowl of pasta don't click the bowl of pasta you clicked it and and then it's like the cat's dead we told you not to click the bowl of pasta all right click the cap bring it back to life it was just a stupid thing that he had a hundred steps and what he learned what just doing he just did this for fun just to mess around and what he learned was like the first the first button you know people will usually click out of curiosity but you'll lose like 30 of people who just don't click it because they're busy they just go do something else and then the second one you lose another maybe like 20-ish percent and then after that the people who get to step three like 98 of them will go all the way to the end because they want to know how this ends um and we did the same thing for a charity project where we were raising money it was the exact same step 30 lost on the first fund 20 loss of the second one and then 98 finish the rest and uh so i've seen this several times and everybody in your team will tell you dude this is too long we shouldn't ask too many things wrong it works uh get as much as you can because once they get to step three question three they're gonna finish no matter how many questions are in the thing one nuance here that is a hundred percent accurate for consumer and 100 inaccurate for b2b for anything enterprise shorter is better but i think on the consumer side i think there's two psychological things at play one people love talking about themselves and that's why we do all the quizzes but the second which i think sam was hitting on is if i've answered 30 questions i think what i'm going to get after that is going to be super valuable right because you know me now so whatever it's going to be personalized can be valuable and it totally works what do you do at signalfire i saw your title is it just venture partner uh i'm a partner so i invest but i also spend about 30 percent of my time leading all the growth and go to market programs for the portfolio so it's kind of just me getting to exercise that muscle still sometimes i parachute in parachute out help them with some of the growth needs i have an entire network of freelancers contractors agencies for everything like hey i need a seo content writer or i need a tick tock video producer and so i can match make on stuff like that and we run a bunch of events and teach people how to do the stuff and are there like two or three partners and you're one of them basically just means you're you're one of the owners you're you're you're one of the shot callers i have investment power we'll put it that way yes i think there are five partners at signal fire absolutely let's do ideas sam no nobody cares about vc uh all right uh well no wait wait are you going somewhere with this compliment which is you're like i'm looking through these ideas you're like you're very amazing uh every one of these ideas is interesting i want to go through all of them um and they'll have me back on we'll do all of them it'll be great let's do one right now let's do snoo for adults what's this one i know what the snow is because i have a baby sam does sam do you know what the snow is no okay i'll explain this new so there's a company called the happiest baby and it produces a smart bassinet and what it does is rocks the baby it has noise it can sense all this stuff and people swear by this shawn did you guys use this yeah like my kid is in it right now while i do the podcast so uh you know the only reason i can do the podcast because the snoo is basically babysitting my kid so like you see this app and it'll basically say like oh banks is calm it's like he's sleeping in there he's not crying if he cries it'll go to level two it'll rock more to try to get him to like chill out so it saves you the step of going in and like soothing the baby make noise and rock like a human uh and it's safe because there's a big like problem with something called sids but is it is this new uh a category or a brand it's a brand it's a brand it's a brand and these things are incredibly expensive and you can only use them for a really short window of time and so there's a whole secondary rental market and resale market for these things but parents swear by this so okay let's apply this to the broad population of human adults we suck at sleeping and nobody has ever rethought sleeping from a first principle's perspective i mean first off it kind of makes no sense that we sleep with another human in the bed quite frankly like i roll over i grind my teeth you know i we have a dog in our bed too that kind of makes no sense second i want something that is temperature controlled that rocks me and like knows my my behavior that removes all light that removes my phone so i can't go and scroll on buzzfeed stupid quizzes at two in the morning why has nobody rebuilt the bed for humans and i think we have enough sensors we have enough smart connected home products today to do this so i would have been i would buy this i would have been skeptical about this but for three reasons a uh i've used the snoo and i'm like oh i wish i had this like this is great um b um you've seen a rise in these like expensive at-home equipment whether it's peloton mirror tonal like there's all these things that cost like eight sleep bed you know like things that cost thousands of dollars that you buy to improve one small aspect of your life whereas if you actually like if you told me there was genuinely a sleep pod that i could go into that would improve my sleep by even like 20 what's that really worth to me right like of course this is kind of a first world problem high class you know high class like product okay whatever yeah it is but um i think that's worth at least five to ten grand right because that's it's eight hours a night every single night getting better which is making me healthier happier you know like more productive the next day so i actually now believe that a product like this could exist um i never used one of those google nap nap pods but like i feel like that's what those are trying to be i think i would totally buy it you're spot on it's a first world problem but for all the people that are buying 3 000 bikes or like the 5 000 treadmill from peloton right that's the demographic here so i want somebody to build it that's what peloton should do honestly like because they're not going to find another bike like even the treadmill they're not going to find another treadmill there's only so many of these like places to expand they should go straight to the bed and uh and create the bed with a sleep subscription that's like the calm sleep stories uh layered on top of this well make a wellness brand out of it health is only one piece sleep is a huge component of wellness i totally agree with that can you talk a little bit about subscription running shoes because um that i mean that interests me and i have a few opinions but wha what is this so i'm a huge runner i think you are too sam and i also have an apple watch most people who are runners have some kind of connected device that's tracking all your steps and things like that and you're supposed to change your running shoes every 300 to 500 miles i have no freaking clue when my shoes have had 300 to 500 miles i can't even tell you when i ordered them also for runners you have a brand and a style of shoe that you typically stick with i don't know any people my running friends who mix and match so i'm a brooks runner i use brooks adrenaline eight and a half narrow every time i want brooks to create a subscription for me it hooks into my watch and my smart my smart device it says hey we're just gonna auto order you new shoes every time you hit like you can pick 400 you know 400 miles or x number of months and it gives me a discount because it knows i'm gonna be a customer for my ltv just went up 100x because it knows i'm gonna continually order so a they're going to get me to order more frequently i'm going to be a super happy customer because i just get it in the mail they can start partnering with other companies and doing these bundled subscription products but to me this is such an obvious product that no brand's done you could also partner with some celebrities and make it really cool i don't know why this doesn't matter let me give you the low-tech version of this um here's how you do this without the apple watch yeah you know like toothbrushes have the little strip the the little blue strip that's like this is this toothbrush has like you know been used way too much and like i like baby diapers have this too the blue little streak which tells you they peed um this is what you need on the bottom of the shoe this bottom of the shoe needs to change colors as it gets worn out and then so so you basically have a visual indicator that you have out worn this shoe it's time to order another and [ __ ] it put the promo code for your next order under the under the thing so when it wears away it's like it's time to reorder here's your code get your next shoe here's the problem with that though i know when my shoes are worn out my friends know when their shoes are worn out it's the fact that i have to go and be proactive and reorder that's the sticking point i just want it to happen i mean it's like the whole amazon button that they were trying to launch it's a qr code you just hold your phone up to the shoe bottom and then it orders you the next suit that i like anything to remove friction i i want all friction removed i would love to have a package show up how would this make money i mean because like if you're when i when i hear this i'm like yeah okay cool sounds great but as an outsider i'm like i don't think i can make money doing this like brooke why aren't you doing this this is for brooks this is not i don't think this is an introduction i was excited about this i thought you had an angle here here's an idea you can obviously bring on doing this right like correct you can start i mean if you look starting at shoe brand i think is like on the on the upper five percentile of horrible ideas i get targeted on social media by and maybe i must have clicked on one at some point but every variation of your all birds type shoes so like semi-athletic i mean i've probably seen 50 so it can't be that hard to make the only way i think you do this as an independent company is you provide the picks and shovels infrastructure for every brand to do it so you go and sell to the brooks to the nikes of the adidas to the reebok i think that's doable right uh okay let's see let's pick one more idea that you have on here what's the best one that you sent in that we haven't talked about yet that you're most excited about this will be another fun fun one that's kind of on the consumery side so i have this concept called therapunch and i kind of need to give the backstory here because this is actually funny and involves running so there's a nice tie-in so like a year and a half ago right before the pandemic i was running in the mission in san francisco at like six in the morning and it was an area where there was no people i'm just kind of going and i have a green light i'm running through the middle of the street in the intersection and this dude in a super beat up janky car comes and turns right and like cuts me off and comes really close to hitting me and i kind of jump away and gave him the like what are you doing dude look and he rolls down his window and starts screaming out and this is i don't know if you want to believe this but he's like get out of the street you stupid [ __ ] [ __ ] and i was like holy [ __ ] and i'm not an aggressive person normally but i had had a rough week and i was kind of on edge anyways and normally i just turned my head and run away but i had to take every ounce of restraint not to go and just kick the back of his car i was so pissed i just wanted to punch something and as i finally got smart and ran away i was thinking to myself there's something going on here which made me want to go and punch his car or kick his car and i was like you know everyone always tells you to go meditate go download calm go sit in a quiet room like great that's fine i need to punch something and so i wanted to go punch something and then meditate so the concept here and i think now is an interesting time because there's so much vacant real estate is you buy up and rage there's so much rage rage so much don't forget that part so much race high demand well there's also an established uh concept of these rage rooms smash rooms break rooms the problem with these are it's very dangerous you have to put on a suit you can hurt yourself there's a lot of liability and also there's a lot of cleanup so this is the exact like low-tech version it's a padded room with padded walls punching bags things to like rip and pop imagine like stuffed animals you could tear the heads off and you go and you connect to a spotify rage playlist and there's a bunch you can choose from you go in for 15 minutes into one of these things and if you guys have ever done boxing 15 minutes you'll be exhausted so you just get it all out for 15 minutes and then they take you to the zen zone for 30 minutes where they have guided meditations and they have you know spa water and you can sit and meditate so you go and get it out then you center yourself and then you go back to work sam you're our resident uh rager so uh how do you feel about this no that would make me way too mad like i'd be like [ __ ] time to go to the [ __ ] thing i just want to smash this [ __ ] right now like i smash stuff i i i like like i do break what's the last thing you've thrown or broken out of rage well cell phone i mean i mean everyone does that do i have my phone here everyone does not do that i don't know i haven't done that my screen is is currently shattered i mean i just get angry you know and i do that as well but i i like and a lot of people tell you not to do that i think it's great like you're just like cathartic yeah you're just breaking a little thing that you could replace with some money and like you're not hurting anyone i'll give you a quick spin on this idea because i also think that the the timeliness like i don't want to book and reserve the room by then it's all dissipated and now it's a task i don't want to get it sorry i'm with sam you need the instantaneous release um so so the other thing i found interesting is there's a whole bunch of these like alternative um alternative therapy things that i find interesting cryotherapy where you go in and your your neck is out of it but your body is in this like kind of like i don't even know how low the temperature goes but it's like this very cold like kind of like liquid nitrogen gas that's put against your body supposed to be great for recovery there's the float franchise which is all about floating in this like salt water bath where you're weightless and you're in this light you know deprived pod and like an hour goes by and you like hallucinate or whatever the hell else i don't know joe rogan talks about it i have a friend who gave me a pass to go do this once and so they're awesome never have you heard of it yeah yeah there's one in the mission actually i walk by it all the time i've been to that one many times and so there's and then there's basically like there's a set of these kind of like alternative things and i wonder if you could create the equivalent of a gym membership that basically says okay instead of coming to this like a gym membership is a giant box that has all the heavy equipment you're not going to buy for yourself but you can come here and you can use it and i wonder if you could do the same if you bundled these together where you bundle the different therapies together sauna steam cryotherapy float tank whatever and it's a gym with no weights and it's a gym basically for the brain to recover um and to to relax and uh and you you put a whole bunch of these things together and maybe you create a different type of uh wellness like category would you ever do them back to back just thinking about what those all are would you ever go i like what about what about a class pass for that kind of stuff because they're pretty niche today and they're expensive and it's also not like a gym membership where class pass had so many problems i could go into that but i was one of the earliest users and they lost so much money on me but ultimately they were hoping the vendors were hoping that you'd become a subscriber but for these things how often are you going to go to a float tank or cryo spa or whatever so if it's more of a one-off thing and you want to try a bunch of stuff they could actually end up making money on that i actually started going quite regularly i think the difference between san francisco and where i live now so i lived in san francisco for eight years right around the mission is it's like kind of a pain to get from a to b you know because you have to take an uber or a bus a bike or a bike um although i hated biking in san francisco um now that i live in austin i i'll just like it's no big deal to like leave work at three and then go do the thing and come back by and be back by five and get some more stuff done um and i do these uh cryotherapy which i don't think does anything but it's fun i do the float tank i love all that stuff so i do think that could actually people would do that more regularly than you think yeah if there's food i think people go somewhat regularly or like smoothies or something i feel like that might work on a side note and i've looked into the economics of these things before very briefly but maybe we should do kind of a deep dive uh these cryotherapy like uh places and float tanks places uh these guys do actually pretty well like if you just kind of wanted to if you wanted to buy essentially a high paying job for yourself uh you can you can get a location you basically buy one of these machines for three thousand dollars five thousand dollars and no no no no then they print money i think i looked at the cryo the cryo stuff and also uh the second one is um uh these dexa scan uh places um i love that they it's such it's like literally it's one employee and uh online booking contactless payments all that stuff so you basically have one person who's usually it's theirs it's their place uh sometimes they have kind of a junior person who watches it while they while they leave for half the day but it's very low labor and it's just the same machine that pays itself off in the first x uses um and x can be you know might take one month might take three months if i take six months max but uh these businesses are pretty simple and uh can do quite well have you heard of that business called dexa fit the one they're like guys in a van yeah they come to you yeah and you do the decisions they work in front of like company buildings usually and they're like hey come see you know how fat you are and then you know you pay 80 bucks and you go get scanned or 50 bucks and you go get it they're the best i go when i look every three months i would go every three months safe i would buy like a 10 turn pass or something like that it was maybe 50 bucks a turn and you see progress they are so awesome it's uh i would imagine it's a pretty expensive machine maybe 100 grand per van um they're really amazing i would love to see what the revenue is and eventually they bought a they had a place right across the street from the uh twitch studio or you know the studio show that we would go to and it was like a crappy lobby with just like a cat scan and you would sit down in there and then you're out a few minutes i love that business i would i'm curious as to how they do elaine you ever seen this i think i know what you're talking about i've never done it i'm curious with it is it telling you information you don't know when you do it the first time i get that that's a novelty but if you're doing it every three months do you not know how your body's been behaving over those three months it tells your body fat percentage right but like don't you know if it like went up this month well that's that you want to measure the progress right so like for example uh i'm working out right now my actual weight stays the same because i'm adding muscle i'm losing fat and so i'm like [ __ ] this doesn't i i want my score to show the progress i can see it in the mirror and my trainer's like dude do you need this you just look in the mirror it's fine and i'm like yeah that's true but i like the science of it too i'm like it's 40 i think it's 45 bucks to go get dexa scam and uh so me and my brother-in-law we kind of made a habit out of it and like we're just like okay we're gonna go get scanned every three months that's how we measure our progress and like you know great we're down three percent body fat like let's do it again that we're referring to it's called body spec so the word body and then s-p-e-c body spec and sam just so you know it looks like the price of these range from between sixteen thousand and forty-five thousand dollars so that yeah that's not that bad and they like they're in like like a mercedes sprinter and they have like the car wrap so maybe a hundred grand total um i think this is cool i love this company um i don't know anything about their numbers but i think it sounds so neat it's so simple the distribution for this is also good because they can partner with gyms so they partner with crossfits they partner with uh you know trainers and they're basically like hey you send it to client you know you get 20 bucks out of the 50 buck like like scan um you know for the for every first time customer that you send in and so they have like kind of a built-in referral system that makes a lot of sense i'm actually shocked to lend that you're not like bullish on this because when i go it sounds like shawn and i are the same when i it's so rewarding like i'm pretty much working my ass off literally just to go from like 20 body fat to like 19.5 percent like i just think about that number constantly i think i'm just not the target demographic at all because i've always been extremely into fitness but i'm intrinsically motivated so i don't know you know what i was gonna say though a partnership opportunity for them is future fit because they're already charging people 200 a month for literally a digital subscription to a virtual trainer and you can bundle in a lot of these other services and things like that that to me feels like the demographic because the people i know that do futurefit are the people that care about this stuff they want to see incremental progress they want to know their score constantly and they'll pay i used futurefit so there you go good job everyone keeps trying to get me to use it i'm like i don't need this like i i just i'm very very competitive with myself i have a peloton which you can see in the back and i've always been a huge runner and my mom actually won this like four years ago and at the beginning i didn't use it a lot and now i've been doing a lot more cycling during the pandemic because i hate running with a mask and i've gotten so much better at the peloton but i'm always trying to beat my own score i don't need to know i remove the leaderboard and stuff i don't care about that but it's it's my own my own score one of your portfolio companies is called tempo sean have you tried the tempo it's awesome it is so awesome it is so awesome have you not tried this i haven't tried it you showed me the videos if you had it in your garage you still have it i bought one okay so elite they sponsored us so i got paid money i just used their machine and then i moved and they freaking took it back i'm so mad at them like yeah just leave it let me have it they took it back after i used it and i was like on the number one i was at the time very very in uh fit into that hit hit stuff and i was in shape um and i was like number one in the category and i kept working my butt off to do it and i just bought one the other day i think i paid eighteen hundred dollars it took eight weeks to get delivered um and this for the listeners it's called tempo fitness or something just google tempo fit and it's basically like peloton but for weightlifting um and for high intensity interval training it is so awesome so addicting i like in building my workout routine strictly around tempo it has it's like a mirror like the the mirror thing so it's freestanding it's not like tonal where you have to wall mount it and it has i think 185 or close to 200 pounds of weights and it's got these amazing instructors that do all kinds of these hit workouts we had one of the original beta units in our office and i was pretty much the only one that used it but i use it all the time i don't have room for it now but uh sean when our office reopens you'll have to come in and try it i'd love to that's it sounds pretty good i remember sam uh the video looked cool i would say that the actual design of the box i don't know if you had like kind of an earlier version of what it wasn't as slick as like what a peloton or mirror and whatnot looks like it's not entirely slick but i actually think they're making an error but but it has a sensor on it so it like tr it could tell if you're lifting the weights and it counts it for you so it's kind of hard to cheat that's great but but it's like a cabinet where they store the weights and i think a lot of people actually already have the weight so i wish they would sell it to me just so i don't have to use their weights well it uses computer vision to not only count the reps but it checks your form so let's say you're doing a curl and you're only going 80 up it'll call that out if you're doing a lunge and your knee is going over your ankle and so part of the weight counting rev involves their own weights but all the other stuff it's essentially creating a like a dot matrix of your body so it's anonymized but it can tell exactly what your form is so it's like a real time personal trainer there plus this celebrity trainer who's doing the class for you it's pretty freaking cool you gotta get one sean they're good it's it's it's worth it but there is another downside it's 50 a month for a subscription right they all are though i think that's crazy that's so expensive and it's so expensive i cannot believe that i think it's way too expensive cheaper than a gym membership yeah i know you do that logic yada yada yo you got my money i mean i'm paying for it but i still think it's for the price of a cup of coffee a day you could transform your body yeah by the way it's ten bucks a month so but think okay think about the value you get from that versus essentially in my opinion future fit is paying for accountability so you're paying 200 a month for a person on the other end to like sort of care about you i get it but like i know what this costs them i know like i i already bought this two thousand dollar machine and like give me a years free at least um they don't make a ton of money on the hardware part they're making money on the subscription well look i'd stop using logic on me and it just let me be angry that currency is not accepted here we're like a vending machine you keep putting it on and you keep getting it back out as long as you keep paying for it i'm okay i'm okay with removing logic no i'm paying for it another great one that you guys should look at is our gotta you guys know right now we're too famous now we only use free [ __ ] that people give us we don't pay for anything anymore you know how great works the more popular and rich you get the less you play for anything so i at this point i don't pay for anything i actually stopped giving out my address because i was getting so much free [ __ ] and i was like wait maybe i shouldn't give up my home address to these like strangers on twitter so now i'm like i'm like no thank you i'm gonna get one of those celebrity youtuber p.o boxes and be like you know just send it to my manager and send it to my partner i always say like hey i would love to send you x y and z and you say yeah i i just gave him ben's address like hey will you share right right i just give him ben's address now i'm like give ben all the free [ __ ] and they're like wait you're not in brooklyn i'm like yeah yeah i have a house in brooklyn [Laughter] you can send me all the stuff you don't want to especially if anybody wants like women to test stuff send it to me i'll take it i'm sure you're you've got you i've seen your portfolio companies they're badass you probably have so much great stuff yeah no follow me at zelby.stubstack.com z-e-l-b-y it's called three things every sunday i publish three business ideas and they're i would say somewhat well researched and thought through but uh they're all fun and they cover pretty much every topic you can imagine and then also if you like unsexy businesses i do a podcast called unsexy and i just talk to founders building in super random niches like chemical marketplaces or companies that are growing the growth media for lab grown meat just super random stuff but i find it fascinating like our sister from another mother honestly when i heard the podcast really early days i was like oh my god these are my people yeah you're great thank you for coming on um all right see everyone i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want travel never looking back [Music] uh

very profitable something like 20 30 million dollars of profit on like 50 million dollars in sales something like that and using that profit he went and bought a variety of companies and at this point they owned like 20 different companies uh ranging from a bakery up to different types of uh software so he just bought this company called girlboss he uh uh bought a few others and on this podcast we're going to talk about what companies he's buying and why he's buying them he's also done a few interesting things like you ever read about how someone bought a lunch with with warren buffett uh

and me and sean we read every review and we actually talk about all of them we'll say is this person right should we keep doing this or this guy uh tease us for doing xyz should we actually stop doing that what should we do so we read all of them leave us review uh listen up see you i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back all right what's going on not too much man beautiful day here in victoria what about you uh nothing we uh i've been spending all my time on this podcast trying to make it huge we've got some really cool stuff planned and i'm excited to see it work out yeah i feel like you guys are really ramping up there's a new episode in my inbox like every single day well what's yes it's going really well and we did the math and we're like if it grows if if the last 16 months repeats itself um it'll be we'll be at a million downloads a month by like uh decemberish uh which is fine which is great but figuring out how to like hack this has been really hard and so we're just trying to figure out how to make it huge well what's hubspot what's their goal their goal so the hubspot has a bunch of cool stuff uh that they're launching basically like a bunch a bunch of content initiatives including podcasts and their goal is to reach uh a certain number like i don't remember the exact number but they say like how do we get to 100 million monthly uh newsletter reads podcast lessons things like that so 100 million monthly audience of mine and they've just done the math on you know if five percent of those people convert into hubspot customers then it makes it pays back the acquisition or something why no that's across that 100 million that 100 million is across all their content um it's not just the hustle and the hustle right now the hustle we have close to 2 million monthly or 2 million subscribers of which like 50 60 open rate so that's adds to the 100 million um and so this podcast accounts for right now 400 500 000 eventually it'll be a million a month and then if they have other podcasts that's another let's say 10 million so then we're at 50 million and then where's the other 50 million going to come from and so uh that's kind of how they're doing the math like how does it change for you going from like staring at your p l every month looking at the bank account freaking out about invoices not getting paid to suddenly going oh i don't have to do that i just have to focus on growing the audience yeah so it's pretty great like a lot of people hubspot never said this but a lot of people were like man you're only going to work there for like a few months or a year and then you're going to want to bail and frankly i'm having a great time um like i think i'm meant to start a company again and i this is my first job i've ever had but it's been really great and i can see myself doing this for a little while uh because it's awesome like and like let's like talk about the obvious which is like i made money for myself so like i can relax a little bit i uh it's not as hard like i'm working a lot long hours but it's not as hard because if i fail or screw up like i'm not going to like cost people their jobs do you know what i mean like if i make it wrong decision i'm not necessarily going to lose a lot a significant amount of money or someone's gonna have to be fired because i can't make payroll so that the lack of stress is so good have you ever have you noticed have you noticed like your cortisol levels are dropping and you're just more chill interesting dude i'm like never i've never felt that i've never felt that because i've always had there's always been so many different businesses that anytime we've sold one i've been neglecting another one for a year and then that blows up and i get all stressed out so it's been i've been thinking about this a lot but i've been going from stress to stress for and like seven or eight years probably since we sold our our one of our first companies and uh i've been thinking lately like i'm going like holy crap i gotta de-stress and that sounds really nice to not have to think about any of that stuff well the way i described it so what i describe when i like uh moved out to san francisco and like put by stake in the ground like all right i'm gonna figure this out i felt like i'd been living with poor eyesight and i finally put glasses on and i'm like oh this is the world like i could do anything i could do this i could finally see now after selling it's like a different put my glasses on and realize i had poor eyesight where i'm like to my wife now i'm like oh my gosh is this how you feel all the time like you don't have to worry about x y and z what a crazy feeling this is actually quite nice now i want to put that stress level back on again eventually but it's nice having that break um and what i think about with you is i'm envious of what you have in some regards right i think we're always envious of of other people especially our friends i'm envious that you've built this huge awesome empire that you own nearly all of it that you have virtually all the control that's very most people envy you because of that but i also think to myself wow andrew also hasn't chilled probably for a minute and that's definitely the downsides and so like in order to be the best you definitely got to wear that which you are you have to worry uh carry that worry backpack a fair bit oh yeah it's crazy and it's so funny like the numbers just get bigger right so it's like i you know i i remember in like 2012 one time we like did payroll we didn't have enough money and like my business partner literally lent me money out of his personal account to close payroll right so we've been at that level of stress and you know i never feel that now you know we have enough money to go for years or whatever it's a very different thing but there's still that feeling of like oh [ __ ] there's like 600 700 people relying on me to pay for their meal ticket every single month um and there's just constantly people problems right so yeah i've got like you know a lot of control and buck stops with me and you know a lot of the things that people might envy but at the same time like we've got 30 plus companies and there's always a problem to think about or whatever and i'm realizing i'm just constantly i think i'm addicted to cortisol and stress and this year has been extra difficult because what i used to do is i'd work at a cafe i'd like wake up like pounding stress cortisol i'd be all pumped up i'd do like three or four hours of focused work get all the stuff i need to get done but then i'd go work at a cafe and my buddies would show up and we'd start shooting the [ __ ] and go for a walk and play tennis and just just kind of half off and now with covet it's like i'm in a house from 8 30 in the morning until five and then i go see my kids and it's crazy that um just the importance of like distraction you don't get that like right now working remotely in a house you just don't get those moments uh the automatic breaks and stuff and so i'm realizing like man if i'm left on my own devices i'll i'll just stress to the nth degree and just keep working do you think and this was the last question i asked about this because i think i always try to be self-aware where it's like oh a bunch of dudes complaining about [ __ ] that maybe like is it like it's right yeah well my reply to that is it is a great problem it's but great problems are still problems first world problems are still problems but they are first of all problems but um do you think that it will ever get not or ever not be stressful like you know we you talked about dan gilbert last time this uh billionaire guy who's got all this stuff going on you said that he was pretty calm and present do you think that even a guy like him who kind of has it all or i mean people think you and i have it all i imagine but as a guy like him who we think has it all do you think that they still stress i think i think it's it's interesting i think dan's probably really stressed out or at least was because he has so many different things that he's responsible for where if he doesn't intervene it messes up there's different versions of really successful people though think about it like is someone who runs a private equity firm where they have this big pool of capital they oversee and they just buy businesses and they oversee them or whatever or or someone who like a hedge fund manager who buys stocks right you can have 20 employees you invest in apple and all these companies and at the end of the day apple does well or it doesn't and you don't influence that right i think the number of things you influence is what causes the stress and i think in our business we we go oh man if i'm not scanning the sky for you know issues in all of our businesses we could lose something or mess up and um i don't know it's a it's a double-edged sword because think about like think about like your parents or old people and like they get upset about like oh the neighbor moved in who you know doesn't want to water their lawn or someone's dog keeps pooping on their front step or whatever it is that stresses them out as much as you and i get stressed out about business stuff so i think everyone's programmed to be stressed and i think it's more about what tools you have to distract yourself from the stress and if you've got a lot of those then you're happy okay so let's work here's the tool that we're going to de-stress you perfect segway so for the first topic today we are going to talk about things that both you and i have invested in most of them are going to be things that you've invested in and we're going to span we have one two three four five six okay we're going to spend about three to five minutes depending on how interesting they are where each other whoever listed it on here will say what it is and why it's interesting and then i want to comment and tell you what i would do if i was you and you and vice versa um but i want to hear your intel or your your behind-the-scenes look as to why you are investing in this and why it might not work and why it will work like why it could work and so uh does that sound good yeah sounds great all right the first one you bought this company who we've had sophia omarosa on the podcast you bought her old company called girlboss is it just girlboss.com is that the url girlboss.com yeah and what is it so girlboss is like a like a media company for women so sophia started it about six years ago and built up this massive following started doing amazing events podcasts uh built like a social network and she i met her when she was first starting it and she'd um done nasty gal which was like this big flame out where she built a really amazing business was doing 30 million dollars a year doing online e-commerce selling or used clothes doing really really well right she didn't need the money and she ended up raising from venture to take a little bit of money off the table and then the venture investors got in and we're like hey you got to 20x this go take risks start retail stores she starts the retail stores and it all blows up a really horrible story where she had a good thing and then she risked it and then it blew up and so she was fresh off of that and she said look i'm starting this company girl boss i think i want to bootstrap it and and you know i might raise a little tiny round but i'm not going to raise venture again and so we ended up investing um and following along and she ended up raising venture again i don't know what it was specifically i think she saw like a bigger opportunity and decided to do it and the terms were great um but so she raised venture and decided to build like you know all this stuff like a social network for women building an app all these really expensive r d projects um and it got to a point where um it just wasn't working and it wasn't venture scale and so she sold it to these guys attention capital uh in new york and they like they're uh joe and uh nick right i think they're yeah they're like guys and they yeah they they basically uh they they focused on the event business they had all these massive contracts that were booked and then coveted hit and they just got themselves into a pickle where they just couldn't the numbers didn't make sense they were burning too much money they lost all these contracts and so they nudged me and said hey would you be interested in buying this and i said look i i i will buy it only if i can just buy the assets because we looked it and we said hey they've got two million social followers they've got a huge newsletter all the piece they've got a massive podcast feed all the pieces are there but the cost structure um was venture right so like they had you know a big p l they had a ton of employees and we looked at we went okay what if this company had five employees could you run it with five employees and is that how many you have now uh now now i think there's maybe seven or eight or something like that but we started with basically you know one person doing newsletter one person doing podcast one person doing social and then we just said as we sell more ads we'll hire more people and we ran it like a bootstrap business and so that's what we've been doing um and i think you know sophia uh was pretty nervous when we bought it right she's like don't embarrass me uh you know make sure you hire the right people and so we worked uh you know in close partnership with her and she's actually been really stoked about what we've been doing so that's been awesome yeah i just uh you just you just announced a new ceo i think you hired me yeah totally um so okay so okay can you talk about any of the like the size these two million subscribers two million social followers how many email subscribers uh about 250 000 so i can't share the the acquisition price that's fine um but it was it was uh you know it was let's say let's say i i felt it was a value investment based on the social followers but if you looked at it on a p l basis it was like holy crap this is a mess right because they've been losing a lot of money okay what would you be happy with this company in two years um like how much monthly revenue yeah what's cool about it is when we when we buy a business uh we're generally going you know if we're wrong about all the big opportunities and we're only right about just base hits so like hey you know we've got 250 000 newsletter subscribers can we sell 40 or 50 000 a month of ads on that if we do that we've got a good little business and then if we do that on the podcast we've got a really good little business and then if we do that on social again it's bigger and bigger and bigger it doesn't need to be huge based on the price we paid it could do three million bucks a year in revenue and be an amazing business and give us a good return i think it's a 20 or 30 or 50 million dollar a year business once we kind of do the events we've been thinking about you know all sorts of opportunities within the business um but uh what i like about it is you know if we don't do well if we don't grow it into a huge company we'll still we'll still do just fine so i agree with that assessment i actually think that so long as you're mildly competent which you are uh the worst case scenario is is two million dollars a year i would say 160 000 a month yeah based off of a quarter of a million email subscribers two million um social followers now it won't wouldn't exactly be exciting or it wouldn't be the most fun thing and that would be uh uh like if that was the worst case scenario it'd be like man we really mis missed the mark on this but you're not going to go out of business and you're probably not going to lose which is pretty good so i actually agree with that uh assessment i think that if in 10 years if you were at 30 million a year in revenue i wouldn't be surprised it would probably be it would probably be 15 uh it'd probably be 20 million dollars a year in advertising and 10 million dollars a year in uh user revenue so ticket sales more likely than not i don't know if you would be able to get subscriptions to this maybe i actually do think that there's i know a few uh people who have uh female focused communities and they do like three million dollars a year in revenue yeah i'm seeing like much smaller uh communities doing way higher revenue like we've looked at a lot of stuff for m a like for even for girl boss and uh there's there's definitely some people doing really really well with small communities so the way i'm kind of feeling right now like everything i look at um and we're i don't know if people how familiar they are with our structure but we mostly buy majority control of businesses and usually we're buying them from founders and then off the side of our desk we also do a little bit of venture investing maybe like two or three million dollars a year we've got an angelus rolling fund for another i think 11 million or something like that um so my world is generally buying 11 million dollar what hold on you have an 11 million dollar rolling phone yeah that's crazy right yeah we were it was insane we literally were like we tweeted it out as like an afterthought and we raised it in like four hours it was totally insane 11 million yeah i think we're one of the biggest ones i think so i think that um you might be like the second or third biggest i think i heard of a 16 million dollar one but you might you guys might be number one you might actually size it up because it you can it's limited just by the number of people and if you have uh there's no amount so if someone wants to do five million bucks they can do that um so there's some people who are looking at more uh we've got uh angelus doing it they administer everything and then all right who's this well i i decide right so basically i already make probably one one or two venture investments a month and it's usually like you know a friend of mine emails me and says hey i'm starting a company or one of our agencies is working with a company that we think is cool or something and i just go okay well i'll put in a hundred grand and now instead of putting in a hundred grand i put in 500 or a million via the rolling fund and i just invest my personal money into the rolling fund um so anyway so so we do venture investing i look at that as like a hobby it's kind of like roulette right it's just betting on friends having fun looking at companies um what i'm seeing in venture is absolutely insane so i've seen companies of um with with a founder who's a first-time founder with an idea and they're raising in a 40 million dollar pre valuation right like just totally crazy stuff and in the private market you know there's all this crazy just endless money and low interest rates and stuff and almost everything we look at is just bit up like crazy like to the point where we look at it and we go i don't see any world even if everything goes right where we can make our money back at this price and so for most of this year we've basically just been sitting on our hands and waiting um and trying to find hidden value and what i the way i think about hidden value is like kind of like girl boss where you look at the p l and it looks like uh you know oh whoa this is losing a lot of money i don't know how to value this but you look at it and go under our ownership what can this do and you make a new p l in your head where you're like oh i actually need five people my only costs aws and mailchimp and stuff and so we've been doing a bunch of that um and then really uh we've just been kind of sitting and waiting and getting creative right and i'll talk about this guy henry singleton later we really are just trying to um you know issue stock when it's highly valued and buy stuff back when it's cheap and so we've been looking across our portfolio and just going like how can we do m a with our stock or how can we buy cheap businesses and bolt them in that people don't understand but it's it's crazy out there right now what okay but to play devil's advocate and this is something that i'm playing with in my head of like what do i stand for what's going to be my principles for investing and i haven't settled on what those are yet although i have some guiding principles they're not solidified entirely and a good friend of mine andreessen horowitz said don't worry too much about valuation because whatever's hot will continue to be hot and you're gonna like a lot of times the valuations looking back will be like oh that was cheap but then in the middle of it it always appears to be expensive but the real winners it won't matter that much of course his lens through to looking at that is quite narrow albeit effective but narrow but what's your take on that well i think i'm assuming andrew chen because i know you're friends with him um i think they're amazing investors the some of the best in venture i think the hard part is um you know if you'd taken that same approach in 1999 it'd be really hard to be a winner right because you see the same kind of stuff happening where uh historically i think we're at an all-time high in terms of just like pre-money valuations but back then i mean there was companies that were pre-revenue selling for billions of dollars and all the same crazy stuff and the problem is that within that haystack there's an amazon right or an ebay or a google but you just don't know which one they are and so i think if you were to go out and index and buy a hundred random startups in 1999 you'd probably lose money and i'd argue you'd probably lose money today if you went out and you indexed and i to me the only way i'll bet on a someone um at a high valuation is if i know that they're a proven operator like if they're a founder who's done really well historically and i have a lot of trust and think they're amazingly smart i don't worry too much about evaluation but dude some of the stuff i'm seeing is just wacky just crazy crazy stuff is there one thing that you're seeing that interests you a ton that you've had the chance to invest in or uh you passed on but you still think it's quite amazing so you're saying that like you've seen i and i have two like ideas from people who don't know what they're doing or at least you don't know if they know what they're doing and they're these huge valuations is there anything that you've seen lately where you're like oh my gosh this thing potentially could be the coolest thing i've ever seen well i think if there's one thing i've learned over the last 10 years it's when you see something and you get lit up about it ignore the valuation and just invest right like it's like there's lots of companies that i was super excited about but i was like oh i'm a value investor i'm not going to you know do this on these terms what and i should have i mean i got i've got the ultimate like anti-portfolio of you know coinbase and uh slack and you know all sorts of other stuff i mean running an agency in silicon valley for 10 years like you just get you see all sorts of stuff right they turns out to be um big um i i think the most thing the thing i'm most excited about and nervous about at the same time right now is like crypto stuff and there's a company i saw recently that i i didn't get the opportunity to invest in but i think is genius so the crazy thing about crypto is like at least theoretically um historically if you are a member of a website like reddit let's say and you're an early user let's say you're the first hundred users have read it and you built it into something you actually derive no value right you don't get paid you're like a wicked wikipedia contributor and then reddit makes billions of dollars i know where you're going with this one for the first time ever i could start up andrew reddit and i could say hey all the people who move over from reddit based on the number of followers you have or whatever your rankings are i'm going to issue coin in andrew reddit and as everyone moves over and posts more you become more valuable kind of like the big cloud thing right now big cloud's kind of whatever bs but i think for the first time social networks and network effects are actually vulnerable to this and one of the one of the businesses i saw that i thought was fascinating was a company called braintrust and what they've done is they've basically created a really nice upwork so it's like uh you go to the website it looks like a really well designed version of gabe is this gabe yes i know gabe i uh uh a year ago when he was about to launch this and he told me all about it because he was hiring a content person um yeah i have not checked in on this okay so so i don't know what he was doing a year ago but basically you go to this website and it looks like um you know up work it's like hey hire contractors for design and development whatever you need but then it says no fees and i was like well how the hell do they have no fees that's crazy because upwork charges like five or ten percent of all the projects and what they do very quietly is they have a coin and they have a brain trust coin and they have people who uh their job is to basically be a project manager on there those people get paid in the coin all the transactions occur in the coin so as you it's almost like if uber had issued a coin to all their early drivers and then as they participate in the network they get rich and so they don't go to lyft because they're already rich in uber coin right and so it creates this lock in and it aligns incentives and before it was always this thing where it's like labor versus capital and this is the first time it's all aligned it's all um you know very theoretical and early and i don't know whether it's a good time to invest right now but it's obviously the future to me interesting and so let's talk about this so for the listeners the guy who started this his name is uh gabe what's his last name asta osteokote uh he's got a two he's got two last names him and his wife they've like hyphenated it so i forget his full name anyway he started a company called luna ostaseki or something yes yes yes um he started this thing called cal i forget what it was called cal tech or no not uh something um where it was like a lead gen site for like roofers and uh home services and it grew to like 30 million dollars a year in revenue um i don't know how but in some way he cashed out maybe his partners bought him out or something like that and he started this thing brain trust about 18 months ago i think and so i actually will would email him after this and being like hey what's going on uh you raisin because this is really cool um i think i agree with you this is really cool and he's a very proven entrepreneur now the thing i get nervous about when it comes to people like him is that will they be hungry enough to make it big i get nervous about that do you i don't really think too much about that because i think we all know like you know you you're gonna have this exit and you won't be hungry in the same way where you're like you'll claw someone's eyes out to you know to be successful you've already become successful but i think like over time it's just like you start going like okay i proved it once now i have to do it again at double the size and it's the same thing that everyone says where it's like what's the perfect amount of money it's like two or three times whatever you currently have so if you exited for 30 this time you got to exit for 90 next time i it's just i it's just the way people seem to work god that's great um all right let's talk about another one um let's do all right i'll tell you this one that i just did the other day um and this one i actually think has more reasons why it will fail than why it will not fail why it will win it's called tails um let me find the url uh i don't even know i remember kaleswriters.com so i just i'm gonna uh text it to you so on the surface this has a lot of things that i don't like uh it could it's kind of like an iphone game type of thing um it's pretty hit driven but i'm interested for in this for a couple reasons the first basically what it is is um it's this technology where authors can upload their books that they've already written and they've made it so they can turn a pre-written book into an interactive story which is kind of interesting um but i invested it for a couple reasons one i've been crazy fascinated with how authors can make more money because i think books traditionally are a horrible way to make money off of someone who spends like you know two years of their life writing something like it's pretty shitty like the difference like our friend jack butcher pro probably makes more money off his one course which impacts probably 10 000 people than a book that is read by a million people which is pretty crazy when you think i think it's fascinating though because like i'm writing a book right now um i don't know if i'm even going to release it i might just turn it into a bunch of twitter twitter tweet storms or blog posts or something or make a podcast out of it or that's what's interesting too is like when you have all that content you can take it and put it across all the different channels right like build it once put it everywhere and monetize it across all those different places well there is legitimacy there's a legitimacy around i know to hand someone a book and say this is my story as i want you know to just to for you to understand it and you know it's like phil knight is like the man because of shoe dog right i agree so that that like i don't think a book is going to go away but i think that what you should do is write a book as like a loss leader and then do all this other stuff of which tails is one of those things and the reason why this business fascinated me is because i think that romance novels and um anime and like entertainment like that for amongst young folks and particularly women it's like one of the biggest genres there is i mean it's just a rabid fan base people love this stuff i invested in this thing because i think an author can charge like 30 for an interactive book and people will read it a lot and consume it a ton and there's a company in china i'm always fascinated with how the chinese monetize content there's a company in china called well the american translation is just called china literature it's a 80 billion dollar publicly traded company that does something just like this in china and i'm fascinated with how authors can make more money i'm fascinated with bringing uh the chinese habits to america also the founder of this company had invested like 800 000 or something like that of his own money into the business and i was like oh that's cool like you're you're you're betting it i'm interested so that's a recent one i did but there's so many reasons why this can fail um it could be incredibly expensive to acquire users i don't know if the users are going to even stay for that long and uh it could be a total hitch driven business so this actually has a lot of reasons why i can fail and has a couple reasons why it could work how the i think the hard part about this though is that you've got to do all this custom work on each book like i get they've built the framework but you've probably got to have someone illustrate like a comic almost for every single so that's the technology that they've built it's like they make it really easy for yourself like you're the author to uh make it interactive so that's like the whole point that's like the technology behind it but uh we'll see if they can pull it off it's been around for 12 months so it's a working mvp but uh tbd to see if this is gonna pull uh they're gonna pull it off but that's one thing i've just invested in um all right your turn what do you got what do you want to go over which one so um we just we just uh we keep investing in this business and it's a lot of people don't understand it it's called medi-map and let's talk about any map so so up in canada yeah m-e-d-i-m-a-p so up in canada uh we have socialized health care so the government pays for it and if you want to get um uh care you can't just call any doctor and get in right so there's this whole system if you want to see a dermatologist you have to go go to a you know general practitioner get a referral it takes six months in many ways it's better because anyone who wants it gets health care but the quality of care is probably lower overall and what it's resulted in is a system where a lot of people don't have doctors and you have to go to a walk-in clinic and there's always walk-in clinics uh you know all over canada and um this this guy came to me like five years ago um because i had invested in a few other healthcare businesses and he goes hey i'm going to build this business called medi-map and basically you're going to be able to go to the website and you're going to see the wait times at every single clinic in canada and i was like well why would the who's going to fill out the times right like how are you going to and he goes well i'm going to convince the clinic owners that they want to be on this site and they should punch in you know the wait times every hour and i was like this seems insane like f off i'm not going to invest right comes back six months later and he goes hey i've got 25 of all clinics in canada using this and i'm like well like how did you do that and it turns out that every single clinic every day gets 10 phone calls a minute and all the phone calls are is hey what's the wait time right because everyone's trying to go where the lowest wait time is and so there's this huge incentive all the clinic owners went oh my god i don't have to have two uh medical office assistants i can just have one and that that one can just punch in the wait time so now this business has 86 of all medical walk-in clinics in canada and every single one has software installed wait time software installed on their computers so we've been investing in this business it's been uh you know losing money and we've been building out this network right and our thinking is once we have the network there's a lot of really interesting things we can do with the network and we've started expanding that so this is it started as a venture investment and then we ended up buying uh we now have a like a control position in it we're about to buy even more of it and there's a lot of models globally for this like zoc dock and other folks and so now that we've got the network established we have no competitors even if someone raised a hundred million bucks i don't know how you go out and convince every clinic walking walking clinic owner in canada to switch to your software over ours and so we're starting to now layer in physiotherapy naturopaths massage all sorts of other services and then we're also integrating into the booking engines for all of these and these people can pay to promote their clinic and get more bookings and stuff like that so i'm super excited about it and it's one of those businesses you might look at and go you know i don't get it where's the value um but it's it's really really cool and we're super excited about it well i'm i'm on the site and i i typed in my location i'm like oh wait they're just uh uh in canada it's been like vancouver or something i did i just typed in vancouver okay so uh so the way it works is i typed in vancouver it says crossroads walk-in clinic closes at 7 00 pm as of right now they've got a 30-minute wait time i can click and i can join waitlist and then i tell i select a uh what i'm going to tell the doctor and how i want to do the visit yada yada yada so how do they make money does the doctor say no no the doctor is totally free to use um and the doctor can i believe the doctor can like make a nicer profile so they can upload their logo and stuff but we don't make any money off of that right so the idea is over time we make a stronger and stronger network and we can start to get directly like like that one you can click to join the waitlist immediately and do that that's all free what we make money on is when you go and you say oh i want a chiropractor or i need to find a pharmacy and send in a prescription or something we can do referral agreements with all those different clinics or pharmacies but right as of right now we haven't monetized it like this is like how many people work there uh like five or six it's very small oh it's small and it looks like you got like according to similar web you guys are getting like 100 ish 50 to 100 ish thousand uh visitors a month and the traffic is mostly search and direct which is like the greatest thing ever i mean that's exactly what you'd want um so i imagine you weren't spending it it's a unique database right like there's nowhere else you can go in canada to get weightless times and i can't i'm so you're probably spending zero dollars on advertising is that right yeah we we've experimented a little bit with it but we we spend very little at this point so it's going back to like understanding a moat and going like oh this is like no one can compete with this we spent the last five years losing money and building the network and now it's like there's no way to disrupt this and think of all the different things you can build in this i always like to say you know we like to buy airport businesses and an airport is you know there's one there's one airport in the city if you want to go somewhere and fly you've got to go and sit in the lobby for an hour and when you're sitting in the lobby i'm going to try and sell you a bunch of stuff so i've got all the stalls and i can put in a massage place and i can put in a bookstore somewhere to sell sandwiches whatever and this is an airport business and right now all the stalls are empty and we're going to start monetizing it and filling in all the stalls that's a great analogy or a great story where did you learn that one because before you had new zealand businesses which i like where i made it up you made it up that's a good one i like that one that's really good uh i'm going to steal that one uh so like yeah medi-map i could see how this is gonna work if i had to guess i would say you've lost maybe six million dollars on this so far like uh yeah i think that's that's like i think exactly how much we put in that was a good guess yeah uh i i'm just doing the math as to you're not spending you're probably only spending money on five or six salaries a month plus hosting which comes out to be probably 85 to 95 000 a month you've done it for five years i just made that number up so when it goes back to if that was in the states it would have been more competitive right because canada in canada healthcare is is not privatized not a lot of people are moving into it and um and there's just not a lot of venture competition so if we're in the states we would have had to raise 30 million bucks move super fast be really aggressive but we're able to kind of quietly go out and do this and build the network is zocdoc the nearest competitor i mean zocdoc i think they're a multi-billion dollar company is that right well they're only um they're only in the states right and so um you know i think they would be illogical if they ever if they were ever to move international they'd be a logical acquirer of medi-map and i think that they're a great model right now we're looking at it and going okay how do we roll out the zockdoc playbook or or find similar businesses elsewhere i don't mean competitor but i mean it's the zoc like the most the nearest yeah the nearest comparable zocdoc and that's a multi-billion dollar company i think yeah that's pretty cool um i'm looking i would imagine the thing with with this company is going to be backlinks and what's interesting about you guys is um i'm looking at i'm looking at now you've got 750 referring domains which is actually lower than i thought you've got 7 100 backlinks but here's why it's kind of actually interesting the way that you're doing it uh none of your all your traffic i imagine is going to be search like uh it's going to type it you're going to someone's going to type in like this clinic wait time or this clinic phone number and you're gonna show up like don't call just click to see the wait time but what's weird to me is in canada do you guys have dot gov websites is gov only an american thing no we have that it's like well it's like dove.gov.ca or something but i think i think we have.gov the reason i'm asking is if this is if most of your traffic is gonna come from search you are gonna and all the some of these clinics or i don't know how the canadian uh i don't know how your guys's healthcare system is but if they're a government-sponsored or government-owned healthcare clinic i would imagine it would have a doc this is the important distinction is they're not government-owned they're government-regulated so the way it works is a clinic and they're they're challenging businesses because the government basically dictates how much you can charge per visit and the government has to approve they have to be run by a doctor so it's basically like you can make sliver thin margins um and that's again why having someone calling all the time saving money on not having someone on the phone all the time is massive for a clinic owner but here's what i'm getting at what i'm getting is is this actually could be a much bigger moat than i realized because if you're getting a bunch of gov websites linking back to you a dot gov url is worth the seos out there will correct me but something like a hundred times more valuable than a dot-com and so i'm looking at this website if you could talk uh if though if i'm looking at your uh uh medi what's it called uh medi-map i'm looking at the the clinics if they all link back to you and many of them are dot govs or dot orgs or or whatever or edus if they're like you're going to have a stupid amount of backlinks and you're going to have a significant advantage over anyone because you're just going to crush on search because google uh any govs are significantly high higher rank than a dot uh dot com and a dot edu so let's say you can get a university clinic or something to refer back to you it's going to be actually quite amazing i think and i would imagine this is the type of company that's going to be slow slow slow slow slow and then all of a sudden it's it's just good it's gonna be like oh like no one's gonna catch us like nobody nobody gets this and they go oh you know there's always virtual care like teledoc kind of stuff in canada and i just keep saying like well when you break your arm you're not gonna go on teledoc right that's a this is like a certainty like death and taxes certainty is people will always need physical doctors and yeah virtual will be 20 30 whatever but it's uh it's not going away it's gonna yeah you don't you i'm not gonna call the doctor when i have a kidney stone um so what why don't you tell me about uh hustle plus i don't know i don't wanna i wanna i wanna i wanna do you wanna do hustle plus or can we talk about uh bakery and then cyber security and then yeah yeah sure okay totally i want to talk about bakeries so you is this the bakery that you've already bought so no so i own i own a bakery um i when i grew up my little brother worked at a local bakery just down the street from our house and uh uh yeah it was his first job and i used to go there all the time i got to know the owner um i used to help him with his computer when i was like 14. and he maybe like four years ago said hey look you know my parents are getting old i want to retire i'm thinking about selling my business and i was like well i don't know the first thing about bakeries but he's got a really good manager in place and i don't want this to go to the wrong people like i literally grew up going to this bakery it's like an institution in my city i love it uh and so i said you know f it i'll buy it and so um i bought it and now i own an italian bakery in delhi and it's actually a good little business it's like that thing i always think back to of like if all this technology stuff fails and all my stocks go to zero i always have a bakery uh you know that's that's not going to go anywhere for 40 years um but the idea with the bakery so basically a couple months ago some friends and i did like a paleo diet challenge and i felt amazing but i had crazy carb and sugar cravings like i just wanted like a a treat basically and when you're doing paleo you're not allowed any grains or sugar and there's hacks around that right so you can be like okay i'm having a something that's sweetened with honey or coconut flour maple syrup or whatever those are all total bs right those all still spike your blood sugar if you eat a spoonful of table sugar versus a spoonful of maple syrup like it's pretty much maybe a little better but equally bad for you and so i started researching otherwise uh what do you mean i would have thought that that was obvious yeah i mean a lot of people think like i talked to like uh you know friends of mine and they're like oh i gave my kids these these uh really great snacks they're sweetened with coconut sugar and i'm just like dude sugar is sugar and like if you wear a blood glucose monitor it's insane so anyway so i started researching all these non-sugar sweeteners and trying to think about how to hack this and make some snacks that i could eat and like stevia aspartame all the old all that stuff and i realized there's this whole new generation of these so a lot of the old ones they have like you know stomach problems they cause dysbiosis or like stomach cramps and other stuff but there's new ones that actually taste really really good don't cause any blood sugar spikes and are relatively healthy like allulose and stevia and xylitol and so i actually found a baker i contracted the baker and i just said hey like make me five or six different things i want to see if you know i can make something interesting and i started making these chocolate chip cookies and you know blueberry walnut cookies and all this other stuff and they were insanely good and so what i would do is i would give them my friends and say hey i bake these cookies let me know what you think and they'd eat them and say they're really good and i'd say well there's no sugar and they don't spike your blood sugar and they're all healthy ingredients like almond almond flour and almond butter and stuff and so i started thinking about it and i was like um you know everyone wants to be healthy right now and they're used to going to a bakery and eating something unhealthy given the option would they choose something that's higher end and healthy but still taste the same or better so so like you know think about mcdonald's mcdonald's was the standard in the 90s now there's chipotle if you're a little more health-conscious you go to chipotle and so i was like holy crap like you know i don't really want to get in the bakery business but this seems like a great opportunity and so i've been working on developing all these recipes and i've started um are you making like god you're not money so yeah so i literally i'm literally starting a bakery it's gonna be delivery only to start just as like a beta test and uh i'm calling it euphoria and uh you know the idea is basically you know tastes as good as a normal bakery but it's actually really healthy for you and i've worn a glucose monitor i've done all these experiments what are you using i'm not doing levels i just use a dexcom but uh anyway i'm i'm beta testing it with a bunch of friends right now and then in a couple weeks i'm i'm launching it on doordash and going to experiment but it's just like one of those random you know in like a business just like slaps you in the face yeah i want this for myself that's so silly i can't believe this is so this is very you this is it i find this to be i'm i'm very envious of you for doing this i think this is so freaking cool how much um did you employ this baker full-time or what are you doing with them you just contract i found someone who can work part-time and uh i'm just doing that to start it's very like 80 20 i'm like how do i you know invest as little amount of money as possible and as little time as possible to do it so i hired a designer to do a logo on a simple website and then i hired a baker to do the baking and then a photographer did photograph everything and that's it what's your startup cost going to be uh five five or ten grand probably maybe a little more than that so again this is probably a nothing but it's one of those things like at the very least no i just think it's something yeah it's definitely gonna be a something i mean is it going to be like the thing who knows it's definitely going to be a thing i mean like you i feel like you kind of you if you screw this up you're kind of an idiot like yeah well it goes back to like if i just called it a paleo bakery even if it was unhealthy and shitty it would do well right and then you add on to that like that you know the all the glucose stuff and all the other stuff that's getting hot right now i think it's quite interesting to summarize i think this is such a great idea um i think it will be fun i think that it will make life worth like little stuff like this is life worth living but maybe it could be immensely profitable this is really smart i have a friend named david hauser who started grasshopper grasshopper i know him grasshopper a lot everyone knows dave he's a good guy grasshopper was the software company that he sold i think for 200 million dollars entirely bootstrapped it was basically like a small business phone service you pay 10 or something a month and you get a phone line um he started this thing called nut butter is that what you know what's it called uh it's like a peanut butter pouch right like a peanut butter thing um and the business is so much harder than a software company but he's having so much fun and it seems exciting um i think i think like there's a it's a double-edged sword right so um i i used to always i used to always ask people like you always get all these tech people who make tons of money or whatever and you're like well you know what are you doing with your money like are you starting any weird things like you know i love dan gilbert which i talked about in the last episode um because he went how do i make my city better right it's like doing the fun stuff with money and the way i look at this is like hey i'm scratching an itch for something i want my friends might want but i make my city better and it's just a cool you know it's a cool fun thing to play with right i think the fun part of entrepreneurship is going this should exist and making it exist um but at the same time like i've done stupid stuff like that like i started a pizza restaurant and i lost eight hundred thousand 000 doing it it was a total disaster i was getting phone calls like you know we had a we had like an alcoholic manager who was sleeping in the restaurant uh you know we had a sketchy landlord we had like just endless stress and [ __ ] and so this stuff is fun to appoint and the key that i've learned is just hiring amazing people so i only like the beginning like this part is fun but i gotta get out really quick have you heard of the barber uh motorsports museum and racetrack no so there's this guy in alabama where is it uh somewhere in alabama let's see it's in um birmingham alabama but it's in the country i think of birmingham alabama his name is george barber he's probably 80 years old now his father this guy's 80 and then his father started a dairy company so like farming dairy company just like imagine like an alabama dairy company that's what it was sold it to dean foods for 500 million dollars or something like that and they were probably breaking it in throughout the entire 50-year pro period in which they owned it he went with all the money he went and started this thing called the barber uh track and barber motorcycle and car museum and he has something like a thousand or two thousand cars i believe it's the largest collection of motorcycles in the whole world and he has this world-class track where indy cars um um like rolex sponsored formula one uh races take place on this like people from all over europe monaco all come to birmingham alabama to start and go or to go to this uh barber race track it's done so much for the community i think he invested probably 50 million dollars to make it because it's a non-profit and you can look at how many assets they have and how much cash they have and what their revenue is and it's amazing and it's similar to your bakery thing now a lot of people like you think like oh how much can a car museum and a track help the community well it actually helps it a ton because people all every everyone go i'm going to go to barber soon and take this lesson yada yada and uh that's my version of a of a of a bakery or saving detroit is i want to start like a car museum and a car track i think that's what i was starting i was talking to a friend about this yesterday but um do you remember like 10 or 15 years ago portland was suddenly cool right everyone's saying oh my god you got to go to portland or whatever the reason portland became cool was because of the ace hotel right the ace hotel was just kind of a funky hotel and it had a photo booth and a good bar in it and all this other stuff it was kind of new and i always think what's the ace hotel that you can add to your own city right like in victoria it's like what's the thing that people come to see and right now it's like uh you know some twee english shops and uh you know there's a beautiful garden here and a few other you know historical things there's nothing cool and so i've been thinking a lot about this like is it like a crazy bar or a music venue or a hotel or something like that but what's the debt what makes this place the destination because i think something as simple as that can change an entire city um i don't know what the answer is but that kind of stuff is really interesting to me earlier you brought up henry singleton i like henry singleton i've read this really good book called the outsiders i know that's probably your bible is that right i love that book okay so the outsiders um it's a great book it's about 12 ceos who are quote outsiders the the commonalities is they're like kind of quiet they're kind of afraid of the press they are typically in locations like nebraska or [Music] somewhere not silicon valley or new york and they just get pretty good results but they get it every single year for like 50 years so they'll like grow something by like 20 or 15 but they do it every year for so long that by year 20 30 40 it's like oh my gosh they're warren buffett they're henry singleton yada yada who is this guy so yeah and the idea is basically that they're capital allocators which is kind of a weird nerdy term but it basically just means they they're really good at putting their money into buckets where they can make a lot more of it versus investing in the wrong thing and what a lot of people miss is you can have the most innovative ceo in the world but if they misallocate their dollars and they put it into you know low return r d versus high return acquisitions or whatever you can have a very bad result despite being very innovative and a great uh leader and manager um so henry singleton is like everyone thinks warren buffett's the greatest investor of all time henry singleton um you know i think he died in the 80s but i'm pretty sure he actually has a better record than warren buffett and nobody really knows his name they only know it because of the outsiders there's been one other book written about him but he basically got into these very niche very technical fields where they would do like um it'd be like navigation equipment that's on like a you know a fighter jet or random little like diodes for for circuitry and all this kind of stuff but you'd find these niches where they could kind of own it or have a very dominant position in it what's there's this very simple um kind of way of thinking about investing and his whole thing was when the market is overvalued and crazy that's a great time to issue stock and to sell things and when the market is undervalued you want to be buying not only buying back your own company so if you don't own your entire company you want to go and you know buy back more stock and you want to be investing then and so that approach is you know it's very simple it doesn't sound like rocket science but i think it's a really important thing for people to be thinking about right now and i think now is a great time to be scanning your portfolio or businesses and going how can i um how can i basically take advantage of valuations right now and either you know issue stock or use my stock in my business to go buy stuff or just wait for opportunities because right now it's like a crazy seller's market which is shockingly the hardest part is the not doing anything um so in time like you have far more perspective than this you're uh more successful than i am and you're a couple years older than i am so you are just a little everything that i am interested in you are but more how are you and other people who you've met that that buy into this how do you guys just sit and chill uh how do you not do new stuff because i say to myself all the time i'm gonna i'm not gonna like pounce on x y and z i gotta wait i gotta wait i gotta wait i get so antsy and i can't like it's i it's hard well there's a reason i'm starting a sugar-free bakery right like this that's the stuff that's honestly my my secret to not doing too much is i distract myself um and you know before covet i'd be distracting myself with sports and you know playing uh bridge and hanging out with friends and going on walks and stuff now it's starting businesses and they're really small little businesses they're like hobby businesses um you know it's like um me just kind of playing with 10 or 20 000 but it's enough to keep me distracted and happy and active and feel like i'm doing something but in reality i'm sitting on my hands and building up cash and what like you so you still have enough time to do that and do the we commerce thing which for those who don't know andrew i don't know how you describe it if you started it which you owned it i don't know what the right terminology is but you have this thing that went public and is currently like i don't know what it is today but like many hundreds of millions of dollars in market cap yeah we started a business about 10 years ago we met the founder of shopify and at the time we were running a design agency and he said hey we want to launch themes on our platform we want people to be able to sign up and have different designs they can choose from and we'll let you guys sell these themes on the platform for you know 150 to 250 and so we were kind of thinking like hey it's a small little canadian company these guys seem nice let's do it and uh we started doing it and shopify just grew into a behemoth and we rode the whale and did really well and we actually sold the business in 2013. we didn't realize how big shopify would get and then we bought the business back in 2019 um we did a bunch of back for more than you sold it way more yeah think it was five five times six times so we bought it back we we and we said like we you know we're just making a big bet we think shopify is going to get a hell of a lot bigger and we made a holding company called we commerce and we started buying businesses and kind of building a mini version of tiny um within the shopify ecosystem and then we took it public in december and we're listed on the tsx venture exchange up in canada and uh as of right now i don't know if this is in canadian dollars or american but it's 663 million dollar market cap i think that's yeah i think canadian that's canadian so 600 663 canadian dollars so it's pretty big um how but i mean like you're saying you're like just sitting there not doing anything just waiting waiting waiting it seems like you're doing something well i mean i'm we started this podcast by me saying i'm stressed out and busy right so i think i i don't want anyone to get the wrong idea that you know it's more i'm filling my time when i have it by distracting myself with this other stuff and that all of the things i'm focused on right now for the most part like while i'm looking at buying businesses everything's so overpriced that i don't want to make a swing on the wrong thing so i'm filling the rest of my time with other things and one of those things is not email you told me the other day that you um for the first time ever which is actually shocking to me this first time ever you've hired someone or you've asked your assistant to completely manage your email and you said something like this is the first day i've tried it tbd if it actually works is it working and what are you doing yeah so i'm doing i'm doing two things that are kind of interesting so um one i fully delegated my email to my assistant so um i get i i've started getting over the last couple years like 200 or 300 emails a day and honestly it was just making me kind of miserable like it was just i've tried all the best practices and we even built a company called mailman that basically like slows down your email and and does do not disturb on it and stuff but it just wasn't enough and i hit my breaking point a couple weeks ago i was just spending like five hours a day doing email and i set up tech support software i piped my email into it and i have my assistant and then we have another assistant we have in the philippines and they basically monitor the email and they have a set of rules so i wrote out like if someone asks me to sign a document send it to this person on our legal team they'll review it and then if they say yes you can sign it as long as it's below this amount um if someone requests an interview go and look at the podcast see how many vol downloads it gets and if it's above this you can schedule it or whatever and so i made like 10 of these rules and now i'm getting like 20 emails a day because the only ones that come through to me are the ones where it's a friend asking me a direct question or it's one of our ceos or you know a go no go on an investment and so it just freed me up by like two or three hours and it's a classic example of like the e-myth kind of where you're like you know desperately doing all this stuff that you don't really need to be doing because you've always done it um so that's been awesome what's up and then e i don't know what the e-myth is oh you don't know that book i've i i've seen it i i don't know what the myth is i've never actually read it the e-myth the entrepreneur myth i think it is but um i think that's the best i thought see i always thought it meant electronic like it no it's it's an amazingly badly written book but it's a very important message it was like transformational for me like 12 years ago and the idea is basically um when people start businesses they don't build systems and they don't delegate right so uh the person who loves baking starts a bakery and then before they know it they're staying up until two baking and then they wake up at seven in the morning to mop the floor and then they're behind the tail all day they're miserable they're stressed and they thought they were creating this utopian business that they wanted and in reality it just sucks and they're miserable and the reason it sucks and they're miserable is because they don't delegate they don't build process they don't hire people when they do hire people they don't give them a chance and so it's all about how to delegate got it okay and what were you saying about the email thing so and then the other thing i did um which has been really fun um i i used to like i used to do this myself so i used to cold email i still do it actually i still cold email entrepreneurs that i think are really cool and i want to meet or ask them questions and like five years ago i started getting emails from young entrepreneurs saying hey can you look at my startup or can you give me an opinion on this and i used to write really thoughtful responses and then as i got more email i just couldn't respond and i felt really really guilty about this 100 i'd like to delete it sometimes i just like delete and other times i'd be like one line response and i'd be like [ __ ] they think i'm an [ __ ] 100 same dude i've done that with some people and then i've eventually become friends with them and you know how like on twitter you can see like you recognize people's thumbnail over and over there's this one guy the other day that i've seen him talk to me all the time and then i've been hanging out with this other person like through a friend of a friend like three different times now and i knew his name and i'm like [ __ ] you're the guy i've been ignoring yeah i'm so sorry man i'm so sorry i i didn't realize it so anyway i do the same thing and it kills me when you never know who they're gonna become or they could have this great idea if you just talk to them and get on the phone and so um what i ended up doing i realized i was actually doing myself a disservice by responding because i just say like you know this is too long write me a shorter you know question or whatever it is you know the douchey like yeah i'm too busy stuff like that you know what you're asking so now i write them back i have a template or my assistant writes them back and just says hey um i don't respond to these via email what i like to do is i do an ama ask me anything every month and if you if you can afford to donate to charity um you know just as a way of you know paying it forward or whatever and so if someone's rich if someone has a big company already i'm like hey go donate some money if they're a first-time entrepreneur we don't expect them to and then chris and i just do a monthly ama and then everyone gets to enjoy the answer we do so it's dude so it's been crazy so we we've already donated 58 000 to charity from this so we basically whatever the community donates we double it and then we donate it to a local charity so for we've donated 58k half of which came from people who donated and then uh it's probably saved me two or three hours a month i'm just not responding to these emails so it's like a really great hack should i copy that i think that's great totally yeah did you make that up uh yeah i think we made it up that's wonderful that is such a good idea where did you send the 56k to have you picked your thing yeah we did one one was like a uh it's called bridges for women i think i think it was um and it's for women that are transitioning out of abusive households and then the other one was a gym a local gym some guys set up a gym for uh handicapped people because there's no equipment for handicapped people in town and so it's somewhere you can go and work out if you're you know uh paraplegic or something what's the most amount of money you've ever donated or given can you reveal that uh i i've given away probably like three or four million bucks i think so wow that's crazy isn't it it's really um it's it's really crazy and i'm just kind of learning i'm learning i'm going like how what's the most effective thing to do because there's everything from like local feel good right where you can help a small number of people but you know you're making their life 10 better but you're not saving a life versus if you put the money into like malaria medication or bed nets or that sort of thing in the third world um you know i think that's what i'm kind of debating right now is how to how to be most effective with my altruism i can't believe though like you've given away that much money that's a huge amount i've like i haven't done really much of anything um and i want to um the way i started was i um i just started doing um donating to science so i'd be like as i was researching different medical things i'd be like oh this researcher is really cool i'm going to start donating monthly and i just fund their work and then over time i just put more and more into it um and then you know over the last year i started the tiny foundation if you've seen that but about a year ago i started doing this thing where i would just find people who i thought were smart in fields that i thought were important and i'd say here's a hundred to three hundred thousand dollars you choose where it goes so you donate it it can go to your own research it can go to a friend's anything you think is important and it just saves me from having to do all the diligence and work so i'm looking at it now even your foundation website looks pretty badass which is awesome yeah we hired some really awesome designers for that yeah it looks really good so for this um wow besides just like doing good uh which is like the most important thing but let's just be real is there anything that you're getting out of this um i mean what i get out of it is other than feeling good well for example so i don't i don't think i've talked about on here but um i had acid reflux like horrible acid reflux for eight years and uh i started researching it and i read tons of research about it and i was like holy crap if you get esophageal cancer you die like there's literally no treatment and so i actually one of the things i'm funding is a esophageal cancer research center at ubc and is you know so you could argue maybe i'm trying to save myself in the future maybe if i get this um but other than that it's a great way to meet interesting people as well right like i've met all sorts of amazing researchers and um doctors and all sorts of other stuff as a result but no i mean it's just i'm trying to figure out how to convert money into something other than more money and more you know more problems um last topic something i want to ask you about i don't i think it was a friend i forget who nick or my friend nick ray or i don't know who i forget who said something about how one time you bought a charity dinner or charity lunch with uh ackman bill ackman um and at the time everyone like made fun of you like who's this idiot from canada that would spend 50 000 on a lunch i mean they don't realize that that money actually goes to a charity as well but they're like oh my gosh like this is so stupid yada yada yada turns out you actually became friends with bill i think uh i don't know him but i'm gonna call him bill like i do and you guys have like done business together and i'm sure you've made that money back many times over but you have this interesting way of networking you have this interesting way of getting your foot in the door one time on this podcast you told a story about warren buffett you've told you've told me uh a couple people that you've been hanging out with like in like you've had you're like oh my gosh i just did a zoom with x y and z and they're like pretty big deal people what is your whole thing about networking i mean you're just talking about cold emailing what what you have this weird philosophy about this yeah so i'm gonna first to start with i think networking is really fun if you're an extrovert and i'm an extreme extrovert right so when i feel depressed or sad i want to be around people i want to share my problems i want to connect with people right so so i by default do this um and i would say like starting about 15 years ago um i just started i started seeing all these interesting people on the internet and going wow they seem amazing like i want to do business with them i want to become friends with them and specifically there's all these people in new york who are big tumblr users who just seem super cool you know the founders of collegehumor and vimeo and all those people and so i started uh i started doing a couple things one of them was i never eat alone so pre-covered i'd always have lunch with somebody usually locally and i'd almost always do at least one call with a random person who i either haven't met or i'm just building a relationship with even if it's like 30 minutes first thing in the morning the other thing i did is i started paying to be in the right room so i remember telling someone 10 years ago i wasn't doing super well right i maybe was doing 15 20k a month of revenue uh or something like that and i paid 10 000 to go to the ted conference and all my friends were like what the hell are you thinking you're spending all this money on this when i went to the te i have this whole thing about paying to be in the right room right so um when you go to ted it's like a secret club if you get into ted every single person that's there is someone interesting um and at the very least they've paid a lot of money to be there so they're legit and being in the room if you're in the room everyone goes oh they're legit too and so i was this like twerp with this tiny little business and i'm talking to al gore and the founders of google and you know all these amazing people and just being in a room with those people you naturally over the course of going consistently for years you end up meeting all these amazing people and making connections you end up doing business with them and so my doing that just going to ted and probably spending 30k on on tickets for three years i think it ended up resulting in 10 or 20 million dollars of revenue for my various businesses and so i'm a big fan of doing that the other thing i like to do is host events so i try and bring someone really interesting to town in victoria and then i invite a whole bunch of other people who i think are interesting and then by doing that you know you've you've basically made this collection of people where you're the host and you know you're kind of in charge of of the whole group and you get to meet the speaker and other stuff and so an example of that is i thought uh shane parish from farnam street was super interesting and brought him out to do a speaking event brought out all my favorite people from victoria and elsewhere and i ended up becoming friends with shane and now shane is an investor with us and we've done a whole bunch of deals and he's a good friend and so um i think like one of the uh one of the there's just one of the things no one recognizes is there's an insane amount of optionality and upside and just knowing great people both personally you know you make great friends but when you have a problem or you want to build a business or you need investors being able to call a bunch of amazing people is the ultimate hack and so yeah that same thing happened with bill i went into that charity lunch you know actually looking at it as like a kind of a diligence thing i had invested in his uh his company and i was going well if i don't like him i'll sell it and if i like hold on hey yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i don't know if he had you invested i had like five million dollars five million dollars invested in his uh holding company pershing square holdings personally yeah yeah and i don't do like a tough guy i mean he's not he's not a tech guy like what i had no i honestly didn't really think of it as like oh this is super strategic he's a really smart investor this was in 20 2017 i think or 2016. and how many that was a four or five that was five years ago so you were like what 30 31 yeah 31 or so um uh 5 million no matter what is a lot of money but at 31 that must have been a significant amount of your of your wealth um it is my largest investment outside of the tech businesses and you put it all in that in his fund well i saw it was basically like bill bill had a series of um challenging investments and so his stock traded way down and when i looked at it i was like okay i can buy a dollar of amazing stock so so it's really simple it's a holding company that owned about 10 stocks and if you looked at the stocks it was like lowe's howard hughes corp which is like a real estate business chipotle like really good blue chip businesses and for every dollar of stock that was sitting in the holding company you could buy it for 65 cents because the stock had traded down so much so it was like buying a dollar for 65 cents so i didn't necessarily think bill was a you know genius i thought he was a very smart investor i just thought it was a very cheap stock and so i bought it and then when i saw this charity lunch come up i was like oh sweet i can like grill this guy and see if i like him and the upside is uh 57 grand and the upside is he's just a really smart investor and maybe i can learn something from him but he doesn't invest in tech or at least i didn't know he did so i had no like i didn't think i'd be doing business with them it was like a pinch me moment when you know we ended up investing in stuff together um what happened to the the stock uh it went up a lot uh it went up it doubled or more tripled or something since i bought it so it's it's done really well it's it's tripled so the 5 million went to 15 in a matter of six years yeah i i think i think i actually it might have been 2018 it's either 2017 or 2018 i had lunch over the last over the last few few years it traded way up he's done he's done amazingly well i don't know if you saw i think you guys talked about it on the pod but he had a bet where he invested 25 million and it turned into 2.7 billion and that was in that that that holding company that i'm an investor in oh my gosh that is so funny um um so back to the networking i got distracted the pay the payoff is that's so cool i mean obviously for business it's great you surround i i really believe you're you're the sum of the five or ten of you know best friends or most interesting people around you so i think it influences you really positively um but the cool thing that that's happened is now it compounds so now i don't actually do cold emails very often i don't really like consciously network i just naturally every week or two i get introduced to someone really interesting and so now it's this like i planted the garden and now i'm enjoying the fruits from it my issue is i don't really want to talk to people like that much uh like you and i text message um and i'm okay with text like i'll text like there's like 10 people who i'll text uh you're one of them it's like other than that like i really don't want to talk to anyone and it kind of actually stresses me out because i don't it doesn't trust me out because in one regard it doesn't trust me because i don't want to talk to people like i i really only want like a small group and i only want to be with them um and like you're you're one of those people we're all well i'll just text you and be like hey do you see the new 911 get released or like we just [ __ ] right we don't we don't talk about work we just talk about uh just bought this car does this is this check out this video listen to it it's cool um but then i feel left out because i'm like i'm like sean does this a lot sean networks with everyone and he gets access to all this cool stuff and i'm like i want that access but i don't want to spend the time talking to these people because i just get nervous or you have the ultimate you have the ultimate hack though which is you you have this platform right i've started realizing this too there's a reason i come on i have a lot of fun talking to you guys but at the same time there's 10 000 people listening and a whole bunch of them are super fascinating and they're going to email both of us and say hey dude i'd love to do something with you or whatever so we just bypassed you know 10 the problem with networking is you do five boring calls and then one amazing one right so you're constantly talking to people you don't necessarily want to talk to where they don't turn out to be that interesting when you think they will be um but it's worth it because there's a diamond in the rough and i think podcasting is interesting because it lets you you basically have like 10 000 people who kind of learn what you're about and they can either decide if they like you or not and if they opt in and they like you you've already pre you've pre-like sold them almost right like when i get on the phone with someone fresh i actually tell a story about like this is how i started and this is my company and this is what we do and it's all kind of it's not a sales pitch but it's really like hey here's who i am and you can just bypass all of that via podcast or something yeah i i hear you and i what i usually when i talk to people i'll be like i'll be like hey i don't want to be pretentious or anything but like do you know who i am um yeah because like i can save us time and i won't like do the spiel uh they're like oh i listen to the podcast i'm like sick i'm not gonna tell you anything what's going on how are you um the other day i had this guy named michael loeb do you know who michael loeb is yeah he um he has an incubator like a big big incubator his house is the house in billions the hamptons house yeah so i like this guy i don't know him other than the few minutes that i just talked to him but i knew about him and i actually admire what i read about him he started this thing called synapse i think which he sold to meredith some or time magazine for uh 800 million dollars then with that money he started priceline uh he started with this guy named jay walker and i think they sold that for billions of dollars and i think it was the fastest time anyone has ever made a billion dollars like from launch to like the sale or the the public markets it was like uh like a year or something like stupidly crazy he got made all of his money there bought this huge house in the hamptons which if you watch the tv show billions axelrod bobby axelrod buys this house for like a hundred million dollars like something crazy and it's like the whole point is it's supposed to be like the the representation of greed and and too much money and that's the house that he buys well that's michael loeb's house and a couple years ago he there was this party or a charity actually a charity event and they raised like 350 000 for this event but one of his sons uh has a friend over who gets drunk and says something smart to him so michael punches him in the face and gets arrested so he's got this if you google michael loeb arrested you'll see his mug shot he's got like a white t-shirt on like they could clearly like pulled him out of bed so anyway and they found out that you know michael loeb is like this rich guy so the dad of the son probably sued him yada yada yada well anyway he heard he didn't but one of his assistants someone must make a list of every young entrepreneur who sold the company and they send you this email from michael and it's like hey i'm michael loeb i'm such a fan um and like i know this guy's like 60 something years old i'm like i don't think this is you but that's cool like it's your assistant and he goes hey um let's talk so i talked to him and i could tell he doesn't know who i am and it's it's no big deal he wasn't he it wasn't like a disrespect or anything but uh i was honored that he even reached out or his people did and he's like so i'm thinking about hosting this event for entrepreneurs are are you interested in coming i'm like dude i'm not going to be pretentious here i'm sorry if i come off that way but like you're talking to like the guy uh i host these things called hustle con i do this i got this podcast thing i've got this email thing like i've got your target demographic and he goes yeah well like i'm wanting to host an event at my house have you seen have you heard of my house like yeah i've heard of your house obviously i've heard of your house it's like the house and i'm trying to convince him now to make me a co-host and i don't think he's gonna make me a co-host but i hope he'll invite me to come to his house in the hamptons where he wants to have like 50 or 100 young entrepreneurs and i have a feeling what this guy does is he owns this thing called loeb enterprises and i think he owns 100 of it and it's very much like tiny where they invest a small sum of money into interesting ideas and they'll co-own the business with the entrepreneur starting it um or they'll own it wholly and give the entrepreneur a salary and they build up these companies and then they eventually sell them and they've had some great success they built up i think this thing called script relief uh did a hundred million a year in profit um they built up a bunch of interesting things but related to networking that's my networking story and maybe i'll be hanging out with michael loeb and whoever he hangs out with i don't know who he hangs out so cool i want to invite to that event that sounds awesome we got we got introduced to him when we were in new york last time so chris and i go to his office and uh he's like an old school almost like almost like a car salesman right like we sit down and he's like hi guys i'm michael loeb and uh he pulls out a slide deck but it's not on a screen it's literally a printed slide deck and he this is goes story he has no idea who i am he just like goes through this slide deck and he starts going line by line about it and uh i i i i thought it was really charming and he seemed like a cool guy but it was crazy like he definitely has like a shtick and he has like a system for this stuff um and it was really interesting because his house is like crazy right like i haven't been to it but i've seen photos and you know watched around billions you go to his office and you're like oh it's just like a new york office right random office it's like chaos there's like you know weird desks everywhere and like shitty chairs and disgusting it's funny like seeing um you know these in new york you can be the richest person in the world but it's like you still have to ride the subway you're still you still you still have a cramped office all this other stuff it's funny yes i saw he videoed me and i could see in his office and it looked like uh all of his employees were at home except for his crew and he clearly had like this very stereotypical like i didn't actually see this woman but this is like i could kind of tell that this person was in the background this very typical like 50 year old secretary who's had for like 30 years who like i can just imagine her with her flats and like dress on handing him coffee and like she's this nice lady i just like everything about him fit this stereotype and frankly i loved it i think this guy is incredibly interesting uh is loeb enterprises is that i think they're really legit they've created a couple really interesting things yeah i mean it's very legit and it's one of those things where you you go in and he's like oh we've got you know this company and this company and this company and you know one of them sends wine direct you know direct mail wine and the other one does like receipts and you take a photo of your receipt and send it and you're kind of going like i don't know what the bs is versus what the big businesses are like they throw a lot of spaghetti against the wall and they incubate a lot of businesses and like you said they have an amazing track record of making some of these big businesses um but uh but yeah he's he's a total character yes that guy is crazy interesting i'm so happy i got to talk to that guy um i i have another meeting with us folks um um and i'm looking forward to talking to him and if i host that dinner or even if i get to attend the dinner and he lets me invite people i'm gonna invite you because um inviting you and a few other people that's like maybe that's like how i'm gonna look legit to this person um super fascinating i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to travel never looking back [Music] uh

in this class there was one guy who was always talking he would raise his hand first thing for every single question he had a big opinion on all these topics i'm like dude how does this guy know about all this stuff and he was just super into the internet and um at the time my head labeled this guy as a loser i was like wow this guy's like this over eager student who's like kind of a know-it-all and like kind of sucking up to the teacher and like why is he so into this wow what what a loser he spends his nights of researching the like pros and cons of naturality okay now fast forward now that's me i'm that loser i was just late to the game and that guy dan ended up joining coinbase as one of the early employees i feel like i could rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back what is your rating of today's episode uh i'd go a minus um we rambled a lot but i kind of like that that we go into different topics i mean we're everywhere pod group hacker new stuff crypto for hacker news the origin stories of product hunt 75 hard tony horton sean pouring his heart out at the end we got everything in there what was your top two favorite things um i like talking about like the origin story so uh product hunt how ryan kind of hacked his way to growing that that was kind of cool um the p90x origin story as well that was kind of cool i have to look up that youtube video that sean mentioned that was definitely interesting listeners let us know if you like having this up front um let's get to the today's podcast all right what's up what's up sorry i was late i was uh sitting here working podcast bro nobody knows you were late um i'm never the late one i take pride in that and i uh was just literally sitting here working and i had no idea i didn't even look at them the funny thing is i was also two minutes late but um when i saw your message that was like uh hey sorry i'm running that i'll be there in a minute i was like boom hop i need to hop in there now so i'm there first i'm not typically the late one but i was but i will tell you a few things that i was working on so just a quick recap i'm working on some growth stuff so i want to run just a few quick ideas by you this will take a second but first yeah so in the last whenever we launched however long that's been not including month one to month two because it was like a 500 percentage growth rate so i'm not including that we have grown on average 10 a month okay okay this month uh april's not over but if if you take the average of the trail in three weeks and give it a fourth week it's going to be about 400 a little bit over 400 000 downloads which um if you so if you take that multiplied by then uh to january so we're going to hit a million downloads a month by around january at ten percent growth rate if we keep going at this rate yeah um so right now we're on pace for about five million downloads a year and then what you're saying well it's it's more hundred thousand downloads a month that's five million a year that's a that's assuming zero growth right right with the with the growth it'll be like six million or something like that more seven eight ish okay yeah because the last the end of the year is going to be starting to get 800 900 a million downloads a month and dude if people start commuting they need a little they need a little good good good in their ears while they're commuting that's what we needed we took a 20 cut i think when cove happened yeah i saw the numbers dip and then we rebuilt from there so the the current growth rate is actually quite good it's just like it's just this is the same thing of like if you just focus and just do the same old same old over and over and over again it's gonna work but of course we wanna expedite that and so the things that we're working on is we've already talked about what we worked on but let me bring up a few things first i actually think that we need to be a little bit tighter with our content meaning we're like i don't watch sports but i know you do what are like the sports shows where they like go through topic by topic and they like you have like a time limit yeah like pardon the interruption they do that where it's like five minutes it's like all right we're talking about and they always have like you know the [ __ ] people care about or you know they have these these little like names on the side and it's like you kind of want to tune in to hear what they're going to say about x and what are they going to say about why so um i think we should start doing that and i'm trying to figure out how to do it but uh i i would like us to we're going to start i'm going to try it for an episode and i'll coordinate it next everything that is on instagram and on youtube we have to drive all traffic to itunes not to spotify even though a lot of people say they listen to spotify the numbers are more people just barely though listen to itunes but if you click subscribe on itunes it automatically downloads and we get credit for that whereas spotify it doesn't do that so gaming the the system and playing within the rules that's the way to go and we currently are not linking to any of our itunes stuff finally um or no the second to last thing is recapping old stuff so we have 170 episodes did you know that i didn't know that it's a that's a lot yeah um and so what i'm gonna do is go through all the old ones and bucket them into categories and we could re-release them just with the new intro because right um i think uh they'll be great dude that's that's really smart if we basically take our best episodes from earlier when we had half the size of the audience and maybe we cut off some [ __ ] if it was like there was something dumb but we just take the you know in the mo like last year this month if we had three good episodes and we just say boom we're bringing back those business ideas and re repackaging them in a way that's better and we sort of re-release our greatest hits uh i think that's a good idea what i would think is the fact i think that will work but what i was thinking of is grouping it so uh let's say that in episode 5 and then 34 and then and eight we there was a religion based thing like a church like make a religion the new composition yeah yeah so you do that and the reason why is so you can create a how-to title because what i've looked at all the data anything that's how-to related gets more than pass uh more than other stuff speaking of which smart and this is the one of the last things we can re-title old ones to be more click i'll [ __ ] say it click bait headlines um and then last but not least alex garcia on my team who's been going wild on twitter is gonna join uh the podcast team a little bit as growth uh and then we also are hooking up with hubspots uh they've got a team that or an outsourced production company that i want to look into uh and they have claimed that if you get a lot of like if you increase the production value significantly even on [ __ ] like this it increases downloads i don't believe it but it's interesting right well we're going to throw it all at the wall and we're going to see what happens um speaking of growth can i transition to an app that's growing that i want to talk about or or we can actually we can do your rundown of the things we're going to talk about on this episode so i'm going to talk about some things that are in the fitness space so um this app 75 hard and how it relates to p90x and a whole bunch of different fitness things trends that i've seen so i'm going to break that down in detail we're going to talk about um hacker news and basically niche news websites and you have an opinion on that and said why and then we might talk about mvnos i'm not sure if i'll get to it today did you have any other ones that you wanted to talk about and what was your last one nbnos this is when you basically can start your own cell phone carrier company uh it's pretty cool uh there's much stuff i think that that that actually probably might be a lead for i think next one because that's a pretty big idea i think it's really interesting and i and i and i what i did this week is i actually just researched everything you had and i have points and counter points and i didn't research that one because it's very interesting can we wait for the next one it takes a lot yeah right and instead go to uh this teachable for devs thing because i have some intel for that so i went and got some intel on that i went and got intel on uh 75 hard and i think the most interesting is the hacker new stuff i uh i went and talked to a friend andrew your friend our friend who owns uh a company in the space and they got all his uh numbers okay great all right where do you want to start we can start on any of those topics hacker news okay so so i was looking at i saw this tweet from this guy dan romero and um dan romero actually it's kind of a funny story i'll just leave in with a personal story so when i was in college i don't know when you were in college were you trying like what was your strategy were you trying to take the hard classes the easy classes what you're interested in yeah so so if you could take so some people do the hard ones some people do what they're most interested in and some people like me we're just looking for the easy way out yeah and it sounds like you're the same and so i need to uh rate my professor i use rate my professor and i'll find the easiest classes um i would find out what classes the football players and the basketball players got to take because uh those are the easy classes so like rocks for jocks was the code name for this uh class i was like geology but it was like the easiest [ __ ] class ever i got into this class rock i don't know how i was genuinely trying to take a uh like a interesting class about sports sports psychology sports medicine or something like that and it turns out this was a class only the female basketball players at duke were in so there was 10 students they were all the female basketball players at duke the class never i looked at the schedule like oh there's no classroom where does this where do i go where do i go for my class i email the teacher he's like there's no physical meetings for this course i don't know how you got all this but he's like you just need to read this one book it was the lance armstrong book um liv whatever his book was called and at the end of the year so bring that one book which is like the easiest [ __ ] book to read by the way and then at the end of the year you write a two-page report on it and that was the whole class no you're so like sorry duke you know you definitely do the thing that all schools do with education i i get that why it's cool when you're a kid but also as a kid and now as an adult who's gonna send his kids to college i'm like what a waste waste of money what yeah dude i thought i hadn't hit the lottery i was like one athlete in college and they made me take i was a runner mind you they made me take gym and the gym class was aerobic walking it's like if you got to the classroom you're done you show up and then you go for a walk that it was called a robot and i was like an athlete so okay so anyway so in that process one class that i took that i was just trying to find an easy class was called like the internet or something like that i was like oh bingo i know about that one let me give that one and at this time i'm not thinking like i'm not who i am today right i don't i wasn't thinking about business i didn't think i was gonna go into the tech space i thought i was going to be a doctor i was a pretty i was very average student like b minus student uh very lazy and that's who i was and so i go to this class and in this class i'm basically just there again because i'm trying to coast to an a in some easy class that's called the internet it can't be that hard and it really wasn't that hard it was a discussion about like internet topics like net neutrality and stuff like that and i didn't really give a [ __ ] i just sat there quietly like doing the crossword puzzle in the like school newspaper eating chick-fil-a in this like classroom hoping the professor never calls on me but in this class there was one guy who was always talking he would raise his hand first thing for every single question he had a big opinion on all these topics i'm like dude how's this guy know about all this stuff and he was just super into the internet and um at the time my head labeled this guy as a loser i was like wow this guy's like this over eager student who's like kind of a know-it-all and like kind of sucking up to the teacher and like why is he so into this wow what what a loser he spends his nights of researching the like pros and cons of net neutrality okay now fast forward now that's me i'm that loser i was just late to the game and that guy dan ended up joining coinbase as one of the early employees and he basically helped brian armstrong the ceo of coinbase was kind of like did this tweet storm the day they went public right they go public at 100 billion evaluation and he's like talking about the journey he's like when we started this you know it was such humble beginnings nobody knew about the space blah blah he's telling and then this happened and then dan romero came on board and like helped break us into europe and that was a pivotal moment for the company where we became like the only crypto company that was like partnered with banks in europe and i was like oh my god it's that [ __ ] guy from my classroom like oh holy [ __ ] he made it and uh you know i bet this guy you know banked tens of millions if not a hundred million dollars plus easily just on coinbase and if he owned any bitcoin along the way which of course he did because he he joined in 2014 and if you're a believer at that time you probably grabbed some so anyways that's my short story of like wow if you're a college student listening to this now just be the nerd now trust me you're going to want to be that nerd later and uh really think through what are you what are you optimizing for like ease or like learning something like doing something interesting for people i think we have to send this podcast to dan i think you should apologize i i will issue he doesn't even probably know who i was because again i was this [ __ ] silent guy eating chick-fil-a in the back of the class never said a word i was just judging him in my head and i i do apologize to dan for judging him uh and clearly i was wrong and he's done amazing so anyway he he put out a tweet i follow him and he was like why isn't there a hacker news so if you don't know hacker news there's this website that people just post links it's like reddit but it's just for engineers reddit but only one forum and well it's not a form it's like you post links and it's all nerd culture internet your startup culture we you know back in the day we used to get the newspaper every day and open it up and like my dad would go to the business of politics section i would go to the sports section well the internet just made it so that there's an infinite number of sections and so now if you're an engineer you would wake up and you would maybe go to hacker hacker news every single day same and um so anyways it's cool website it's you know started by paul graham and it's sort of baked into y combinator um i i've i've done an exercise by the way i'm trying to like what would you value hacker news at um and i think it's sort of priceless i pretty much think there's no price where paul would sell hacker dudes um no because he's probably a billionaire and he loves it but if you were just like a normal guy and you had a valued off revenues i think it would be worth 50 to 100 million dollars i bet you it can make 8 million a year in revenue with no employees and i bet you it's been capable of doing that for about 10 years yeah i would say easily 100 million dollars because it's also the category leader it's the end of one in its category anyway so um dan tweeted this out he goes why isn't there a hacker news for crypto you know like any like discussion for all the interesting things that are happening besides the price which i think is like the key distinction here um which is that almost all the conversation there's a lot of places that talk about crypto and they're almost all just tracking the daily price moves like over the weekend crypto went down like 17 and so everybody was like talking about the price and in reality there's a whole lot of other interesting developments technologies kind of like usage um that's happening that's not price related and you almost need a firewall to say look at in this forum you don't talk about price because otherwise price is always going to dominate the conversation uh that's just the nature of crypto and so i thought that was kind of interesting i started looking into some of these and i guess like for me i would say like there is an opportunity for somebody to create the hacker news of crypto and so i i'll throw out a couple that were pretty cool that i found one is casebitcoin.com and this is basically a website that's just it's just a dashboard of stats so it's not like news and links it's just dashboard of stats that's basically saying um this is the case for bitcoin it's like bitcoin is now work you know 10 of gold market cap here's new here's the top headlines about pro bitcoin is this a pro bitcoin dashboard remember that time that you made bitcoin headlines because you tweeted that you're putting 20 of your net worth into bitcoin and someone wrote like entrepreneur and investor sean perry and then you didn't i don't think you did put twenty percent of your network no i did i did i i tweeted i was putting 25 i ended up putting 20 and then it grew the price started going up so fast that that quickly became it's now like almost 50 of my net worth or something so it's you know it ended up being more but but it was ridiculous that there was news about it because i think they thought i was much wealthier than i am uh like i'm not going to move the needle it crypto i could put 100 of my net worth in it it was not gonna move the needle of crypto crypt was too big and so that was funny my actually my college friends texted that news article to me this week and they're like whoa what what is this by the way what have you become yeah and that was like before you actually got famous fame i mean you're like kind of a big deal now and that was like pre big deal well that's part of the strategy of becoming a big deal was uh carry yourself like you're a big deal right me announcing how i'm moving my net worth around is sort of like carrying yourself like you're a big deal even before you are and people start to like they just accepted my my implication that i'm a big deal for tweeting like i was gonna like calling like my car my furniture assets and just start using words like that [Laughter] so i was looking at some of these websites cryptopanic.com is a cool one um anyway so there's some of these nothing i would say has has broken through as like the place where people who care about this long term and are not they don't want to get caught in the price roller coaster day to day where they go all right so i'm gonna pause there that's just the idea hey i think somebody can create this i think maybe pomp or somebody who's like a central figurehead in crypto similar to paul graham maybe pop should be creating the hacker news for crypto that is specifically not about price um i i think that would be a smart move if i was pumped i would consider doing that uh but you had some thoughts on these types of businesses and i think that's where more value will come so so go into yeah so let's call these aggregators i guess because you're not actually creating anything but you're aggregating and in a the hustle is like a a is a little bit of an aggregator we we create stuff but we aggregate a lot um so i know a little bit about aggregating aggregator businesses and i think that they're really really great if you can have them if you can make them uh i was with ryan uh what's his name ryan hoover the day before he was launching product hunt which is ultimately kind of like an aggregator and he totally and he was telling me about it and i go oh this is really dumb this is not gonna work uh i was wrong it worked out wonderfully he did a really good job um financially it was mildly successful but it was culturally incredibly successful and could have been even more successful we owned it for a long time but anyway um now i went and talked to andrew wilkinson who's going to be on the podcast actually tomorrow which i don't know for the people listening when that actually airs tomorrow the next day something like that he bought this thing called web designer news so it's actually just web design i think it's just designer news oh just is it justice that are you sure i think it's just designer news.com yeah i'm pretty sure it is um let's see oh yeah sorry not web designer uh designer news okay so basically this was a hacker news thing um it was just for designers it's like it was literally a clone like it looked almost the same except for then hacking is kind of ugly they just clean up the design a little bit but it's the same idea yeah and it was pretty uh pretty good when he bought it uh and i asked him how's it going and he said it's basically dead uh it's done so uh i think he got the money back from what he paid for it as in he earned that much back but he i don't think he anticipates making a lot more money and what i thought was his case his opinion and what happened my opinion of what happened to his site is actually kind of the same but basically uh here's what he told me he goes the issue is you have to get a whole bunch of people to visit daily and you're only as good as your posters because it's social news and there's endless amounts a way to game the system with a bunch of bots which oddly people do it a lot so you need constant moderation and algorithms which is very expensive to hire the devs to make that and then you also need real live moderators which also is expensive and then if you have any period where the content gets bad then everyone just moves to red reddit so it's a little bit like lightning in the bottle and it has this kind of magical network effect but it's hard to catch lightning in a bottle is what he said and uh i actually agree with that and so my point is i actually think that if you can build this it is one of the greatest things that you can own um and there's a few examples of this so there's tech meme which is also these are all uh things i'm fan of so it's all gonna be a little bit but tech meme i i can't submit to it as a user right it's not social news they they curate it themselves well it solves the same problem yeah it solves the same problem for the end customer which is you go to a place and you see all the interesting links of the day in my niche that i can the same habit and the reason why it's that it's important to mention tech me because with hacker news as with reddit uh the creators or the owners of the site can actually just submit a ton of fake stuff that you wouldn't even know they submitted and it would look populated and that's in fact how reddit ready got started so the hard part is there's a great video by the way on youtube if you want to see the how reddit got started their fake until you make it strategy where they had 20 or so accounts of different names and they were posting every day on the subreddit like from 20 different personalities to try to make it look like there was this great young community of interesting people and then they described they were doing that for like i don't know a couple months or something and then they described the day where they went on it and just it was all happening before they went with their fake accounts like the real people had built up enough steam had learned like monkey sea monkey do they learned how to behave here and they were just posting the links and commenting and it was like wait dude that's not my account this is a real account holy [ __ ] this is actually working and so that's how they start it takes a lot of time and reddit was is 10 years old so when they were get i mean like the amount of websites that existed versus then then versus now they had a lot less competition it was still really hard but what i found with this okay so there's tech meme tech meme just automatically pulls headlines based off what's most shared on the internet and then another example is let's run so let's run.com the listener or the owner of let's run.com is actually a listen to our podcast and i'm a big fan of fletcher.com and it's basically the same thing people submit articles and they comment on on it that's in the running niche yeah it's like dorky runners long distance runners very dorky so so let me tell the story of product hunt at the beginning how how ryan did it right because i think for a lot of these it's one thing to hear oh it's like i would agree with you these social news sites social news aggregators are amazing when they work and they usually don't okay so how do you get it to work well i actually got to see ryan build product kind of from the inside from day one and if anybody doesn't know like there's a funny article basically ryan was interviewing to come work at monkey inferno where i was the ceo at the time i was trying to recruit ryan because i loved his blog post and he was interviewing with us and he got the final interview and didn't didn't make it um and i kept in touch with him i was like hey you know sorry it didn't work out but like i'm still a big fan of yours and uh you know i want to give you the feedback why it didn't work hope that's not salt in the wound but you know if i'm you i'd be curious why did it why didn't i get it and uh you know i really do want to keep in touch and then the next week he was like starting product hunt literally i think one week later he launched product hunt and uh and i remember like you i was thinking oh this is like cool but this is like just some pet project it's not gonna go anywhere why does he come work on the real [ __ ] and in reality product was more successful than anything we did in the lab so you know he won in the end but i would say what worked for him so he started it on this thing called linky dick uh which was like an off-the-shelf little social news tool i don't even think it's still around it's not we started it there yeah it was like an email it was so weird it was like so the way it worked was it was like hacker news it was a list of links but then it would send a recap to all the subscribers of that board like an email recap so even if you forgot to go to the website you'd get the wrap up automatically that was kind of like a killer feature there because you're trying to build the habit of people coming but they first like if you could just deliver them value through email this will work um so i would say like that was one like nice thing he did he didn't need a tech he didn't need an engineer at the beginning he used linky being and linking the key was that they would email the recap then he only invited like friends that he had developed that he knew were as nerdy about products as he was so i think i'm user number 15 or 17 of product hunt and it's because i was one of his nerdy friends who really like geeked out about new apps and new products right that's what this podcast kind of right this word product or like now you'll see people like oh i'm a product guy i'm almost that popular then i'm almost positive people didn't really use that word or phrase or if they did people were like what are you talking about well it was around like product manager was obviously a phrase people talked about products but it wasn't as like it wasn't seen as like an anime fan or a sports fan like it didn't seem it wasn't like a thing and he really said it a lot like this is for people who geek out about products that was his tagline at the beginning and that's why you should join this phrasing i knew what he was talking about but i never heard anyone say that and and so he definitely kind of created a little bit of a category he made it cool i don't give him that i think that he made it cool to do this thing so then he he curated the initial people and they were cool people so it was like because he had been blogging for four years before that he had built up a nice network in silicon valley so that again that's the hard work that happened before that prepared him to succeed so then he invites kevin rose he invites you know a bunch of interesting people onto this thing and so people are sure and he he said i set out to rule so just like i was saying for crypto hey this is for all crypto news except price he said that for product he's like this is for cool new products don't post facebook and instagram like we all know about that this is for the [ __ ] that you don't think the rest of the group has seen yet so that's where the real value came that's what you would get here that was different than going to techcrunch or going to the app store charts or whatever it's like here you were going to dis discover the new thing first and uh not gonna see [ __ ] that everybody already knew about so it kind of made it an insider like it's set the level playing field of like it's like if you were creating a wine club you would say like you know this is for people who actually know about wines don't bring you know the seven dollar yellowtail you know wine here and so anyways i thought you got that right then he made it where you had to be whitelisted to participate in the community meaning the average person could not just go post so that solved the bots problem and the moderation problem because he was only letting trusted people post and anybody could view and that that in this double effect of it was now exclusive people wanted to get in they would beg to get in they would prove themselves and if they got in they would be on their best behavior so they wouldn't get kicked out and the last thing he did was he was pretty maniacal about curating the the community and the products like every morning he would wake up i don't know he's like kind of a robot he like wakes up at 5am or 6am every day like he's one of those guys he's like super productive yeah type of person and um good habits you know he would go to phil's coffee shop he would sit down on his laptop and then he would immediately be scouring twitter anybody who mentioned product he would thank them anybody who posted a cool product he would say hey i'd love for you to post this on product time he wouldn't do it he would tell them hey this would be really cool if you post a product now i just gave you access and so that like built this habit and he did that every goddamn day for like i don't know nine months or something like that before he hired a community manager still probably crushes i i use product hunt regularly i don't actually know the numbers anymore because i don't i'm not sure but i bet you it's still quite successful and it could potentially be successful for 10 years plus right if you've ever seen somebody build a fire without matches like i watch survivors that's like i'm not a i'm not a camper i don't know how it works but on survivor this is like one of the mainstays is build a fire that's how i view building a community like when you build a fire on survivor it's like first you're gonna like take the flint and you like just gotta you gotta shave the magnesium off the flame boom boom boom boom all right now you got enough of that and now you're gonna like you know add the next piece you're gonna like try to get that to catch and then as soon as it catches you gotta very carefully don't let it like extinguish it's so like fragile at that time you gotta start adding the little like brushwood or whatever i don't know the words but like there's a certain type of thing you add next then you add the sticks then you build and now you have this raging bonfire to me that's like what building a community is like i've seen the people who actually do that that like really hard work of shaving the flint first and i'm like oh [ __ ] that's what it takes to do these like once these communities are actually up and running i've seen it once or twice now i've seen you do it as well with trends where you were posting every god damn day in the trends group yeah for i don't know how many months that was your flint phase where you were just shaving magnesium onto the water so let me tell you about something that we're launching at the hustle i you guys can use it or not i don't care i'm not pimping it out right now uh but it's related to this so what we're what we are launching tomorrow on tuesday this podcast on wednesday so it's actually already live but i don't even know if you're gonna be able to find it yet but anyway it's called hustle plus and what we're doing is we're kind of launching something just like this because i'm obsessed with these types of products and i love these things and so uh when a user signs up or they can click out of the email once they're already a subscriber and they can tell us they can either explicitly tell us what they like or implicitly we can see some of your behavior and then we're gonna have a section of headlines and in order to get those headlines we built this tech that crawls the internet and finds the most shared stuff and shared headlines and then let's say that you tell us or you click on a bunch of articles related to media and we've tagged all the links like this is a media this is a media and a bootstrapping story whatever right uh you're gonna get those links in your email so you're gonna get the hustle which is like 2 000 words of like editorial stuff but you're gonna have one huge section with 10 or 20 just headlines then we're having we're hiring a team of editors to write a one sentence description of that article so it's part uh human part machine telling you interesting stuff right very very similar to hacker news tech meme things like that um so that's actually we that's cool yeah and so um we're i'm doing that because i love these types of things so it's basically a hack it's very similar to a hacker news not so much user submitted right now but kind of a similar idea so i love these businesses and we've talked about drudge report i think that if you can get this to work it takes a ton of work up front very little work to maintain yes yes exactly um okay so let's let's switch topics let's do one of the other ones 75. 75. okay so you've done a ton of research about 75 75 hard i've had so many friends talk about this friends that mostly are not fit and this has inspired them to get fit uh okay so tell me about that part i i i haven't heard anybody only ben has told me about this oh my gosh everyone is talking about this man so do you remember um van trump report the newsletter guy i taught i told you about this guy who's got this uh newsletter that crushes it and an ag tech i became friends with a son his son lives in kansas city he's kind of talked to the southern accent he's not like a techie uh he came over to my house because he was visiting in texas he's like hey i know you have a gym i'm on my last workout i need to come use your gym can i use it and then another friend sujin patel has been doing it and 75 hard has taken over like my friends and they commit to it like a religion like they don't miss it right so describe what it is to somebody and i then i have a bunch of thoughts around so 75 hard uh i think what it means it's only got like six rules it's basically you have to do for 75 days two workouts a day each workout needs to be 45 minutes one workout needs to be outside i don't think either workout needs to be particularly hard the only rule is that you have to sweat uh the second rule is you have to have a diet for all 75 days it doesn't matter what diet you just have to do it and that might be it is that the only rule i think that's it so so i had heard about this uh ben told me about this a little while ago and then today he's like check out the app charts and it's the number three paid app in america right now i said wow that's kind of amazing and so i started looking into it and i actually didn't do a ton of research on 75 hard but i researched this category i'm very interested in this category i finished the story on 75 heart it started by this guy andy i don't know his last name you wrote it here i don't want to you know okay everyone makes fun of me because i can't say stuff he's actually based out of right near me fenton missouri he has a supplement company called i think forma and it does about 200 million dollars in sales he was in my local newspaper because he um they like they bought a 20 million dollar building and invested it and made it nice so i think they're it's legit he's had several supplement companies because i was like who is this guy because if you see if you google them it's like it's one of those red flag type of profiles like entrepreneur speaker bestseller coach to celebrities you know it's like oh [ __ ] you what have you done who are you it's screaming not legit but he is legit exactly and i i mean i can't [ __ ] on it too much like i'm a big tony robbins fan and if you were to describe tony robbins it'd be very very similar and like but you kind of got to dig in be like i definitely what i don't do is i don't take that at face value right cool so what are those businesses okay great what is this book like you know let me let me check this out let me let me get a sense here so this guy's got actually the top one of the top podcasts in our category in the business category um it's called mf ceo or something like that oh my gosh um you know mother f and c or something he's got a big instagram following so who is this guy from what i know which i just did a very quick dive actually i'd love to have this guy on the pod um he he basically he's uh he started a couple supplement companies i think first was like a brick and mortar supplement company called something supplements super supplements or something like that and he's got he's done that two or three times his third one is called form one and that's i think the biggest one it's been the most successful and you know the hook or the tagline is like you know these brands do over 100 million dollars a year so okay he's in the supplement space he did well with that great and then he like translated that into like a life philosophy and i think he preaches kind of he's like a bit of the jocko willing like kind of school of thought which is just like you know it's hard man you gotta work hard yeah man up do it grind uh hustle blah blah those are the words right so he's like gary v if garyvee was like jacked you know and so he's like you know in that that fame that's the outsider i haven't got i have not drank the kool-aid of what his stuff is that's my outsider quick point of view okay great but i started thinking about this by the way i just wanna i'm gonna cover your ass here sean sounded and sort of died a little dismissive of this guy i yeah i don't think you are trying to sound that way and neither am i i think this guy seems like a good dude i view it very much in the like i can have two thoughts at the same time one thought is oh when i hear this stuff it's usually a bit of hand wavy and usually these people are kind of like stereotype kind of caricatures um but also they're probably like actually giving out good information inspiring a lot of people have had great success in their life and live up to a lot of these things and like i think both of those are kind of true like i kind of make fun of gary vee but i think gary v has built like kind of an awesome brand and an awesome company and he's an awesome guy like you know like i don't know personally but i can simultaneously make fun of the character while also being like you know respect you did your thing like you did the thing you want to do and that's not easy most people do nothing so you know props props for not not just doing nothing but doing something very unique so so this space so i'm very interested in this um for kind of a reason i've actually considered launching something like this so that's why i looked into it uh so 75 i'm very interested in these time-bounded challenges time-bounded programs so the big one that i personally had experience with was p90x so i don't know if you did you ever do p90x of course tony what was his name what was the guy named tony horton tony horton of course okay so here's the kind of back story of p90x i think it's interesting there's this company called beachbody and what beachbody did was it was started by this guy carl deichler i would consider him our billy of the week so he's a ceo he's worth about 600 million dollars and this guy is kind of the king of infomercials and the king of of us of sort of at home fitness so he created eight-minute abs um you know he he created eight-minute abs which is like he was inspired by buns of steel he like loved this like branding of a fitness program and he he was pretty early and jumped on in the kind of early 90s this time really started hammering infomercials on tv that was his main channel like today facebook ads is i think the infomercials of today but he was really the master of infomercials back then and so he's like all right i'm gonna do i'm gonna create this company and originally he wanted to call it i think like um he so he's like i want to start this company he goes to his friends and family he raises 500 dollars from angel uh angel investor friends and family he says all right i'm gonna test five products and i'm gonna see what sticks and they're gonna be in this like fitness space and the whole idea was like i have this distribution channel infomercials and i'm gonna create products that are sticky that people that help people lose weight essentially get more fit and so he starts with the very first one i think was tony he goes to tony horton tony horton at the time is a celebrity trainer so he's training bruce springsteen and like all these kind of like musicians and actors and actresses in hollywood so he goes to tony and he says let's create a product called great body guaranteed and he's like oh i love it great body guaranteed how can it miss and he goes to he tries to get greatbody.com and it's taken and so he's like doing his thing he's walking around on the beach in l.a walking home one day and he's like he's on the beach he just thinks beachbody beachbody.com he runs home checks out checks beachbody.com is available so he grabs it and so he starts trying to produce these infomercials with tony for this program and they've produced many many programs um and and he realized at the time okay like i can't afford celebrity endorsements right like that's why tony had a good name was because he was training for celebrities but he couldn't really afford celebrity endorsements so they start just trying to do like um like kind of like uh infomercials without that so customer testimonials so he comes up with this idea that the customer is the celebrity how do i make the customer a celebrity anyway so what he the initial batch of infomercial title actually failed where he was just saying you know get a great body and it's just super jacked people on screen saying how jacked they are basically and so instead you know it's kind of just money down the drain during that part and instead they try one version of the infomercial where they took a few testimonials that had been sent in from their buyers that said hey look at you know this was me before and this is me now and me now wasn't like didn't look like a greek god but just like definitely looked better than the out of shape overweight person you know in the before photo so they slap those into the infomercial like real customer testimonials and boom this thing starts selling like hotcakes and so he realizes oh wait the more authentic these look and so he started curating he goes i want the customer testimonials to almost look like america's funniest home video footage like somebody at home their cats jumping on them while they're doing a sit-up their plant is you know dying in the background they can barely hold their balance while doing the pose and then you see the after photo 90 days later that they look great and that was his kind of core insight that was working really really well and he was very differentiated because everybody else was who was doing at home was really at this time was doing like some gimmick product like thigh master ab roller bowflex like selling some equipment this equipment will solve your problems and it said he was like no no i'm gonna make a promise you do my program for 90 days you get this result and that promise marketing was much better and that's what 75 heart is too it's another variant of this promise marketing well there's a tight difference i think so if i i don't know i don't think it's like this anymore but when 75 hard first started it was around as a free movement so basically this guy would say like all right everyone it's that time of year we're doing it and he would it's like no shave november yeah i forget the months but i've i've seen i've seen it for a couple years now and he would basically i guess instagram like now's the time for the challenge and i think he did it for like maybe four years before it even became a thing so p90x i think it's a you enroll and you have 90 days to get it done this 75 hard thing was a you know november first get ready like you know time to get rid of seasonal things yeah and it worked really well i guess is 75 hard now like a rolling 75 i i think it's i i think so because they have this app so i don't think it's just one time of the year but um and if it's number three right now and we're in june or we're in april so i think you know it's it's definitely not the november thing as it was before and so just to go back to beachbody so beachbody the company does over a billion dollars a year in revenue just to break down their business they basically so he he comes up with this concept of that of uh gym at home instead of a home gym so it's like how do you do the gym workout at home and uh he's like okay we have we're gonna use infomercials and we're going to use dvds dvds are going to be great because you're going to be able to put it on your tv and you do it whenever you want sort of on demand great and so you start selling dvds and the dvds do well and programs like p90x are part of it and for p90x it was actually a little bit of a pivot for them there's actually these cool videos on youtube of them in their meetings and he's pitching this he's like okay look right now we're all about losing weight it's all weight loss it's all um uh like kind of like belly fat that's the market we go after for beachbody but for p90x i want to do something different he's like we need like an extreme program for the muscle builder he's like i noticed there's all these magazines like men's fitness and muscle muscle monthly and all this stuff where people are really trying to like build huge muscles and so let's set out the tenants for this thing and he's like doing a presentation he's like this is not for beginners this is at home this is meant to build muscles get shredded you're going to get shredded in 90 days he's like that's the promise we're going to make to the people and so he you know i like seeing these meetings where people are like coming up with the the concept that they know you know takes over the nation type of thing and so their model is you have the dvds and then he's like okay cool distribution through infomercials was good but we've kind of hit our limit there so then he took a page out of the amway mlm playbook he's like here's what we'll do we'll get our our most successful customers will become our coaches we'll teach them how to sell this program for themselves how to be their own mini tony horton so they go and they build this nationwide network of 400 000 coaches and then of course the coaches can train other coaches and they can keep a share of their revenue right classic mlm multi-level marketing some people call it a pyramid scheme or a ponzi scheme but there's a there's a legal way to do this and he's doing it the legal way and so the top coaches i think in his case it's an i'm reading all about him it's an mln but it's not i don't find this to be unethical or bad i mean it's just he's he's making customer sales people for him so i was once talking to a friend and he was like dude we need to create this product and we'll do it we'll sell it as mlm i was like dude mlm isn't that like you know isn't that like a sin he's like why he's like it's basically you get your your hardcore believers do i know this arm them with the ability to sell it you know the friend yeah i think i i think i know and i think they love mlms because an mlm almost bought them um yeah and mlms inherently are not wrong now exactly the way he described it he goes look there's a knob think about this way this is a model just like affiliate marketing or any kind of viral marketing um you basically give people products and let them sell it um it's like there's a knob though the knob is like kind of like your evil knob and you could turn it down to zero and when you're at zero you're basically saying hey if you're a fan of our product you can become one of our coaches and um you can there's no minimums you don't have to subscribe to this monthly thing you don't have to like uh you know do this the wrong way is like or you turn it up to 12 and you go super evil and you basically say hey dude you could become a millionaire if you become one of our coaches look at this guy he's a millionaire don't you want to be a millionaire and then you basically get them to sign up for this thing where they have to pay you 100 a month they have to buy ten thousand dollars of product and now they're they're their kids bedroom is full of like this this you know hair loss uh you know shampoo treatment that they need to sell and then they can't sell but they bought ten thousand dollars worth and you made your money anyways and then they go broke because they try to become one of your reps and like you you that knob is like in your control to turn how screwed up you want to be with it and so anyways i think beachbody is like somewhere in the not so evil category from what i know uh their top tr their cup coaches and trainers make about like two to three million dollars a year um and a lot of that revenue again comes from the coaches that they brought on board um they get a percentage of their sales and the company by the way beachbody i'm reading all about um their ceo and he's giving an interview and he says they do this year and 20 they'll do a billion in sales and they do about 10 percent ebitda so a hundred million in net profit uh on a billion in sales yeah i'm surprised it's not better the way that they describe their mod of ads the way they describe their model is like they have the dvds which now has become streaming they have the coaches to go like distribute those like that's their sales their sales force and they make all their profit on the shakes so the whole thing comes down to this like shake product they have called shakeology and basically it's like okay the the streaming or the dvds the content that's good but it's not like it costs so much to market it it's not that good um okay you know the coaches well you got to recruit them you got to train them they got to sell they're good but they're not that good the shakes it's like 130 dollars for your one month of nutrition shakes um and that's like pure margin it goes back to that andy facility guys like supplement company it's like they make all their money the profits come from the shakes and the whole thing with the coaches is like cool we get you hooked on this program and then you want better results feel better results you got to trim up that diet hey here's what i do i drink these delicious shakes they're so tasty and they are i did not know that yeah so that's that's their model so i think beachbody is a pretty fascinating company i think that these i think that marketing your product as a x days promise is a very smart idea because you're basically saying you're going to get this result in this much time whether that's eight minute abs or p90x or 75 hard or it's that diet whole 30 where you're gonna do 30 days of eating whole foods only like i've seen this work so many times i'm very fascinated by it i don't know why it works in the psychology of the of the customer but it definitely does work and then the last piece is i think one of the reasons it works is because customers can sort of commit to like well i can do this for x days that doesn't sound too hard 90 days i could do anything for 90 days 30 day diet okay like maybe i'm not going to change my diet and become a vegan but can i eat whole foods for 30 days all right that's a challenge and i thought it was very interesting the way he talked about this which was there's two ways to market it because we've always marketed our products as you can do it like this is so easy you can do it and what 75 heart of p90x do is the opposite they go can you do it it's a challenge to you like i don't know if you can do it this is it's hard right so then they started creating all these pro they have two versions of their marketing you can do it marketing and can you do it marketing and i love that i thought that was such an interesting way of like thinking about your business they have a program called insanity why is it called insanity because it's meant to sound super [ __ ] hard and too crazy and like why is p90x it's the extreme home workout it's not that easy beginner sit-ups and push-up stuff this is the extreme so i thought that was pretty cool okay so what we're going to launch in this space so i've been working with my trainer now and i'm actually like i've hit some tipping point where i'm starting to get results like i look at my body like during the during our sessions and like we work out in my garage there's this one area where the sun like comes into my garage and the shadow is just perfect and i look [ __ ] great and i'm like dude this i need to stay in here like can we do my center it works with exercising it's like no results no results no results boom it all kind of ha it feels like it happens dude that's how everything valuable was like slowly slowly slowly then suddenly um and so it's like all business success works that way and i'm now saying even fitness success works that way where there is a tipping point and where now the workouts i don't dread them i enjoy them i'm looking forward to them i feel bad if i ever get miss a day whereas before i was like sweet snow day don't have to work out you know like i was looking forward to missing it now now i'm looking forward to doing it so anyways i was talking to my trainer and i was like dude i'm gonna help you i'm gonna help you create because he's always hearing me talk about business and it's like he's a black belt in fitness i like to consider myself like really good at uh business and we're trying to help each other out and so i told him i was like dude why don't you do this like why don't you create like he's a gem to me he's not like a normal trainer he's like i've told many stories about how he helps my mindset and all this stuff and he's really talking too i'm like dude you're cut above like most people i was like we should create one of these where it's like i was like just with my friends like just the people i know in my my my life who if i post a photo of me today and i post a photo of me like a few months ago before i started working out with you like i'm gonna post that before and after photo that's my own pride moment of like i did it i actually turned the corner of this thing that's been forever a really hard thing for me i've never really considered myself fit or shredded or like been proud to take off my shirt but i think i'm going to get there pretty soon like within a few months i think i'm going to get there i was like when i post that after photo i was like we should open up something that says if you want to do it like let's create our own 90-day program and like let people in because i was like the way i was thinking about it was he has this philosophy which is like um we talked about like um how do you feel when your friends get successful and um and i told him honestly i was like yeah like it's been hard for me like when my friend when sam sells this company pretended all of a sudden sam's got tens of millions of dollars that's like i'm happy for you yes i'm not like not happy for you but there's a bigger part of me in that moment right when the news hits that's like oh [ __ ] i'm behind right you know i was like the honest truth was like i get kind of jealous or like i'm getting kind of envious and so he helped me sort of reframe that in my mind this is not about you but like it's been this way for decades you know like i always felt this way if somebody's successful like good for them but bad for me and he's like you know it doesn't have to be that way good for them bad for me it can be good for them it's good for me he's like it's just this philosophy you got to have where do you carry yourself where you say it's not just that i'm going to win i'm going to help bring up all the people around me we're all going to win and it's going to be more fun that we're all going to win he's like you do this with investing right you share your deals and you co-invest and you let your you want your friends to invest in your companies because when you win it's more fun to toast together and drink together he's like same thing with like all aspects of life you should be thinking about i'm not just gonna win i'm gonna win so much there's gonna be so much like success around me that all the people around me are gonna be successful too anyways long story short of i heard him tell me about that and i i took it to him i go i'm gonna help you build a business that does this i'm gonna take the thing you're really good at that you're doing for me and now i have him working with my sister my mom my sister's kids uh my sister-in-law i paid you know like we do all of their fitness now through him he's like my family's personal coach really and so i'm like yeah he's doing that's i'm we're his only clients anymore it's just like my own family what uh can you like tell me what you pay this person uh no i don't want to put him on blast like that you want to talk about his name you want to say his name or do you want to even hide him yeah i mean i call him j.a that's his name is john alexander so he goes short for j.a and he's not being on social media or nothing like that like he doesn't try to be like some influencer guy or whatever a trainer yeah he's a trainer that's what he's been doing he's been you know fit his whole life and you know he's really good at that a shaved head white guy no i don't know i'll send you his instagram later um but basically i want to i want to help him be successful i think we can use one of these like i think we can use this model of this p90x or 75 hard let people commit to something that's reasonable for them that's the way i did it with him i was like all right i'm gonna i'm gonna commit i don't know how good you are how bad i am i don't know if i can do this long term but like i'll comment i'll give you 30 days to get my ass off this couch like i'm just i'm sick of this get my ass going 30 days i will do anything you [ __ ] say one hour a day i will sweat my ass off and like that got me hooked and so i think we're going to come up with some program like that this is we're like months away from actually launching something but i want to do that because i think a i want to share him with more people and b i just think this is a cool business model why do you do everything you do why like why do you not focus more on one or two things and i criticize you i don't criticize you i i i challenge you often why continually why do this do that do that do this why not just do one thing and crush it because and your your answer i might be well because i just want to explore to see everything out there but it's pretty obvious what you're good at which is what i have a feeling that your rolling fund is going to be wildly successful uh i have a feeling that like you pull a lot of the weight in the podcast because you're you're very good at content why do everything instead of just be the best at this you're this in this little lane i do think about that um i think i've graduated out of being an operator i no longer want to operate one entity the only nc i want to operate is uh you know seanco my life and when i think about like what would be the most exciting version of that how do i how do i marry this part of me that's just super curious and every day you know i want to go down the rabbit hole and learn how 75 hard works and not you know p90x works right before this podcast i would do that anyways i just didn't have an excuse i didn't have an outlet i would just do the research shove it in my head and then i would go about my job in my life and i would keep running my company which had nothing to do with fitness right this podcast was a cool thing because it gave me an excuse to do more of that thing i'm interested in i do good at and now it's a win-win now i go down those rabbit holes i learn those things i come here i share the learnings and cool we we get which uh we're both doing which is and then you like oh i think this is actually a really good idea let's go put money again and then i see the company and then i basically say cool now i'm going to invest my money i'm going to share my knowledge to an operator who can go start that business and so my training this will be my trainer's business it's not gonna be my business but i will plant the seed with them that hey this would be great and i'll do everything in my power to help you be successful meaning i'll give you seed funding i'll be your test customer testimonial like that's that's on me to get get make my after picture better than my before picture and then lastly like i'll [ __ ] i'll spread the love i'll spread the word about about your thing when the time comes whenever you're ready like i wasn't planning on talking about it today it's just coinciding with let's talk about beachbody so anyways i would say like that to me is a more fun life i basically decided all right i want my life to be where i wake up and whatever i'm most curious about i go do because i have a way to monetize my own curiosity i have a way to monetize my own learnings okay so how do i that's what i've decided is my thing for the next decade i'm going to push a little bit because i actually think that that your premise might be a little flawed here which is i'm going to wake up and i'm going to do what i want i'm going to no no i'm going to go learn about what i'm most interested in what i'm most curious about and i would actually actually i would challenge that a little bit because it's like well you're kind of implying that you're each day you're going to do a new thing and i don't necessarily like like for crypto like i've spent months in crypto right because you know years of curiosity but then like months of pretty hardcore curiosity around that i think that's good and it's become like a bigger part of my portfolio of time and money and so say you know same thing with e-commerce i got more interested in e-commerce right same thing with live streaming for many years it was all about live streaming so these don't have to be every day it's a new topic i think that would be a bit extreme but um but with the podcast yeah you know we do two of these a week we talk about three different topics each time we're by no means experts at any of those it's like very kind of like off the cuff type of conversation and research but i think it's like the way i think about it is like tim ferriss has done this if i've seen anybody do it i think that tim ferriss has done this where he's uh he's very curious about certain things that he wants to go learn so then he goes talks to people in that space he does experiments on himself he reads books about that topic he reads research papers about the topic and then he packages it up into something that's sellable sometimes and sometimes it's not sellable and it's just for him it's just for his own curiosity i think i could do that i think i can create the new new business model of being tim ferriss so that would be if what's my one thing i think it's that but to the outside it looks like a lot of variety and to me that's good it's but it's well i'm not trying to criticize it here i'm just trying to bring in a different perspective um because i was thinking about i i saw i know this guy who's like getting something off the ground and i see him constantly talking about like side projects day trading um um bitcoin yadda yadda yadda and this business is really related to something totally separate i'm like what are you doing dude just like right lock yourself in the room don't do anything except for like be with your family exercise and like work on your thing um right because like it seems almost not not impossible some are really good at it but for most it seems almost impossible to create anything meaningful without a maniacal amount of focus at least early on for an extended period of time more likely than not though um i think that's true i think that's true and it's it would be definitely true if i said oh i'm gonna go start a company i'm gonna raise much money and this is gonna be uh i'm gonna make this huge company i'm not doing that that's not my thing right now so like if when i was doing that i didn't have a podcast i didn't have a fund i didn't have a blog i didn't have i didn't have a girlfriend i didn't have many things i sacrificed on many of those because i was all in sleeping at the office 200 days here i just know that that's not what this next phase looks like for me i could do that again i don't really want to and so i'm trying to see is there a better model for me that that is more of that feels effortless to me that always felt like a lot of effort and i think that there is a version of life that it doesn't have to be so hard uh i think it can be speedy and easy i think it can be effortless if you're doing the thing you really enjoy doing i agree with that on a day-to-day basis i wouldn't use the word effortless but it's uh it's it's uh rewarding like when you play do you feel like you're working hard no like i can go play basketball i could be really tired by the end of it so i mean fatigue because i've played basketball for three hours but at no point in it would i feel like i'm having to like do something i don't want to be doing oh my god i mean if you want to use that play thing like i don't always i love to exercise but i don't always want to go do it but i'm always happy that i did do it uh and like uh i don't want to because to me working out is not like play play is a really specific word uh play is like you know i could be tired from my job i'll come home i can play video games and video games take actually like you know focus hand-eye coordination strategy talking to your teammates all that stuff but because it's fun it doesn't feel like work to me right and so i'm interested in in play now i'm not interested in hard work so um where do we go from here uh i think we might wrap it as there's been a little we went on kind of tangents there i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on a roll let's travel never looking back

i used to chase money a lot like how do i make money maybe this will make us money maybe this will make some money and that was good because i like learned skills about how to make money but the things that actually paid off none of those really paid off with a big dollar amount yeah i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back all right before we actually get into the content um a few things we've been making a ton of changes to this podcast the numbers are working i think the last month was our highest ever right abreu i believe so yeah so i think we should start saying the numbers i think we should start saying the numbers i think we should say what it is say what we're gonna do and say what happens whether it works or it doesn't yeah so the trailing of 30 days was i think 350 000 listens um which if it's not the highest ever it's one of like one or two but the trajectory is is really what matters and that is great so we're getting around an average episode i think is twenty thousand downloads an episode which is i think a sixty percent increase from the year before is that right abreu am i am i getting all these yes twenty two to 23 000. right so let's say we're at 22 000 uh it used to be 15 of course it used to be zero so you know whatever it's growing and our goal is a hundred thousand per episode one rose bowl stadium per episode is what i want to be doing something like that and uh so we're not far 4x is you know it's not far i think naturally that would happen in a couple years and what we're going to do is just accelerate it so it happens in one yeah i feel quite confident that if we do the same thing but more it would happen with time but i don't want to do that i'm impatient i want it to happen immediately so uh the changes we've made is we've prepared more for every podcast which i think is very clearly working yes we now have these videos going um which i also think is clearly working and that it makes me feel good is it driving downloads i don't actually i'm not convinced but it's worth it you know what it does do is there's a whole group of people that like either a just don't listen to podcasts or don't listen much so they're like kind of like otherwise they would only hop in once in a while they didn't build a habit with us and they follow just through the clip so there's actually just like another audience that's like oh good i watch those clips every time because they're good and i always get messages i am yeah and i'm in that category as well i've never i don't think i've ever listened to a joe rogan podcast but i watch a lot of clips right um and uh we're putting our clips on youtube which is not working that is not working well at all for us right um maybe the we're putting the full episodes on and a handful have 20 to 30 000 views maybe even more a couple of them have a few more that's working but the clips are not working and then we're doing email blasts and the hustle i think that started two weeks ago that is working we should we should rewind we should basically say we had a meeting which was like a few i don't know week ago maybe something like that and i was like oh okay we got all these ideas basically i threw in a few ideas you had a few ideas bray who had a few ideas my buddy ben had a few ideas we were like oh yeah great all these sound good so like who's gonna do them and then we kind of had this like come to jesus moment where it was like look in sam we trust like if and we can't we can't outsource this to somebody else who doesn't really i don't want to say it doesn't care but like it's a different thing when it's your baby it's your show you are getting the like the more people who listen to this the cooler opportunities we get the better dms we get every morning and so like clearly it matters more to us than it would be for even if it was somebody's full-time job and uh the second thing is like your skill level is super high right like we saw you grow the hustle i saw you grow the hustle a lot of people who were subscribers saw you grow the hustle saw you go trends from scratch and saw you sell the thing and it's like so i got excited because i was like i'm gonna get to see sam in action even closer than i did with the hustle where like you would send a monthly update now i'm seeing how you actually operate and it's pretty dope and i actually think the listeners will like to see how you operate how you approach growing a thing and uh that i think that'll be exciting that's a lot of pressure thank you for the compliment that's a lot of pressure i i will say i think growing the podcast has been i mean that's actually one of the harder things i've done yeah but uh hubspot owns us now it's not my money like it's their money and and so we're in a totally i mean we're our owner you know the company this company now does a billion a year in revenue there's like a billion plus in cash in the bank account like so we can actually so we're gonna have a lot more resources i actually am not convinced that that's actually gonna help us grow that yeah i don't think resources helps you grow but i think i i would say like that wasn't the problem before uh it could be helpful but that wasn't necessarily the problem and then so what we're doing now is uh we don't have ads in the email anymore so in the hustle we do zero advertisements and the podcast is going in every day now um or not every day but a lot and then also what we are launching at hubspot and the hustle is we're creating this thing well i actually don't know if i could say too much about it but there's going to be a lot more podcasts and amongst those podcasts we can promote one another and that's what you're going to hear so whoever is in our pot our podcast crew we're going to promote them them us yadda yadda and i actually think that's going to help a ton i think that um i actually don't think i could talk any and it's pretty dope who's in that but we'll say it later when you can so okay can i give the audience the five ideas that we had brainstormed that were like oh okay once thing one was like let's put sam in charge of it because sam knows how to grow [ __ ] that was step one step two okay so what are the like how would you grow a podcast if you're gonna grow a podcast so we said i'm gonna rattle off the ideas number one big name guests that actually have an overlapping audience so people like chamath people like tim ferriss uh not just like a famous person who like for example we had jake paul on uh super famous but his audience is in our audience not gonna have a huge amount of overlap where it's not necessarily that his fans would would connect with us and become you know ongoing subscribers um okay the other one was paid can you advertise to grow a podcast right like running some experiments on take a few thousand bucks run it on a paid campaign and see can you grow through through paid i think we'll find out that's interesting we're doing so we bought ads in uh player fm abreu is that what we did yep yep and then um we're buying ads and a few more i have a few more that we're buying ads did that work uh i bring you player fm it's hard to tell because they claim a lot of their views come from desktop listeners um which doesn't necessarily get measured according to them um oh that's like saying like thank you yeah yeah it's like like no look the it's like this is like selling like cbd treats for dogs like does it work right can't ask your dog yeah it was like the greatest business ever it's like selling vitamin b for your puppy uh yeah exactly so i would say if it's hard to tell it didn't work it's a very obvious way to think about it um okay another one go on other people's podcasts so do a do a tour going on other people's pods they already have an audience those people listen they say oh man what a great guy i'd love to listen to more of this person they were interesting boom get some people from there clips uh people have seen we tripled down on clips we found awesome clip makers we're making [ __ ] up eclipse and we're gonna post the [ __ ] out of them so i think that's a good good strategy um there's the and then the last one that i thought was kind of an interesting one was like get sharper on the branding so if you want to grow a product the sharper the hook of what is the product uh the better chance you have to grow because it'll be more clear it'll resonate with more people and so being able to describe it well as well as just being like on brand all the time about like what this is and what you get out of it if you listen to it i think that's an area that honestly kind of shitty at which is ironic because i think we're pretty good at it with our startups but we're pretty bad at it with the podcast like the name doesn't really make much sense um the description i don't know we don't have like we don't do an intro when you join to like be like oh this is the podcast where xyz happens we don't have like a a highlight reel of like you know start here if you're if you're new to the pod like go here this is the onboarding episode you know basically in a sense it kind of succeeds a little bit in spite of itself right um and and a lot of people say the name doesn't really matter or sorry the name doesn't reflect it and i'm in my opinion towards just names is it doesn't your name really like it rarely will it hurt you in some occasions it actually could help you i think coinbase is like the perfect name ever right but uh even if coinbase was called like uh uh blue sky uh sunglasses i'm just looking i'm just making [ __ ] up that i'm looking at um it would work blue sky uh like it won't work it would have worked uh okay so uh should we move on to coinbase actually let's move on to coinbase so coinbase went public today and it's everything about it is astounding right um do you want to start i can read off some of the kind of the numbers of like just how big is that business and then we can talk about the returns of this inves of the investment so how big is the business so coinbase came out the public now so now they released their numbers their q1 numbers came out 56 million users um six million monthly active users which is i think more than e-trade had uh you know like total i think e-trade had like three million uh like trade trader accounts or whatever and so this is kind of amazing to me that there was more people on coinbase um coinbase makes up 11 of the crypto asset market in terms of how many assets are stored on crypto crypt uh on coinbase 335 billion in trading volume okay here's the interesting bits uh 1.8 billion in revenue for the quarter um for the quarter for the quarter so round up to two so about eight billion ish in revenue that's right annualized um 800 in net income off that off that 1.8 billion in revenue so like 2.4 billion dollars annualize in profit right and uh and then yeah so basically the coinbase goes it lists publicly today it wasn't a it wasn't an ipo as a direct listing where you basically you know ipo is you create some shares uh you issue new shares to buyers direct listing is you don't issue new shares it's just people who have shares can get you know like basically sell some of their shares so uh they listed they had about 114 million shares for sale and uh it's up about 40 on day one so the implied market cap as of right now is about 110 billion so what i wanted to know was um there's this kind of uh phrase in the startup investing world which is like anytime there's a gold rush like some new frontier new space it can be hard to like pick the winner it can be hard to like you know just grab your shovel dig and find the gold and there's a thousand people looking for gold you don't know where to dig it might be this one might be that lot that land you you know you don't know exactly where the gold is so the foolproof strategy in any gold rush is what they call the pixel shovel strategy meaning you you sell the shovels to people who are going gonna go mine to gold and so coinbase is kind of a classic picks and shovels thing in the crypto market so you you could buy bitcoin you could buy ethereum you could buy one you could buy litecoin or dogecoin or one of the thousand altcoins that exist and you're betting okay maybe one of these will become like the digital currency um or you could buy a coinbase in exchange that's going to trade a bulk you know a bulk number of these coins and so i wanted to know once coinbase got up to where it was like 100 billion valuation i had the question of what would have been a better investment coinbase at its seed round or bitcoin that same day if you could should you have bought the currency or should you have invested in the company and the reason i thought this was interesting is i remember 2013 i was i just kind of heard about crypto from a guy in my office like our pete our rit guy was like dude bitcoin is the [ __ ] it's at seven dollars now it's at 11 i was like i don't know what that means and he was like yeah [ __ ] fiat currency and i was like fiat i think that was a car i didn't even know that's a currency at the time i didn't know what that meant um and he was like mining bitcoin using our servers at the office and he's like we mined two bitcoin today and i was like okay good for you pete like what does that do you know i was kind of like you know mocking it but i was curious also so i started going to listening to some talks and uh and so one of the things i was looking at was like are are smart vcs are people smarter than me investing in this space and what i remember happening was i listened to this talk and it was andreessen horowitz was mark andreessen uh who now blocks me on twitter um he was talking at a thing he's talking about how crypto's gonna be great how it's how bitcoin is gonna you know is such a interesting technology how uh blockchains might change everything and then the interviewer was like so how many investments how much money have you put into this you're kind of hyping it up like how much money have you invested and like we haven't invested in any crypto companies yet uh this is like i think 2012 20 i think it's 2012 and he goes right now we're just owning the currency we're just buying bitcoin and i was like what that's so weird these guys like they're they're a vc fund they bet on companies there's a few companies out there like i found it to be super strange because right now the bet we don't know which of these companies is going to emerge as the winner so we're just buying the underlying tech the underlying currency we actually think that's the right move right now and uh and later you know andrews norwood has actually did invest in coinbase later and uh since invested many projects and actually andreas horowitz changed their whole fund structure from a private you know vc fund to like some other kind of like financial investment vehicle they went and got registered with like the sec or whatever because they wanted to own crypto assets and you couldn't do that out of a traditional fund they couldn't you couldn't buy currencies out of a traditional fund the paperwork the docs don't let you and so um so anyways i went back and looked at the numbers so coinbase announces seed round september 2012. um i don't know they probably raised it a little bit before that and then they announced it they raised 600 000 from investors including a crowdfunding campaign which i which i found interesting because i don't like them i [ __ ] on crowdfunding all the time as like me too it's always the bottom of the barrel but this was through funders club funders club had put in like 285 thousand dollars through its crowdfunding into that and so anyway what is is fun and funders club is just a startup like underscore itself is a yc startup and then coinbase was a yc startup and so funders club took a took a share uh like did it did a crowdfunding campaign for for that uh if i read this correctly i i could be wrong in this part but anyways i went and asked one of the seed investors so somebody who uh a friend uh who invested in the seed round of coinbase i said what was the valuation back then he said it was 15 cents a share so 15 cents a share there and he said the a round was only 20 cents a share so it wasn't even that much more um something like that so so 15 cents a share and um now it's trading right now like right before this podcast at 330 a share or whatever and so you got this uh you know 2000 x markup i think 2200 x markup and um so you invested a hundred thousand dollars in the in the seed round of coinbase that's worth 220 million dollars on this day today because it goes it goes public now if you would invest in bitcoin same time bitcoin at in that same month was trading at twelve dollars a coin now it's at sixty two thousand dollars a coin so your same hundred k instead you know would have been worth five hundred million dollars so still bitcoin was the better investment even though this was like a you know you invest in a startup that's became a 110 billion dollar company still bitcoin outperformed but uh it's closer than i would have thought because coinbase has really gone up in value in the last two years so let's give some more numbers um i think right before we started the valuation was 80 billion but a few hours ago it was a hundred billion right we're gonna use a hundred billion because that math is a little easier um brian armstrong is the ceo he's 38 years old he owns i think twenty percent of the company uh which means uh a hundred billion his net worth is 20 billion dollars which puts him i think like in the top 50 richest people in the world at 38. uh the company coinbase i let's see it started when 12 so it's uh nine years old uh so basically became the from zero to richest uh top fifty richest people in the world in only uh ten ish years nine years and also he owns twenty percent of coinbase who knows how much i don't know i certainly don't know but you have to ask how much bitcoin does this does this person own if you told me that it was another 20 billion i don't think i would be surprised at all do you would you be surprised 20 billion is a lot that is that is a that is a very very large amount so i don't think it would be quite so high but i wouldn't be surprised if if it was over a billion dollars i think 20 billion would be 20 billion would be like he'd be one of the the top three i think bitcoin whales i think at 20 billion or something like that yeah okay okay so i think that'd be way too much would you think i i i i don't i didn't do the math ahead of time but would you think you would be a top 50 bitcoin holder that seems reasonable right it's plausible yeah so i don't know we you know he i don't think he's ever said or disclosed you know if he if he was buying the underlying coins though so the biggest thing is did you hold right because bitcoin on this run up right so from when you know if if he's doing coinbase bitcoin's at ten dollars a coin right that becomes your kind of like frame of reference bitcoin today is trading at 63 000 63 000 from 12 is such a like mind-boggling like change and so when i was talking to the my friend who was an investor in coinbase i said i was like wow did that did that mean does that mean that coinbase outperformed bitcoin he goes no i think bitcoin still wins he goes but name one person who held all their bitcoin from 2012 to 2021. he's like sam's racing well i guess like of people who owned a lot of it at that time no i didn't i didn't own a lot i owned i bought hundreds of dollars worth but no not a lot so let's say you owned a lot you know as that nest egg becomes 10 million 20 million 100 million dollars you're gonna like a lot of people would would liquidate some of it and so he was saying you know all of us at coinbase we really couldn't sell this whole way and he goes the illiquidity was a feature not a bug like the fact that we couldn't sell this whole time for coinbase it was the best money making strategy for us to like not be able to be liquid until now i didn't sell but my numbers were like tens of thousands or maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars right it certainly was not a million or tens of millions but uh i i didn't sell because i actually forgot my password and i was like uh i just don't want to log in because it's too hard and so i didn't log in have you stopped you have it now or no yeah i have it now like i had i had uh i just never did like a forgot your password thing in my email because i was like too much work maybe it's a sign i'm just not going to sell right um and so i didn't sell but can what do you have in front of you are you looking at something i'm looking at this tweet you put in of chances i want to bring i want to bring this up yeah so um the numbers here is fascinating but i actually don't think that's the really fascinating part what's the fascinating part is the psychology behind this because today's coinbase in 20 years it's going to be something else uh 50 years ago it was real estate or something 100 years ago it was oil there's always something yeah and the psychology behind the human being i think is far more interesting and by the way he was an engineer at airbnb before he left to go start coinbase his airbnb shares from you know would have done amazingly as well right like while he only worked at airbnb i think for a year and before that he worked at deloitte so i'm almost positive granted he was probably a genius probably like you know crazy high iq but like normal guy uh normal like a normal nine to five um and also uh so let's talk about the let's talk about the personality part here that i love um i like knowing what drives people what makes them tick we talk about billionaire of the week and it's not actually about necessarily the money but what what what what do people think who achieve greatness right in this case it's money but reality greatness can be a variety of things um so daniel gross is the guy we have in this podcast he went uh so hacker news if you guys don't know what hacker news is you should read it every single day it's basically uh reddit but only for nerds i love it i read it every day it's uh tech folks um and anyway um brian armstrong has a handle on tech news or on hacker news and you could read his old posts and he has this ol and daniel gross uh tweeted out some of this guy's old post his handle uh is uh i actually don't know what his handle is but well it's sorry it's b armstrong and so b armstrong actually had a blog listen to his blog and this is actually kind of funny it's called start breaking free.com which is which is kind of on right on brand consistently and actually if you go to startbrakingfree.com it's controlled by a virus so it like they it automatically wants you to install a it's controlled by a virus or you know what i mean like are you like it's like if i go to right now it's gonna try to install like you know security software that actually he's gonna steal all my money yeah just do it yeah well it's gonna say like you won you know you're the lucky winner uh like somehow he let the domain expire or something like that and uh someone got a hold of it so now it's just a scam which is kind of funny uh that the guy who's supposed to be like mr security his web his domain expired and uh yeah whatever but anyway you can see his post history and he was launching a lot of stuff he launched this one thing and it says hey hacker news i just built a new forum software hey hacker news i just built a new photo sharing website so the guy was really prolific and it's really interesting to see his posts yeah he was definitely like trying uh like what daniel tweeted out was i you know i look back at brian's hacker new submissions before he started coinbase you can see what you see is a story of a hacker working on different projects slowly zeroing in on his launch coordinates uh right because he's consistently shipping stuff they're not all like you know some of them have like one up vote seven up votes 32 comments right like they're not like taking off so you see a guy taking a bunch of swings and as his swings you could see it was you know like something about maps something about could you know how would you start your own country something about like could you build an entire web app in one language and then it's like bitcoin android release um you know like how airbnb does x and then it's about you know like how to build your own forum uh bitcoin iphone app and you know just like sort of finding finding like the thing that is his thing and this is this is the true for everybody right like you know people joke about sam's uh you know sam's foot long wieners or whatever your hot dog stand yeah you know my sushi restaurant it's like if you dig back into people's first projects um you're always gonna find interesting things like mark zuckerberg first project that uh i've heard him talk about have you heard this the dentist office thing no he set up an internal like just net internet network for his dad's dental office so it's like a messaging like the secretary of the front desk could message him and his office uh you know in the back so he just like kind of set up the internet inside their office and let them message each other then he built wire hog you know oh and wirehog i think was really successful by the way well for like a 17 year old kid for yeah exactly 417 it was more successful and there's chat transcripts of when he after he like leaves to go work on facebook he moves you know in the social network they moved to palo alto it's like this is it facebook's gonna be the thing there's chat transcripts of him talking at that time like yeah like i think wirehog's the thing um you know like so even then it's not obvious at that time and whereas people try to project that these guys are visionaries they are you know visionary geniuses who never had a doubt in their mind and then they saw the future and then they built it and it's like well well i actually think that a couple of those things are true they could be visionary geniuses or rather they could be geniuses but that's actually not a prerequisite but it does help but they definitely had doubt regardless of how confident someone is it doesn't matter if you're conor mcgregor and you're going in a fight you always have doubt no matter what um and second um they probably didn't have a vision until it started getting a little bit of traction right um i go back through there's these there's this uh interview on youtube of mark uh doing there's like some college news station that's interviewing him some guy some some guy has like a college podcast and he invites mark zuckerberg on because he's got the college social network that's kind of like taking off on a handful of colleges i think they're on like i don't know five or ten campuses at the time and he's like you know so what what is this going to be you're going to go out to more colleges and then what like high schools and then you know non-college students and mark's like we're sitting there in his like basketball shorts um with a red solo cup in his hand and he's like i don't know like i don't know if it has to do that like why can't this just be like the cool thing for colleges like once you take it out of the college thing then you let everybody in it's like less cool like maybe this is just cool and like now he's literally putting [ __ ] satellites into the sky to give people in india the internet so that they can use facebook like yeah so the aspirations changed the takeaway here and i actually just went back to my high school the other day to like give like a talk and i was like dude doesn't it you guys look small when you walk into high school yeah and you meet a 16 year old and you're like oh my gosh like i felt i was mature i felt i knew what i was doing you're a child yeah i could beat you up yeah i'm like i was like dude i'm 30 and i thought that we were more similar but we're not we're not at all yeah yeah we're not like why are these children low to the ground yeah everything is so small and like water fountains are disgusting i can't believe i used to drink from them anyway um i was like you guys just do [ __ ] take swings tinker on stuff first of all a lot of stuff that starts out cool it actually looked really dumb early on but even if it stays dumb just get into the habit of taking swings and making stuff because uh like i'm not like uber successful but my first [ __ ] was like a poison ivy business it was my first stuff was like stupid and like it led to this thing and this thing and like hopefully the thing that i'm doing now is actually going to lead to something even bigger and i also did a ton of research and i found out that there is this poison ivy treatment called zanful z-a-n-f i think zandful and basically i did a ton of research and i found the guy who started it used to work at a cleaning supplies company and i was like oh that's interesting what is going on here like that's kind of weird that i just saw that connection and i did research and i found out that basically what he did was he took this thing called i think it was called mean green and it was really good at washing um oil off mechanics hands and it costs like five dollars for a gallon it was dirt cheap but he found out that uh the way poison ivy works is if if leave gets on you or if it leave it's on you it gets this oil on you and you have to use this oil stuff uh this oil remover yeah yeah same thing with poison oak or whatever yeah yeah same thing and i was like oh so i'm just gonna bulk buy this mean green crap and repackage it and sell it for forty dollars as opposed to i sold it for like forty dollars for like some like a like a carmex size or like a you know like a like a chapstick size thing when it costs like 40 for like literally an industrial sized barrel and i just repackage it and i was making thousands of dollars a month and then i quit doing it because i was like i don't want to do this anyway it was kind of a cool thing but i shut it down because i was like all right this is making money but like i don't want to do this i'm not proud of this this isn't like anything i i like to talk to tell people i'm doing it's kind of lame even though i was making like five grand a month shut it down and um the point is the thing that we're doing now i have a feeling it's gonna lead to something even bigger and uh in in coinbase's regard everything was much bigger in a much shorter time frame but uh it doesn't matter it's the the exercise i think is still true that's great uh you know those guys who came and set up uh my studio here they just released a vlog on his channel this guy henry i forgot his nasty henry blancaster or something like that i don't know what it is but basically i don't know how you'll find them henry uh on youtube he did this thing he put out a video yesterday being like oh the advice that i got from sean poury and i was like okay well i'm one of his like i don't know 100 subscribers like i'll click this this is about me so i will go ahead and watch this video and his videos are actually super well made he's like yeah very casey neistatish like any casey neistat yeah yeah uh which just shows how hard it is to win on youtube like his quality is really high but like no one gives a [ __ ] because it's just youtube there's a billion things on there hey as we said just give it some time and just keep trying right so so the advice and i was like i'm curious what the advice was because they came over and they were like doing all the work and i'm just sort of standing in the garage with like a cup of coffee just like you know just sort of like trying to be nice i'm not helpful but i was like trying to talk to them and i was like and they're like you know hammering things and i'm just like asking them questions and giving them some kind of like well here's how i would do it if i was you guys because i really resonate with anybody who's like if you're like 22-23 and then you you're smart but you chose not to go the traditional path and like that feels right but then you also just get these like hunger pangs of like doubt when it's like [ __ ] my friends actually have a salary wait like i'm sleeping in a like you know four of us are sleeping in this one bedroom apartment and um and so i started like i really like empathize with that because that's where i was and uh like i just want to tell them what i what i would tell myself which is like dude you're doing the right thing here's how you need to think about this though don't like don't worry uh hey you know here's how here's how this is gonna play out and what i told them was like look honestly the best times of my life were three of us living in a you know one bedroom apartment my my co-founder and my roommate lived in my closet because he couldn't even afford our dirt cheap rent so trevor lived in my closet and like turned my living closet into like a room for himself with a lava lamp and [ __ ] and then like his girlfriend moved in with him in the closet too oh my god and so then uh i was like you know he had a grocery cart because there's no he didn't have a closet because he was living in a closet so he stole a shopping cart rolled it into his closet and used that as like his hamper his closet for himself and i just remember like like at the time everything seemed so shitty it was like oh this is the shitty version of life and now i'm like no that was the that was the most fun time because all we were doing every day was just trying to figure [ __ ] out trying new different schemes and projects we had no responsibilities no burn and then we were just like party for fun like on the side and so i just remember thinking like now that i look back i'm like that was the [ __ ] that's what i was trying to tell them i was like first of all guys this is the best so like uh like embrace this part you're never going to get to have this again with your friends like you have right now it's it's so fun embrace these five years i said the second thing is like i used to chase money a lot like how do i make money maybe this will make us money maybe this will make some money and that was good because i like learned skills about how to make money but the things that actually paid off none of those really paid off with a big dollar amount the things that paid off were like the people i was meeting and like doing projects with or learning from like those relationships pay off big in the end um you know the learning of like building skills around like i did my first ecom project like you i was selling these wristbands called fatbans.com and it was just a fat rip fat wristband that i like noticed a bunch of kids were wearing on on campus i thought oh wait maybe that's a trend let me try to sell those online you can customize them and so um those skills translated but the the business did not and so what i told them the advice that he put in the video um that i didn't even realize i said was like you're 23 years old now like here's the trick to this whole thing you're doing the right thing every day you're just making stuff you're trying stuff you're making content you're having a blast with your buddies we're going to measure the scoreboard when you're 30 not when you're 24. and it's like that was the game changer like kind of like advice i wish i had and that i gave them maybe 35 or 40. right but basically it's like don't like you're planting seeds don't go dig up that seed the next day and be like [ __ ] this didn't grow into a plant like no plant that seed water it enjoy it and just say look i'm not trying to win the whole game in one year uh in a year and a half and like if my if my friends who took this banking job or consulting job or are doing better than me in 18 months like i don't need to feel like i made a bad choice like i'm making the right choice for me and it's gonna like let's look at this as a 10-year game and we can only measure the score that like the fourth quarter is 10 years from now so that's the only time you can look at the scoreboard really and the seeds that you're planting at least in my experience and i think in a lot of my friend's experience and it also seems like you for sure uh is it's [ __ ] it's [ __ ] it's [ __ ] it's [ __ ] and then suddenly it's like oh my god it worked it hits yeah like so it like it's [ __ ] for the most of the time and then finally it's like oh okay now it's all happening your learning goes in this like gradual curve like your learning does go up every year where you're like oh man last year i was such a dummy i didn't know [ __ ] about [ __ ] and now i know better how i would do this and then the same thing happens the next year and the next year and the next year but your results can kind of stay flat-lined for like a decade almost for like seven years before it actually you know stops being a flat line and just like curves up rapidly so i wanted to continue talking about this but i'm actually going to save my stuff that i have these notes here i'm going to save that for the next time because i don't want this episode to be entirely this stuff although frankly i love this stuff do you like this or not yeah man i'm just soaking it all in okay um i like this stuff but sean you want to move on you want to do the other thing you want to do micro choir or do you want to keep talking about this uh i don't want to keep talking about this i want to do either some great micro car or some ideas i want to do micro acquire and this is an idea actually but uh we at the hustle we worked with this guy and i never talked to him because um i wasn't the one working on the project but anyway i just started hanging out with him recently this guy named andrew uh people call him gaz but his last name was like gaznati or something how do you know andrew or something yeah guys ducky uh i think they can just call him gaz uh do you know andrew or do you know who he is i did the like the minis back with him so that's the only way i know him just through dms i've never talked to him andrew is 32 i think um he previously had a company that i think was an agency and he told me that he sold it for like tens of millions of dollars so it was very very successful but his new thing is incredibly interesting it's called microacquire i think it's just microacquired.com that's right and the premise is very simple uh he finds people that want to he that wants to sell their their company and he just talks about it in a newsletter it's basically like appsumo or like the hustle but a newsletter that just sends out cool companies except what he does is he makes you pay money to be access to to get access to it you only have to pay 200 300 though and you get a year's access and his numbers are pretty interesting and keep in mind andrew's actually the only employee so no one works there um and so as of today he's got 1500 subscribers paying 299 a year and that brings his revenue to about 400 000 a year and i posted a chart of this do you see the chart i posted uh no i'm on his twitter because i was looking for that because i know he posts oh here it is yeah no i have the chart so i posted it um and i'll he just sent this to me so i guess i mean i said can i share it he builds in public so he he announces the revenue publicly as part of his like way of getting more traffic so he's got 425 arr and look at that chart yeah that's a pretty amazing chart um really all the growth happened like in november december january february like it just lasts like four or five months yeah and it's pretty interesting and i actually shared with you if you scroll down a little bit more i shared with you his his vision but what this guy is building uh i mean this is his vision we'll see if he can pull it off um is a different type of angel list so basically he wants to disrupt investment banking and he wants to make it easier to buy and sell companies and it's incredibly fascinating so he wants or sorry not disrupt angelus but kind of be like angel listen when you describe what it is so what it is you go on there if you want to buy a small sas business so a small business that makes recurring revenue through subscription and um and so that's the that's that's the thing i browse and the size are it ranges so it could you could buy one for five thousand dollars that's making a hundred dollars a month of revenue or something like that or zero dollars revenue but it has users so you could buy it for as low as like a thousand or five thousand dollars you could buy a business and as high as there's a couple for like single-digit millions of dollars on on there maybe there's a few that are outliers but that's like i would say the sweet spot the range for these things are kind of like hundreds of thousands of dollars is like where the you know decent businesses are on this platform and this is the thing where i talked about this once on the pod but he had dm'd us and he was like hey like love my first million you guys are great would you know would you guys want to do something with me where i like give away a 5 000 micro sas business and i was like dude that's a great idea i'll like go in with you and like i'll pump this to the audience and so basically i tweeted out like i didn't even talk to him i didn't actually respond to his dm i just tweeted out hey me and andrew are giving away a sas business for five thousand dollars like who wants it oh you know all the business is there we'll buy it and give it to you it's like these are business that are already working to some extent you know uh it's like we just need to add some hustle who's a hustler who wants this business and what ended up happening was a bunch of other people started chiming in being like i'm in for 5k i'll put 5k in and so we ended up raising a hundred thousand dollars as a micro spec meaning a blank check company so we raised a hundred thousand dollars into an entity to go and use that entity to go buy a business off of micro micro and then as of last week it closed so we found an entrepreneur found a business and we closed that deal to buy a shopify app that's amazing and that's pretty wild uh i'll be eager to see what happens but i'm sure you'll reveal in like six to twelve months um my opinion around micro acquire is at worst it's gonna be okay right at best it could be amazing i don't know what it's gonna what's gonna happen to it what do you think it's a really fascinating business and i the the thing is now i'm actually shocked he's letting me talk about it because i feel like i can clone this so quickly uh yeah it's a lot of work like i saw this guy doing the the one deal we did and it was just like [ __ ] ton of work till this like you know separate everything to make it happen do the paperwork get a field yeah but that's not the work for micro acquire well they have to help you do the transaction so so that's their that's their function um it's what's good is that they don't make money on the like transaction closing they make money on you paying a premium subscription like i pay a monthly fee to be able to browse businesses which is a much better model because you're not just reliant on taking a brokerage fee of closed m a because there's just not a lot of closed m a that happens but there are a lot of people who are curious and will pay the you know 100 bucks or whatever it is 200 bucks to be able to like browse the premium listings and get the get the details get the info and so what i would do if i was andrew is i would decrease the price to 99 a year because that not or even 39 a year because that would make it an impulse buy and i would get loads of people then i would do this company selling then i would have a course that cost two thousand five thousand dollars and it would include a community and was all focused on buying and selling companies growing businesses and i'm pretty i'm pretty confident that you could get that to around 30 40 50 million dollars a year in business i don't know if that would be a valuable company to um sell but i'm pretty sure that you can make 10 to 20 million dollars a year in profit for at least a handful of years i think that's what i would i think it's needed so i think it's smart that he specializes in sas i think that it's smart that he's a curated marketplace versus like flippa or these different places where you're just like so much [ __ ] junk you don't know what there's no trust so i think he's doing it right that he's bringing trust to these kind of like lower trusts like marketplaces so i i'm with you i really liked the project and i'm with you that the minimum is a good outcome the maximum is like oh wow this was a big idea hidden in plain sight and um i'll i think it's interesting i think it's more likely gonna just be the good outcome but i like that it has the you know the option to do both and it seems like a fun a fun kind of way to build if you're this guy i think he wants it to be the okay outcome which is he owns it and he lives a really good lifestyle right and uh which by the way i think like i would probably do the same as well yeah um so anyway that's a cool company i wanted to bring up what do you got uh i got a couple okay so i'll go for um we talked about this before but i'm curious what you think so um photo p uh we talked about this many many months ago but yeah we were much smaller than people those people are probably not even listening anymore so we'll just pretend it's the first time so there's this thing called photop and all it is is it's photoshop but it's free and it's in the browser you don't have to download anything and the guy who makes it i don't know much about it he posts on reddit or you know he he has posts on reddit it's a pretty big thread i think you know a little more about him than i do with kind of like the backstory but it's a free version of photoshop that has cloned every feature of photoshop pretty much it's like it's the exact ui of photoshop which is crazy because photoshop is such a complicated piece of software to build and this guy just chipped away just chipped away just chipping away and basically built photo p and p as in uh like the vegetable like p-e-a and so uh photop.com you go there and it's just like one banner ad that's like how he makes money i think i think it does a million dollars a year now because so many people use this goddamn thing like students and like people who don't want to spend photoshop's really expensive people who don't want to buy photoshop can use photo p and get like 80 to 90 of the same power without any of the cost and without any of the headache of downloading a big ass one gigabyte application what uh oh my god i'm on it so we do i know this person is that what you're saying i remember the first time we brought it up you had already heard about it because i was like dude this i have a really obscure thing and then you're like mr obscure so you're like oh yeah i've seen this on reddit uh at the time i saw i remember being like shocked that you knew about this thing because i thought i just discovered like uncovered gem you know yes i see it's from november 2018 uh a guy yes because it ha it got 50 000 upvotes and he started it by saying i made a free alternative to photoshop ask me anything and that's how he got promotion for it yeah i like this um so you think he's making a million dollars a year doing this yeah so i i don't i don't know why ben told me this ben gave me this topic and he was like photo p you know he's like you know photo b was like yeah he's like you know it's been a million dollars a year so if i'm wrong ben's wrong i didn't look at myself but um by the way i got access to similar web i've got a premium account now bro you got the goods yeah i uh someone who works at hubspot uh i'll i don't know if i can blow up their anyway i got similar web dude i'm the same way where at twitch i was like oh dude you got a premium app annie account that's like a couple thousand books a year to see app download stuff like share the login and they're like you know we're like a company you just buy a seat and it's just the company pays for the seat if you think you would use this just to buy it i'm like oh my like i felt like such a pirate like i had to like hide i was like oh yeah of course of course i wouldn't boot like that like well yeah that's not what i meant that i'm still trying to like be a little bit less hood rats him and more like oh yeah it's like this is roi positive just buy it right right uh it's actually like very much looked down upon to be that way like i was negotiating with somebody and they're like wait why are you trying to like why are you trying to like save us all this money negotiating with this vendor like just pay the thing and do it up front and be like but this goes against like everything in my jeans i can't not do it i was like yeah but it's in the motel 6. like i saved us at 200 i always used to tell people yeah like i'll take care of your accommodation and it was that they would actually be sleeping in my stand on my aunt's house and i would actually go i would stay at my girlfriend's house and they would get my bedroom i did that all the time yeah we'll take care of your accommodation uh because we get hustle god they just slept at my house so according to similar web photo p gets 8.5 million uh monthly uniques they spend a ton of time on the website and most all the traffic is direct so i if you told me that this made a million dollars i would think are you sure it's not a million dollars a month uh i don't know because i i got it i gotta check i don't think it's a month i think that would be pretty pretty crazy i think i think a year because you know he's only he's not monetizing well right he's just got display ads so he's you know he's got the bottom of the barrel monetization i think on the on the site yeah you could probably crush this though um speaking of just well go ahead well i was just going to say like you know okay to so what so i think there's so what here is a photo piece cool and interesting and like just a cool thing to know about but b like couldn't you do this for more things like first of all take the whole adobe suite and do the photo p for after effects do the photo p for illustrator photo p4 for the whole suite right like anything that has over x million users um you could do this for what else like maybe it's like autocad like i don't know if that's free or if you pay for it or whatever you know like uh i forgot like uh what's that thing called math lab matlab or something like that it's a thing that all the engineers have to use um like is matlab paid is you know great can you can you do this and i think a version of this is uh called obs so have you ever used obs no what's that obs is an open source uh piece of software that's basically the most popular thing for every twitch streamer or youtuber so it's the easiest way to like stream from a pc high quality video and audio to twitch to whatever so for years twitch actually just until recently twitch didn't have any way if you went to twitch like great i want to be a streamer they're like cool go go use obs what the hell is obs twitch doesn't have a button just saying go live and uh same thing with youtube you go live on youtube nope can't just go live on youtube with uh without like using more sophisticated software and so obs is actually an open source project maintained by a small community developer but really it's just one guy jim and i met this guy and jim's like you know i don't know five foot seven and like long hair down to his kind of waist and he looked like an open source you know like app developer and he's like extremely high ethics and morals where he's just like the app is 100 free he's been working on it for a decade and it's supported by donations of people who are like dude i i run my whole business off obs like sure here's ten dollars you know and um and twitch twitch actually was paying him every month uh just to keep maintaining obs because it was like cheaper to just pay jim i don't know x thousands of dollars a month than to like have 20 engineers trying to recreate this thing i think that that is cool i think that like when i hear that i'm like that's badass like i love that that i love that that exists right but what was my what was my thing earlier i'm like cornrows and sleeve tattoos i i respect it and i think that's badass i just don't want it it ain't for me i'm not wearing it uh and that's the that's my case with this which is i'm so happy that that exists i ain't doing it because there's a bunch of examples of this so another example is spicework spiceworks.com they were doing like 50 60 70 million dollars a year in revenue and they ended up selling and because they raised too much money it didn't work out but they had traction and basically what what spikes or spiceworks did was they created uh software so if you're like if you have like um um a thousand employees and you wanted to figure out which computers you needed to buy they created software to help you figure that out which normally costs money and they actually made money through advertising on the website in my opinion that's like neat but just charge people money for your thing because i'd like would you rather be photo p or adobe uh yeah i know what's worse of course i know which one i'd rather be so i think it's cool to actually do that free stuff just to get a ton of users but after a while like if i was photo p i would be like well if i just i should just hire more engineers and we should make some premium features and up charge and that is what i would do i would not do this well there's another way of looking at it which is sometimes like free doesn't mean no ambition so for example skype was like hey free international you know like calling and whatsapp same thing why did whatsapp take off because sms was actually really expensive you had to pay for every tax especially international texting it was super expensive so what's that free was the growth hack and for these guys i would say free is also the growth hack but you know if you're if you want to just be one person maintaining this thing and like whatever like you're where you do it matters so photoshop is still at least big but nowhere near as big as texting and calling was right that was like such a huge market and then the second thing is like if you're gonna do free find some other way to capture a ton of value so uh skype and whatsapp we're able to capture a bunch of value using a totally different method whereas photo piece just like cool here's a here's one banner ad um you know and that's enough for me or obs is like hey donate to me and that's it whereas obs could have like created you know either premium features or sold to twitch or you know could have done many things to try to capture more value out of the free thing that they made do you know the website unsplash so unsplash is a alternative to getty's images so getty's images uh everyone has probably heard that word not a lot of people probably use it we used it we paid them 50 grand a year and we were a small client getty images they pay photographers they buy right why were you paying so much because there's cheaper or freer options for photo libraries gettys is the best um so a lot of free or cheap ones they don't actually have images of of the people so for example if you want to write about elon musk a lot of the free ones don't have good pictures of elon musk second once you get to the size that we were like we like which is not that big once you get past like 500 000 monthly uniques you probably want to stop doing things illegally when it comes to photos because there's all these people that yeah and which is like a it's the right thing to do right you you are using other people's stuff so you shouldn't do it it's okay to kind of bootleg it early on but after a while you should pay for it uh and we were a small person we were and we paid i think 50 i forget tens of thousands of dollars and anyway there was this competitor called unsplash i think unsplash is dope i think they're badass they're just acquired acquired recently i got a little information where i like i found i heard a little bit about what they were doing they were only doing around four ish million dollar five million dollars a year in revenue even though like hundreds of millions of their images for being downloaded right and i was actually shocked at how small they were um if i had that much traction a i would have been far more aggressive about selling ads on the site and be far more aggressive about getting subscriptions and charging a lot of money for them because this website unsplash which from the outside appeared to be doing wildly well and i imagine they actually were acquired for a lot of money because if a proper person could get their hands on that they could crush it i would think but um if if you have that much usage like unsplash [ __ ] unsplash wasn't ubiquitous but it was quite popular you can make way more money by charging money up front for all that stuff when unsplash giving away their stuff for free i think they're only doing like 400 500 000 a month in revenue right right right uh okay yeah that's a good that's a good example of one i had one other topic i wanted to do um okay which one's more interesting to you is it the affirm for x or is it game film for salespeople i'll let you pick from those two categories uh a firm and i have a i have a take on there that you're not gonna like oh okay good good all right so uh if you don't know what a firm is a firm was a company started by um max levchin i think uh am i mixing this up right all right so max levchen the co-founder of paypal uh the firm went public i think this year or last year it's about 17 18 billion dollar company right now and what a firm does is when you're on an e-commerce site you're going and you're buying a mattress online you go to casper's website and it'll be like oh wow this mattress is twelve hundred dollars and it'll say or or for you know 96 easy payments of eight dollars you can own this mattress right so it's basically a pay-as-you-go software that lets e-commerce stores sell more stuff because uh if people don't have the full amount or don't or you know they're hesitant to spend a large amount of money right now you can offer them pay as you go plans with a zero effort and then they take a cut so you know uh you know on on our ecommerce store we offer we use one called sell and sezzle will uh basically say great you could buy this thing for you know four payments or eight payments of ten dollars instead of paying the full amount right now and um and then they take seven percent and then they send us the rest of the money and so it's kind of a no-brainer as a retailer because it just it really does improve conversion and for us customers were asking for it because they were used to buying it and it's up it's it's publicly traded company now it does really well and so and there's several of these so there's after pay in australia which is even bigger after pays a 34 billion dollar company which is kind of interesting because normally australian companies are much much smaller uh klarna is like big in europe i think for this i think klarna is even bigger than all of them exactly so karna's probably the biggest one and um so there's kind of this war going on they're all trying to like um like i think a firm partnered with shopify so it's like built into shopify now uh that's a big move but basically okay pay as you go interesting space uh kind of was one of the big ideas that just came out in the last like 10 years and is a good example of once it started working in the u.s it was not hard for people to just be like cool we're gonna do we're gonna do a firm for australia we're gonna do a firm for the uk we're gonna do a firm for india whatever right so i think generically that was a good business idea what i thought was interesting is what else could you use it for so i heard of one company in this uh this year's yc batch that was doing pay as you go how did you get access to that bro big time investors like us that's what we get access to actually yc still has not accepted me into the investor pool even though i've invested in probably like 10 yc companies at this point um yes but but uh but i have a friend who gave access so so that's no problem um so anyways one of the companies uh what they do is they're a firm for general contractors so another high ticket item you're getting you know your garage redone or whatever bathroom remodeled or you're building out you know a multi-family apartment complex or whatever um they're giving the general cut they what they did is they went to the general contractor just like that's their version of the e-commerce store and they say hey instead of charging your client 12 grand for this you can just offer them pay as you go and it helps your clients pay you money and you get a higher collection rate you have less less kind of late payments and defaults um and higher conversion rate because people can afford you this way it makes you more affordable and uh they were doing all right they had you know decent revenue and uh you know it was early still but i thought oh this is interesting are people going to do pay as you go in more more industries more more sectors and what else might be okay but here's my tip here's my take klarna after pay and affirm i like the people who start them i think they're horrible companies for the world i think that they you they should burn down completely and not exist i think that why because it's getting people in debt it's getting people in debt it's making you buy stupid [ __ ] that you can't afford so where like where's the firm like if you go to like fashion nova like people who can't afford who people who want to do a firm for a 29 pair of pants i'm like don't buy those [ __ ] pants don't use a firm don't buy any of this you don't need this [ __ ] don't buy it do not buy it run and also if you're gonna have to buy it don't go in debt to buy it i think this is horrible and i'm actually shocked at a guy like max lipchin who i think is a cool dude he started paypal he started all this stuff that's badass like i seemed like a nerd i love nerds what are you doing this is useless you're just you know you know just started how he got the idea tell me he was um so this is the version of the story i know i'm gonna be you know somebody who was there probably knows a lot more details but what i had heard was there was an engineer who had uh so he had this lab like i had monkey inferno he had a lab called hvf hard valuable fun and basically it was an incubator where he said i'm gonna do any project that satisfies those three criteria it's gotta be hard it's gotta be valuable it's gotta be fun and so uh and then they kind of like didn't have um like i think they've had a few nice companies glow came out of it's fertility tracker and then a firm was the big one and max like went all in and he became the ceo of a firm and all that stuff to take it forward but the origin story from what i heard was as an engineer who had come up with like a new uh like database technology or database technique he's like oh look at this he's like basically nerding out he's like look at this we could do like so much computation and so little time and like with this new technique and i was like okay but what are you gonna use that for it's just kind of like blockchain it's like great your blockchain but like why do we need a blockchain what are we gonna use it for does it really make this better and like there's you need to define an application so the way that blockchain found money currency as as the core killer app uh what he what max realized was he came into the this guy was an eir for him so for months he was just like working on this like databasing technology and how he was going to use it couldn't really figure out an application and then one day max walks in he goes dude like credit scoring and credit reporting is so like ancient we should be able to like if you're a person today i should be able to take signals from the internet social social networking data uh publicly available data on the internet to do instant credit uh worthiness versus like the way that this works today with this kind of like you go get a credit score and it's based off of like you know stuff in the past so his insight was there has to be a better way to determine the credit credit worthiness of a person and he's like your databasing technology is actually perfect for doing that on the fly and doing that at scale and so they came together and he's like great i'm gonna like basically create this application to do this and i think at first they didn't want to do i don't think the initial very initial idea was what they ended up doing which was like pay as you go on e-commerce websites but pretty quickly they realized that's the use case that's the market that needs this the most is basically instead of um like i guess my question to you would be do you also feel do you also use a visa and mastercard like because it's just credit cards that's all this is it's just credit um so do you also hate credit cards the same way you hate pay as you go you want to know what's funny is uh my credit my personal credit card limit is four thousand dollars um so i've got a i've i've never had any debt other i just got more are you one of those people that uses debit cards instead of credit i do it because lately someone has advised me to do it but for a long time no but i'm not against credit uh and i realize that what i'm saying is not entirely logical it's definitely emotionally driven and you're saying and i'm not like going this hardcore libertarian route which is like well i'm like against the government therefore all government is bad i'm like no no no like i'm gonna draw so what i'm doing right now is basically i'm drawing the line right which i get uh it's does that's not always the best but i think that credit cards in some cases are good and affirm in most cases are bad that's what i think okay i think that's you know that's why because the people like do you know do you have any uh do you know like in europe like our friend ramon and a lot of my other uh friends from europe they were like you know credit cards we don't use credit cards like in germany yeah like in a lot of places in europe if you want to use also we use bidets proper cleaning yeah which by the way whenever people were flipping out over covet and toilet paper i'm like dude take a shower like what the [ __ ] you flip it out over this why are you fighting over this uh anyway um you're going to shower every time you [ __ ] could be twice a day but like it's it's the inconvenience is not bad enough that i'm going to fight over that that's fine that's right that's what i'm saying i'm not going to like stab someone and like uh or i'll just be uncomfortable anyway um i just think like credit cards aren't that common in europe uh there it's definitely an american thing but long story short i am not in favor of a firm uh i think that that is a stupid thing to spend his life working on that's my opinion i would love for him if i could go to him or bait him into coming on here and convincing me of otherwise because i'm open-minded but i think it's dumb i think it's stupid for general contractors that's a little bit different but for buying like a 29 pair of pants like don't [ __ ] buy the pants well i uh my family member trains his daughter in jiu jitsu and so maybe maybe we could use the the daughter jiu jitsu connection to get max on the pod uh very soon uh am i wrong though do you agree or disagree i disagree i disagree completely i think credit is a great thing it helps the economy move i i'm always a kind of don't hate the player hate the game type of situation where i put the burden on the individual in the same way that i wasn't like oh my god jewel or like you know like is you know is is grey goose evil because it's alcohol and alcohol causes problems no like i don't think so i think it i basically for myself i live my life or i never blame a company for tricking me into like doing something i blame myself if i don't have the self-control and the like thought process to do it and so that's how i look at others too i will never blame a credit card company for um for somebody getting in debt now what i do say is if you're not transparent about what the fees are what the charges are what the rates are then that's shady right you're withholding information you're not disclosing you're hiding the fees but um but in this case they don't charge people more uh for you know for buying a lot of the times it's zero percent interest actually because they they can offer the customers zero percent interest because they take seven percent from the merchant for helping them close the sale and so it's actually an interesting model compared to that's interesting i didn't know i didn't know the full depends on the credit worthiness like when i i bought a eight sleep mattress using a firm and i was like because i was like oh do i want to spend like two grand right now oh i'll try this a firm thing and i was like oh this is cool i can just pay in payments and it's zero percent interest because i had well i tried doing it i also have a sleep i tried doing it with there and i actually was gonna have to pay like a pretty hefty fee i was like oh no because you don't use credit cards you don't have high credit something like for some reason i don't have a good credit my credit score is is not bad anymore but it was bad uh because i didn't have history anyway well i have one one last idea on this which is um i think this is the same thing as like you probably know what layaway is i don't even really fully understand what layaway is layaway sounded like a total scam to me it's silly it's silly basically like what it is if you want to buy a 500 thing you would go each week and you would give them a little bit of money and would start paying down your balance and then eventually you'd get the item right but it's crazy because like with a firm you get the item first and then you pay later buy now pay later right that's that's well you have to remember there's a one big thing which is like is that if if it's gonna take you three months to purchase and you can't if you don't have the internet to buy stuff like you want to guarantee that they're gonna like that's yours right i guess for me it's like our items really out of stock but apparently there's a huge thing like walmart like in most parts of the country layaway is like a huge part of their business um and it's a it's a it seems like a pretty predatory thing in a way but i i don't know too much about it so i shouldn't really speak on it but um anyways i guess my my point is why aren't people doing a firm for retail stores so why isn't this the same option every time i check out you know my wife goes and shops at i don't know wherever you know nordstrom like when she checks out they're like oh you know do you want to open a nordstrom card or whatever why isn't it hey um you want to pay the full amount today or would you like to pay in installments and you could pay an assault now maybe this is already the case i don't know but like it seems like something that should be built into the point of sale at retail stores i don't do a ton of retail shopping so yeah this might be me being dominant actually is totally a thing does a firm plug into shopify yes and do a lot of people use shopify too but like nordstrom doesn't use it but like a coffee shop might yeah not really they're trying to do more that square is definitely trying to do a lot of like retail plus online like you know brick and mortar and online um so maybe square does it but uh but i think a lot of retailers just have their old school pos still this is like one of those rare topics that you're bringing up and i'm like oh i don't know like how do people buy stuff at stores i've done it yeah we should just smoothly exit this topic before we uh i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
when i i first hosted my uh i hosted my first event in june and the event happened or i decided to do it around june 1st and the event went place seven weeks later in august and when i started i had close to nothing i had a 200 person email list so there wasn't like this oh it's easy for you you had the hustle no no it didn't exist uh there was no website there was just a domain name called hustle cut um and i hosted this event in the first six weeks it made about sixty thousand dollars in revenue and fifty ish thousand dollars in profit and a lot of people were surprised by that it was but it wasn't that hard the second event you can see here explain so how did you sell the sixty thousand dollars of tickets during that process i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like my days off on the road let's travel never looking back today sean let's actually jump right you i think want to do this billy of the week right away and then i have a thing on events do you want to do events or you want to save that what do you want to do i want to do that so i want to do this billy of the week i want to hear your stuff on paid events and then i have two ideas one is a cool idea i've seen and then the other is a brainstorm of a potential idea so i want to do all those things so let's start with let's start with the billy of the week um this one is very interesting have you ever heard of this guy before don't don't google it i want to tell you the story so don't don't google this guy all right let me tell you a picture i'm just i i google them i'm just thinking oh wow okay yeah uh young guy young guy 29 years old i don't know who he is his name is wow sam bankman freed i think it's the way you say his name and uh when you if you heard him talk like i actually want you to listen to a youtube video for a second because he sounds like you know an absolute dweeb and i loved it i was like oh this guy sounds like he would be a self-made billionaire by the age of 29 because he sounds like a genius he sounds like a tech genius have you brought this person up to me before no i just discovered him like two days ago okay so what's this guy's story so this guy you know i'll just come sam for short but uh so this guy sam he's a he he's a young guy he's very smart um he takes a job as kind of like a hedge fund trader or something like that with a group called jane street i guess and uh i don't know i forget these details they don't really matter guys got a job in finance and he leaves and he starts something called alameda research and it's called alameda research because he needed it to sound as legit as possible and not like what it actually was so what was it so what this guy did was he was into crypto and there was this known thing in crypto where as crypto was getting popular this is around 2017 when the first big run-up happened and bitcoin went you know from three thousand dollars to twenty thousand dollars and it crashed later but during that time 2016 2017 2018 bitcoin was emerging and there was this as any new thing there's these like kind of uh it's like the wild wild west a little bit and so there was this thing where in the u.s the price of bitcoin was let's say 10 000 of bitcoin and in other countries where um the exchanges weren't built or the com the country had some regulations or whatever there was like a premium for bitcoin there was more demand than there was bitcoin available to buy in those countries uh because you need like let's say like in korea there was a famous uh thing called the kimchi the kimchi premium and the kimchi premium was that in korea there wasn't kimchi like the uh like the the food so this was known as the kimchi premium and basically it was like uh whatever bitcoin was selling for here let's say it was ten thousand dollars in korea it was trading for fifteen thousand dollars because it was that bigger fifty percent premium and it fluctuated obviously and i think 30 was kind of like the average of the kimchi premium over time so everybody wanted this so everybody you know any smart person saw oh wow there's an arbitrage what if i could just buy it in the u.s for 10 grand and immediately sell it in korea for 15 grand or for 30 you know 13 grand and so you had this like ability to flip it and so a whole bunch of people were trying to do this but there was all these problems right like well the reason you know the reason wasn't easy the reason there was this premium is because it was hard to buy bitcoin in korea so one idea was you buy it in the u.s off a u.s exchange you go to korea and you sell it but you're gonna sell it for in the korean you know wan which is like the local currency but now you need to like for the for the arbitrage to continue you have to convert the korean wand back to dollars to go buy more go buy more bitcoin in the us the problem was you can't convert the korean wand back to dollars easily because the government was very like tight fisted regulations you couldn't funnel large amounts of money from the korean wand back to dollars very very easily so a whole bunch of people were trying to get this like pinata of money and they couldn't crack it and what this guy did was he was like okay [ __ ] the kimchi premium he went for the japan premium which was far less appealing it was only 10 but he's like still if i can if i could trade a u.s bitcoin for 10 more in japan every day i'm making 10 compounding daily and so he went through this like odyssey where for like a year all he's doing is setting up this trade so he like for actually by the way first when he was trying to figure out could i capture the kimchi premium he was like doing calculations like if i filled up if i chartered a private plane and i filled it up with a hundred people and i flew you know they buy bitcoin in the us and i flew them all to korea and then they they you know sell it there and then i could each one of them could convert some amount of that money and i could fly them back and every day i could fly this plane back and forth between us and korea like could i make it work and he was like i don't think it works so wait so you had to be there physically it's not that you had to be there physically you have to do all like all legs of the transaction so you have to be able to buy in korea or like sell your bitcoin in korea at the premium but now you have korean wan now you need to convert that to dollars and so how do you do that you need to convert it there but there's caps they won't let you convert it because the way he described it is like look he's like what i wanted to do essentially was to be you know selling five million dollars of bitcoin for the local currency and converting five million of local currency back to us dollars every day it's like if you if you just go to like go to korea go to japan go to wherever and you say hey i'd like to it's like a one-way flow of money i have five million dollars of your local currency i'd like to convert it to dollars and exit the country um and they're like okay but where are you getting all this money and why are you doing such a large amount like what is this yeah he's like you know if you if you go to bank school 101 that's like money laundering that's what money laundering looks like that that is what money laundering that is exactly what money laundering looks like so he's like even though i'm not money laundering i'm buying and selling a good that's differently priced in different regions to them on the ground to the bank on the ground where i need to do these conversions it's shady it's too shady they won't let me do it so he spends like a year of his life where he's like goes to japan now he's got to find uh he's got to do each each one of these was hard so anyways the net end of this story is this guy's arbitraging 25 million dollars a day of of this currency he's making a 10 compounding uh you know margin every single day and this guy you know in the three years basically he's become a self-made billionaire he's worth 10 billion dollars now which is a combination of the money he made from the arbitrage trade as well as he then created his own exchange um and like you know so he has a trading company that's you know has made hundreds of millions of dollars on this arbitrage and then he built he used that to create an exchange which is worth billions of dollars on paper so anyways this guy's worth 10 billion dollars he and his because uh the currency is called ftx right right that's his exchange his exchange called fps oh sorry sorry exchange and uh that is is that basically an alternative to basically a more higher end it's a more sophisticated coinbase where you can do like derivatives trades option trades on all different types of credits internationally and that's like and that's like a proper company it's a proper company with like so many research made hundreds of millions of dollars in the span of a few months just doing this one trade over and over again every day so i'm going to describe a couple things but he got on people's radar because he was the biggest donor to joe biden this year in the campaign he wrote a he wrote like a five million dollar check at the last hour like at the 11th hour that let joe do like you know as part of this like you know last minute blitz they did on tv ads in all the swing states uh because this this kind of interesting this guy's like very uh his whole business philosophy is this thing called effective altruism which is basically like go be a greedy capitalist go try to make as much money as you can and your goal is to give at least half of it away while you're doing it so he's got like it's not like a philanthropist giving away one percent of his money or 10 of his money as a tie his goal is giving away like 50 of his liquid liquid like net worth you know like that he makes every year that's his like kind of like his mindset where did he get the money to start this so he started it with a very small amount of money and it just compounded very quickly because he's basically getting 10 extra every day so i i don't know exactly where he got the initial seed capital or how big it was he hasn't specified that but he did say at the max they were doing 25 million a day on the trade which is basically like a 2.5 million like you know like profit per day uh that they were making on the trade and so he describes that okay so he's like basically if you want to do this you have to like break it down into small chunks he's like okay so i need on one side i need to be able to go buy a [ __ ] ton of bitcoin in the u.s so how do i get exchange in the u.s that's going to give me really high limits even though i'm this dorky kid who's got no track record and i have no like collateral or brand name and so he's like finds a way to solve that problem of like being able to buy 25 million dollars of bitcoin in the u.s then he had to like go to japan and he had to be able to sell a huge amount of bitcoin there then he had to be able to convert it from the japanese yen or whatever to us dollars and he had to do that all in the same day and wire transfer it all back to the us to buy it again the next day to buy the full max amount to get the next time every day and so he described like they would just the way that the timing worked it was always in the last hour of the banking day that he would be trying to get all the wire transfers done to get the money back to the us so that they can execute tomorrow's trade and any day that they couldn't what does he sound like you said he sounds crazy like i'm looking at pictures oh my god he sounds extremely genuine humble high-pitched voice kind of like just a nerdy guy um who was like he accounted for about ten percent of all the bitcoin trading himself his alameda research during that time period i believe which is just like insane because he was moving so much money dude i love these people i love i love freaks this guy is a freak this is his setup you know his desk is him with six monitors hanging above his head his neck is like cramped because he just needs to constantly monitor the spot price in the u.s what's the price in japan what's the conversion of yen to dollars what's the conversion of dollars here it is it's just constantly and any time anything broke it was just costing them tons of money and he had always had to make sure nobody's gonna like stop his trade to stop the bottleneck and then he's stuck with all this like japanese yen and can't move it or it gets seized by the government and so he was like the main banks wouldn't work with him so that's why he picked alameda research as a name to like be more legit he hired like this like kind of like sophisticated guy like who spoke the local language to be able to go talk to the bankers and be like hey here's what we're doing he also like went to like these rural banks in japan not the main ones in the city he's like okay these rural banks will take my business because they're like more open to what i'm doing than like the citibanks that are like you know have a tighter filter on what i'm doing so anyways i just thought it was super interesting to like he identified one arbitrage like moneyball style and then dedicated like a year or 18 months of his life to just hammering this one arbitrage and ended up making hundreds of millions of dollars and uh parlayed that into becoming you know his paper net worth is 10 billion dollars and he did that i think four years total of how he built 10 billion because the because the exchange the combination of the research the the trading company plus the exchange um 10 billion is what he what he estimates is his net worth to be god i love people like this i um i mean that's astounding there's very he's that's one of a kind but i love people and i try to do this with the hustle with email addresses uh with an email list but that's peanuts compared to this and what some other people do but basically who take a small tiny kind of like silly thing and just amp it up on steroids so i love that i think that is the coolest thing i love people who think like that i think it's so fascinating um i'd have to think of some more examples of that but you totally know what i mean right yeah absolutely i've met this before with like people who make a poker bot it's like what are you doing it's like every day there's tweaking this little bot that's running 24 7 at the at the one and two cent tables of full tilt poker and they have this like small edge like this like 15 percent edge and then they're just like tweaking the system and and what it reminds me of is what happens a lot of times is people will go buy information they'll go say oh i pay i pay like my uncle does this he was paying 19 a month for like this guy's like stock tips i had to like sit my uncle down and be like look like if these are amazing stock tips do you really think this guy's going to give it to you for 19 like no like you know if this guy really had an edge in the market he would not need to make money educating you he would be pounding his advantage right and trying to make as much money as he can as long as that window exists and so like oh i have another example this this guy on twitter called haralabob do you follow him no pretty fascinating guy to follow so this guy is a high stakes gambler he's a professional gambler which usually is an oxymoron uh like there's no such thing as a professional gambler but he he was a professional sports bettor and what he realized was back in i think 26 i forgot it was 2013 20 2012 i don't remember when it was like maybe it was even longer than that i think it might have been like 15 years ago now he realized that in vegas the books were like they were so sports books it's kind of like hard to beat the house the bookies are always like spot on and there's one type of bet called the you know over under it's basically like in basketball it's like what's the total score going to be is it going to be if you add up the total of both teams is it 200 more and you bet if it's gonna be over or under that and the over under is really really accurate but what he noticed was that um he noticed two things one was the bookies did not take into account that actually in the first half like in the basketball game the second half the score is usually higher than the first half because at the end of the game the team that's losing will start fouling uh because they're like look we have to try to get back in this game so i'll follow you to save the clock stops you get two free throws and then i'll come back try to hit a three and so that's usually the end game for most most teams like if you're down you foul the other team clock stops uh they score while the clock is stopped and then i try to shoot threes to get back in the game and i'm pretty desperate so what he noticed was that the total over under if you just divided it by half that's what they would just 50 that's what they were making as the first half over under and very few people bet the first half over under because it's not that fun of a bet it's like who cares what the halftime score is gonna be if you're gonna bet the score you just bet the end of the game score um so he realized it was a small edge where they thought they were taking the full score and dividing by half and making that the line he's like oh my god this is almost always going to be under and he specifically noticed that these three teams their coaches would like do that foul strategy way more in the second half so he's like okay there's these teams that these coaches do this strategy more and the first half is like my arbitrage and he doesn't say [ __ ] to anybody he just starts hiring people to go to the books all the different what's this person's name this guy harala bob and i'm kind of like i'm kind of paraphrasing about that it's h-a-r-a-l-a-b-o-b harala bob and so um and now he works for mark q he works for the dallas mavericks i think he works for mark cuban because he like wow got a big personality on twitter because he was the sports bettor and like the way he made all of his money was like he had identified over these like 10 years of being a sports bettor he found like three different edges one was he just like went super hard on the shaq and kobe lakers the second was this first half like uh first half over under bet that was just mispriced and he just took that missed pricing and he just went all in on this miss pricing wow this guy was crazy anytime a sports book would limit him he would then like pay a guy like hey go walk up and bet 25 000 of this game please and then he was like do that he had like people betting at all the sports books in all the different casinos at the same time so that he could be betting the type of money he wanted to bet to maximize his advantage while this arbitrage existed and so uh anyways i love people who find these arbitrages and then like the lengths that they have to go through to maximize it it's like the movie 21 where they're counting cards in vegas and they're like strapping cash to their body walking through this airport because they like need to go like palpable you used to have this guy who worked for you named steve or stephen i think yeah um he and then he so basically if i remember correctly what he did was he would create these i don't know if he created like so he would buy a really small twitter handle that was called like today in history and it would just tweet like a picture of what happened 50 years ago you know uh jfk was shot uh then he would buy like a cool car twitter one where it was like uh here's all interesting cars and then like i can't believe it it could fly which is like weird flying devices that when you look at them they look silly and he eventually bought i believe hundreds of them to the point of where he built a business so he did one of he did two things that were interesting the story you said was he goes basically i control the internet let me show you how by the end of the talk i'm going to have x trend right like i'm going to have this thing from the audience he'd be like say a word and people like gobbly [ __ ] he said all right cool while we're talking um in 30 minutes we'll just set a clock here we're going to check twitter in 30 minutes and then sure enough gobbledygook would be trending on twitter the number one trend in all of europe because his would all start talking about gobbledygook in meme format and it would just like start to go viral basically and nobody even knew it so what he and he he parlayed this into getting sponsorships and now i don't know if you know him anymore i don't know him at all yeah but i i read about him and i and this company went public it went public in a really shady way so i don't know if i believe everything there's something about it i don't have too much evidence it's just a roll-up of a bunch of bunch of media companies something was weird about it but basically i think it went public in england for like two or three hundred million dollars market cap and so it turned him into quite wealthy uh quite wealthy by the way he personally i think he just released a book called uh what is it happy sexy millionaire sexy millionaire yeah so go buy steve's book um yeah so anyway he found miss price assets so i remember the first one that he uh discovered was one that was like [ __ ] freshmen say or is like fr like but you know whatever the the the uk slang for that is it's basically like a me a parody account that tweeted out funny things that freshmen say on a college campus and what he found the reason it was mispriced was most of these accounts were made by accident by somebody who was 18 years old and 16 years old and they were bored at home and they just made a you know like harry potter you know harry potter jokes twitter account and it gets to a million followers and they don't know what to do with it and then they kind of like they get paid like 75 bucks on venmo to like shout out some app or like they get paid like 200 to like say a protein powder or like or they would make a blog selling you know like protein powder and they would just like try to funnel some traffic to that but it didn't like make sense it wasn't very sophisticated he needed he needed promotion for his business so he was working with these guys then he realized screw my business this is just a really powerful promotional engine we used him uh early on when he was you know we brought him on he was part of my team we used him and we became the number one app in the uk number one app in europe because we used his like network to like talk about our app and what he had the insight was was that you don't say like our app was bebo at the time so it wasn't go download bebo it's a great app no he's like that [ __ ] doesn't work i was like well we need that and we need the link in there so we can track how many clicks he gets he's like no that's not how people talk on the internet i was like okay so tell me what do you mean he's like you got to think like what you want to do is we have so many accounts that we want somebody when they scroll on twitter they see bebo mentioned like seven times and that they don't even nobody's explaining it nobody's selling it to them they just realized why is everyone saying this thing biba what is that and then they go google it or they go search for it and then they actually download the app because they think this is what's hot this is what people are talking about he's like so what we'll do is we'll make content that's like um you know my mom when she sees me check bibo for the 50th time today and it's a meme of the mom throwing your phone out the window and it's like so the the implied meaning is that bibo is this addictive app that you keep checking that your parents hate that you keep checking well what is that app why would why would this person check that out 50 times i don't even have that app never heard of it right and so that was the genius of his marketing like tactics at that time um and then he had the audience to back it up so they got spotify and microsoft and all these companies to pay them tons of money because anytime they needed to spread the word about a new thing that they were doing this was the most effective way to reach a bunch of people a bunch of young people and so then he parlayed that he started right launching his own consumer brand so if they have a bunch of food accounts they would launch like a food subscription product or they had a bunch of fitness accounts they would launch like a women's athletic wear you know like company it didn't all work but man like crazy ass like business that came you know if you if you want to go research it it's called social starts right social chain social chain uh steve what's his embarrassment yeah you should follow him on twitter he's a great follow uh now he tweets out just like i don't know inspirational [ __ ] all the time like motivational stuff yeah he's like a mini gary vee although he's like a better garyvee to be honest with you probably a ghetto yeah he's probably gonna give him like five years and he's gonna be much bigger than what gary v is today i think um if he sticks with it but uh yeah and there's some articles that are cool if you go search like the 21 year olds that control the internet i think there's like a vice article like 22 year olds control buzzfeed buzzfeed yeah so buzzfeed advice did like crazy articles about them i mean at one point they had 25 employees that were all under the age of 22 years old and they were all just managing these media accounts and they were just making tons of money and they like yeah it was insane they built like an office with like a playpen inside and you know like no it's a good article is it so do you want to talk okay so i was doing research abrayu showed me this and a few other people did basically our most watched recent video is something i you you've you've kicked ass on instagram i think i've got the youtube prize so far um but because our most watched article or most watched video is on paid communities i think the title is how to make 20 million dollars a year doing a paid community something like that um because we talked about a company that does that and now we'll make this title like how to make like a million dollars or how to make a hundred thousand dollars a year doing a paid event and a bray you asked me to talk about it so i came with a few bullet points so uh you want to talk about paid events i want to because this is how the hustle started so this is like your roots and also we're starting to plan hustle con again and i have a feeling now more than ever is the time to plan a paid event a in-person paid event because i think you can you can do really well because there's going to be very little competition and people are really eager to go we talked about it in the past uh about events but so sean if you go to the my the million-dollar brainstorm document uh you'll see i'm highlighting my name i actually listed all of oh you're on your phone so it might be a little challenging but i've actually listed a whole bunch of our old profit and loss statements from our events if you hit metrics all time you can actually see our all-time metrics although actually this only goes to 2018 so it's not all time it's missing three years but um you can kind of see the data you can see how much money we're making and we are making uh in the first cup in the first year of business about i think um i think about 500 000 with like 84 percent margin right in our first year business and so let's talk about events so i'll and this won't this isn't going to this is going to be a a 10-minute segment here probably but basically uh when i i first hosted my uh i hosted my first event in june and the event happened or i decided to do it around june 1st and the event went place seven weeks later in august and when i started i had close to nothing i had um a 200 person email list so there wasn't like this oh it's easy for you you had the hustle no no it didn't exist there was no website there was just a domain name called hustle cut and i hosted this event in the first six weeks it made about 60 thousand dollars in revenue and fifty ish thousand dollars in profit and a lot of people were surprised by that it was but it wasn't that hard the second event you can see here explained so how did you sell the sixty thousand dollars of tickets during that process i'm going to explain and and so i just want to give a little give one more bit of context the second event i think it made about 150 to 200 000 in revenue and something like 150 000 in profit and i did these events six months apart apart um i would basically host an event go travel when i needed money i would host another one and so i was starting each time with close to zero dollars so so let me explain to you guys a little bit about how i started my events and what i would what i would do if i was starting again which is basically if i was starting again i would do mostly the same stuff but i think everyone in the next if you're listening if you're willing to spend eight weeks working 40 hours a week dedicated to this i think you could make at least a hundred thousand dollars profit starting probably in september because that's when uh i think events conferences are going to be okay so anyway um the the biggest thing that you have to do here is your email list is the most important thing so the hustlecon.com i launched that website on june 6th okay and within just a few weeks we were averaging around a thousand or 2000 unique visitors a day and the email list jumped from about 200 people to about 2 500 people in seven weeks keep in mind at the time i didn't even have a twitter so there was no twitter i mean there was but i didn't use it and so what i would do is hustlecon.com was basically a landing page where i explained what the event is and then you'd enter your email and that was called the front door the side doors were all these blog posts so i would write two to three blog posts a week on each speaker i would post that on hacker news people would come to the website via the side door only five percent of them would say this is interesting what's this website and they would click the home page and i would collect their email there and then once i collected their email i would send them a variety of other blog posts that i'd written and at the end of each blog post that i sent them it would say ps this person is speaking at hustle account on uh august 1st in september you can get a ticket right now for 10 off if you buy in the next 12 hours right by the way the next 12 hours that code was working all the time it was always the next 12 hours the countdown clock there's a simple plug-in that you could buy and it just starts it shows up so sorry guys i'm sure everyone knows this now but i don't even shopify wasn't popular at that point so um not everyone had that technology but that's what we did pretty easy pretty basic and in doing that i'll give you an example of the blog post because i remember like i remember vividly the one you did about i cracked um which you kind of did like as i'm in infographic i remember the one of pandora so i would do but explain what yeah explain what you did and like also these were speakers so you got speakers to agree legit speakers to agree before you even had audience or anything yes which is the second thing i'm going to talk about is how to land a speaker but the the blog post i basically would just use forbes business insider all these places and just write a biography on the person but i would do it in an interesting way and eventually what happened is we would create infographics so um i had john who worked there and i would say john um here's the here's the bulleted points of their life turn it into an infographic please and that's what we did we had infographics it could have been a blog post which is what i used to do we this time we made infographics and it worked quite well and it was basically um i read the book made to stick and i just copied that so i took information about their company and i made it really easy to understand so for example pandora streams this amount of music per hour which is the equivalent of x y and z uh they the reason why they are able to do that as they were one of the first people to launch on the iphone um and then i like i just tell that story pretty simple i thought it was simple very effective now that's how we got our initial sales now the thing about sales for events it's incredibly stressful the reason it's stressful is typically 20 of your sales come in the first five to seven days and then 20 sometimes more 30 of your sales comes in the last like four or five days which means that dead time so you you want you have to get you got to kick ass right out of the right out of the gate so your first launch series you need to kick ass your first email launch series you need to do really well then there's a fair bit of dead time and it feels we're failing we're failing we're failing and then the last 10 days or so you get a wave of sales and it all comes down to the last minute and it is incredibly nerve-wracking and anything can ruin it for example a pandemic or if there was like a terrorist attack if there was um um um bad weather as simple as bad weather you're [ __ ] and so you've been working for seven weeks now eventually in our case a whole year on this event and you're screwed so it's very stressful but the way that you can actually make more money and this is a something that i didn't learn until later on for the tickets you actually want to charge higher than you than you can so let's say you want to make a hundred thousand dollars and you want to get a thousand people to pay you a hundred dollars you always charge 250. and then you give more you give discounts in order to get to 100 average sale price and so you want in my opinion you want to be very generous with discounts but you want to charge a lot of money so it anchors it at a high at a high value yeah correct and one other thing that you want to do is you want to run this like an ecom site so for an ecomp site you say well i want to make 100 grand this month therefore i need to get um um you know a hundred thousand people to my a hundred thousand high quality people on my website of which three percent are going to convert i know three percent are going to convert because i'm constantly tinkering with my landing page the average sale value is going to be x dollars therefore this is how you do it now i just need to get people to my website that's what a lot of conference people don't do that's what you should do um and it works quite well um and then finally time is one of the best ways to create sales so you have to give discounts early on uh and at the end and you in the goal is you want to have five three to five tiers of pricing so you want to have early early bird and then early bird and then middle bird and then you're late okay seriously this is the last reminder you're late like you because if you actually look so can you actually see um if you log into that doc i actually put a chart of my very first event uh from july of 24. you're gonna see big spikes every single one of those big spikes was a new ticket tier ending and there's a direct correlation between the amount of revenue that i made that day and the amount of like the tier ending and um me sending an email blast reminding people and i would email some two or three times a day in order to remind them wow and so so you were going to hack a news for traffic were you going anywhere else and is that where you would go today if you were doing it again well if i was doing a tech event if i was doing a tech event yes okay i would go to hacker news and what's the secret because a lot of people will say um like you know you know when i post on hacker news you know i get you know i know traffic i get down voted i get what you know i get removed because it's like well i would say the obvious or not the obvious but maybe obvious is well your content might suck um but i would say you i would actually write content or invite speakers who's who i knew i could write about that would go viral on hacker news and also if you post 10 times only three times it will go viral but those three times you'll get like on hacker news like 100 000 views and so that it's like a hits driven business so you got to post a ton actually for it to work and so you i remember when you were doing your events so okay go sixty thousand hundred thousand i remember you were basically like yeah hustle con brings in five hundred thousand dollars of revenue and like three hundred thousand of that is profit or even more sometimes you know if i recall correctly so is that typical that it was so profitable or were you doing something different than the average event host yeah so when we would uh towards the third fourth event we could easily make seven hundred thousand dollars i think maybe let's just say easily five hundred thousand i forget the exact but we're making seven figures a year from events and yeah we could do 50 margins but the margins get smaller as we actually grew and so it was actually more profitable to do some of these smaller events but we did a few things that made us profitable the first i paid i'm now i'll say it's against the contract but i'm going to say it i paid casey neistat money to speak at hustle con which is no surprise it's like you could just google speaking views but besides that i've had probably three four 500 people speak not once did i ever pay for another speaker not one time now what i think i did do a few times is i would pay for their flight but i would pay economy i had sam yeagen who's the ceo of match.com or was who's very wealthy i paid a 350 flight from chicago to san francisco and then maybe i think we got him a hotel but i think it was just a 350 flight and he actually we reimbursed him for that and he would email me to remind him oh you guys still owe me that 350. so we didn't pay for any speakers other than casey neistat the second i use a [ __ ] ton of volunteers because there's these kids and not necessarily kids but uh people who will email you once you have an event to volunteer there's a whole crew of them and they want to be around you and uh they do the work they do the work and it's fun for them it's a lot of fun to be part of something that we would schedule it so they could go see some talks but they didn't really even care about the talks they just wanted to be in the mix it was exciting for them and so these k these people love doing that i use volunteers for everything now the third part is actually important and this might get some flack but i would never work with or i would try my hardest to avoid union venues you want to avoid union venues and ticketmaster venues because if you work at a a lot of venues sign contracts with ticketmaster or something like that and you have to work with ticketmaster f that sorry ticketmaster you guys i don't want to work with you um and so the goal is to work within some place that isn't bogged down by that or bogged down by a union because there were some places where i would say all right i want my volunteers to be at the door and they would say nope you have to have our union guy do it we charge fifty dollars an hour you have to have tenants right yeah it's awesome so yeah so i remember you had the sickest venue in oakland um so right outside of san francisco and it's the oakland whatever the theater what's the theater called the parable theater this thing it looks so grand and i remember you were like dude guess how much this cost us i don't know if you could say but it was amazingly affordable like to rent like 10 or 15 grand 10 15 grand for the two days including all the people yeah yeah and um and so you know when you're doing an event that's bringing 700 grand like and you you needed a kind of like a notable nice big venue i thought that was i i thought that thing would be a hundred thousand dollars right like my wedding venue cost that much you know and it was like right just for me to get married it wasn't even like a business you know it wasn't like you couldn't host things and there's a few things which is we i preferred hosting conferences in places that typically aren't used to hosting conferences so i would do it there i did at the brava theater in san francisco which i think i don't remember exactly i'm pretty sure that was three thousand dollars to host an event there and i made a hundred grand there right so i would do it in venues that typically weren't meant for conferences and the reason why is if you go to a hotel or if you go to a conference center they're gonna charge you for the union stuff which is gonna add up really fast which is actually going to be probably 2x the price of the hard cost of the venue and they're going to charge you something like 50 ahead for meals because you have to use their caterer and that's something i would avoid like crazy instead i would find local mom-and-pop places and i would call them and i would say uh eight dollars a meal i need them prepped and ready to roll in in a box can you do that right um and i would get loads of cool people to do that now the thing is is that in my opinion the food not really that important when it comes to a conference some people will debate me and say oh it's actually really important i got the cheapest [ __ ] i possibly could and i thought it was fun enough and then that morning or that night or the night before we would go to costco and we would buy every single danish that they had and we would rent a truck and bring it there and that's how we did stuff i did it on uh really cheaply you don't always have to do that but if you want to make a lot of profit early on in your career it's a great way to do it you also had vendors that were like uh like i make a keto breakfast bar you're like great you're providing breakfast for everybody you know that's your you're paying me for marketing and you're giving away free goods to my you know oh you make vitamin water or whatever like some you're the you're the startup that wants to be the next vitamin water well you need to be here and now that's the third that's the fourth point which is the way to make money is you get stuff for free so usually when i or when i first started i only typically had revenue from ticket sales that's actually foolish as you grow usually 50 50 ticket and sponsors is your revenue early on i didn't charge people that much in sponsor money instead anyone that emailed me that had free stuff uh they would say hey we want to sponsor you or i would email people and say hey instead of sponsoring us just bring your stuff i've got 300 great people who are going to be there will you come and bring 600 bottles of vitamin water or whatever it is and they would say absolutely i'm there and i would say awesome i'm not charging you any money i just want you to provide free stuff right and people did that we got someone to pay 17 000 for the lunches because all they did was hand out free stuff and they would just get a little bit of business from it and it would be worth it so we got tons and tons and tons of free stuff right so the point of i actually didn't provide anything um and that is actually quite effective and then a few more points um a lot of times your sponsorship money is going to come in the second year because the first year you want to just invite the sponsors there and they're going to see that it provides value and that you're the real deal and you'll follow through and they'll sponsor you the second year you have to sell the second year sponsorships and sometimes the second your tickets immediately like the day of or or 24 hours after when you're in the heat of the moment and they're seeing everything wow this is great oh people are loving us next year are you in title sponsorship exactly and you want to do that right away and the big guys like the intuits and the microsoft's of the world everyone's coming out they'll plan that cycle two years out right so you can actually book your two three four sometimes it's it's that crazy and you could get hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars from them right um and so if you're gonna just so don't worry about getting not getting sponsors the first time you'll get them uh the second time if you do well and finally a few points on speakers so for content i didn't pay anyone but what i would do is i would try to land the i would put all my work in early on to get the biggest speaker i possibly could right away right for example i convinced the founder of pandora tim westergen to speak and he was one of the first people i had the truth is i kind of lied about who else was coming i said all these people were all these other people were coming to speak none of them had had actually committed but once tim said yes then i went to all those other people and i told him tim was coming and they again said yes and it was way easier to land bigger name speakers because i got the whale anchor yeah so so and you've actually published your cold emails that you sent to speakers i think on either your blog or neville's blog so if people search what do they search for to go find those i've i've copy pasted those many times already uh because i'm like this is great how sam did this yeah just um sam parr neville cold emailing yeah uh the the and you'll see it and that stuff worked well and i don't want to hear this nonsense if you're starting this if you're gonna start an event well you already knew everyone uh no i know everyone because i hosted the of these events that's why i have a huge network not because uh i had them before i started this event yeah um and so i think so uh i think what you just said is like a mountain of gold i think people would pay you thousands of dollars to hear that how do you do this uh you know as a consultant or a course or something like that i think you you you gave them the goods for free on this pod which i think is amazing and that's what we're all about the other thing i would say is i think there's it's not just about making money doing this the way i look at this if i'm if i'm 22 years old and i don't want to have like the traditional career this is how you bring luck to yourself you go host the party you go host to host the event that's how sam built his world-class network that's how sam made a bunch of friends that's how we met you know like that's that's how these things happen you bring luck to you by going and taking a bunch of action and all you have to do is be the hustler who connects a bunch of dots and do it in a topic area that you're interested in so if you're super interested in like biohacking then you create the biohacker cons conference you don't need to know anyone you just go figure out who are all the biohackers that i need to speak here how do i get in front of biohackers while i need to create content about you know biohacking and i need to get that in front of people using reddit or hacker news or some other source i need to collect emails then i need to keep telling great stories and at the end of each of those stories i need to say hey if you like this kind of stuff there's a thousand people like you including these big names at this event come you know like buy your ticket now to join i think you 100 should do that and i think if you're going to do it start planning now and it will change your life um and it's actually not that hard yeah now last thing i'll wrap up with this we've had ryan beagleman on the podcast i actually did you see that email i said that one so in 2017 i called people who worked at ryan's company ryan's company was i mean i guess it was the other way around my company was basically ryan beagleman's company for tech and business and entrepreneurship new news uh ryan beagleman ran this thing and started this thing called biz now media which was basically what my company is for real estate hustle but for real estate and so they did about 18 million dollars in revenue the year they sold which they sold for about 50 60 million dollars 75 employees their revenue was made up a third from media so a third from advertising a third from an event ticket sales a third from sponsorships the average revenue per event uh team member was around three hundred thousand dollars they did 250 events around the year before they sold with the average ticket price being eighty thousand uh eighty dollars and they wouldn't do an event unless they could make eight uh ten thousand dollars in revenue most of the venues that they got were free and a lot of times programming was very short so an event would start at 7am it would kick off for an hour of breakfast schmoozing followed by a 90-minute session for panels and discussion and then hanging out and talking and then you'd be back in your office by 10 30. and it was very effective and that's my final point about events which is uh the content actually not that important all the speakers do and all the content that you're you're going to have all it does is it brings the a particular like-minded person and the value is from that people or those people being there and the content is basically just a way to as marketing to get the right people and the way you know that that's true if you go on youtube you can go watch all this talks from hustlecon like all the years they're all on youtube and they'll have like 2 000 views 3 000 views you would think oh if people are coming to hear these great speakers they're willing to fly and pay you know basically it's a thousand dollars all in to go have this experience if you're up from out of out of town um which i think a lot of people are then wow you know 10 times more people should be just consuming the content for free from the comfort of their own home no it's not what happens people don't actually take the like it's just like same thing with coursera they have harvard's all of harvard's courses online if you want the harvard education you can go get it for free right now online turns out people don't want the harvard education they want the harvard label in the same way people don't want the content from hustlecon they want the experience and the network and the kind of serendipity that can happen by going out there and getting amongst it with a bunch of other people and like putting yourself in that position people that's really the value that you get uh oh sorry that's what i should say that's the value you're providing to the person who's deciding to come don't fool yourself into thinking they're coming to hear this mind-blowing content although there is this like sharad you put up where you say that's why you're coming and they say that's why they're going but that's not really what you get out of it that is that is absolutely correct and uh i'm showing i i actually if you put this thing or you pull this thing up sean called i don't really want to share this publicly but you can look at it it's called event metrics all time i've listed 46 events that we've done uh and i list out how many people showed up how much revenue came from tickets and how much revenue came from sponsorships there's this one event series that we came up with called 2x it stands for like two x chromosomes meaning women have two x chromosomes and it was a evening event that we would host from nine pm until uh i don't know uh whenever it ended or sorry seven pm to nine p.m and we would get a sponsor to pay for it and we would invite these people to come the first one had 400 people i'm pretty sure towards the end um we would get a thousand people so here's one this one had 982 people coming we did 24 000 in revenue seven thousand dollars in sponsors thirty one thousand dollars in uh total revenue and then it looks like sixteen thousand dollars in cost frankly we probably didn't even need to spend that much uh and we made fifteen grand in profit and then we would host that almost monthly in a variety of cities we would do la chicago yada yada yada one night it could make you 15 grand do that 12 times a year then you launch a paid community on top of that you got yourself a multi-million dollar business inside 18 months if you just rinse and repeat this it works very well while building a great network um and being kind of the hub in between all these different people the downside of course is that event planning [ __ ] sucks events are stressful and um like you know it takes years off my life every time i have to do an event so i hate events but i love this business model i love that you laid it out for the person who gets energy and like wants to do this right like for me the nightmare job would be wedding planner um but for some people they dream of being a wedding planner and so for people who find that fun they like that version of stress that flavor of stress i think you just laid out a pretty amazing playbook uh okay yes uh hopefully it's a good plan uh someone can go do it and by the way if you just google the hustle 2x literally like the number two and then the word and then the letter x i think what's it say we did we did uh in 2018 from that event series which is just i think we only want we did about 200 000 in revenue and 110 000 in profit in 12 months from launch to the first year it's pretty good anyway that's that that's that's information on paid events do you want to do one idea before we go uh i'm kind of excited about this yeah so yeah okay have you heard of this company future fitness future fit yes i have tried it i was i i tried it i was one of the i think i was one of their early users and they did a good job of onboarding me hand on boarding me you know nicely but the product didn't stick with me well so i don't know exactly how it ended up being but when i first signed up it wasn't that unique but it was slick it was just you have a personal trainer so i pay them 100 a month a personal trainer made a plan for me and i would tell them what sports i cared about what i want to be good at and i would talk to them i think weekly about my athletic or about my progress that's what it was when i first signed up but it was all tracked via a watch and they would send you an apple watch yeah so okay so i think i think it's evolved a little bit so basically what future fit is is it's your it's a personal trainer it's really like an accountability coach and that's what i'll call this bucket of ideas i want to brainstorm within uh of accountability coaching so futurefit basically says hey okay a personal trainer is like 100 per session you know so so let's say it's 150 per session in in big cities like new york or sf and then you know a gym membership is like 15 a month right so you have this like big discrepancy there where one is like one session is over a hundred dollars the other one a whole month is fifteen 15 but then there's something in between what these guys did was they said well look for 150 a month you're going to get a fitness coach and they're not going to come you know they're not going to be with you you know like sort of spotting you while you do your bench press they're going to be spotting the accountability of you actually working out so what they would do they would ask you about your goals then they would send you a customized workout plan based on your goals and in reality they just have a huge library of workouts it's like oh guys you want to build muscle here's a bunch of workouts to choose from you know a woman who wants to have tone but okay you know here's a bunch of workouts to to use so the trainer sends you a workout that's you know for you based on your goals and then they'll kind of text you and be like hey did you get that workout in and they also connect to apple watch so they can kind of see if you did it and they can say hey great job or they can be like hey what's up man like don't don't let go of the rope like keep keep going like we said we wanted to do this keep keep doing this and so i think this is a very smart idea and a very smart business model which is basically the core thing that stops most people from being fit is the habit of fitness the habit of exercise yes if you work out with a trainer you can get more out of every workout but for most people the bigger problem is just sticking to the workout like schedule and routine and actually like not just feeling lazy and not going to the gym you know and so i like that they have basically accountability is the primary feature of this app and so i like that there is knowledge there is tech technique but it's packaged around accountability so i was talking to ben and my right-hand man ben and he was like you just had a kid i'll say how's it going how's baby life you know you getting any sleep he's like actually we hired a sleep coach same model woman woman in texas and she basically what's it called so she's just like an independent person there's not even like a service so we talked before about patel which is like my friend damian who's starting this company to do this so he just used you know somebody he found that's like known to do this in texas and so he just said uh great like you know here's kind of what we're doing today like here's my here's my current like routine you know we'd like to be getting some sleep and here's my rough schedule here's my wife's you know rough schedule so we'd like to make it work we don't want to have the baby cry it out so that's like our constraints so they you know your coach basically downloads your goals and your kind of like your limitations your constraints i said great i got a program for you and i was like oh wow what's her technique he's like honestly it's like not that much he's like you know just he needs snap at this time specifically and like during these times he needs to stay awake so make sure you're playing with him or you're feeding him you're doing something then don't let him fall asleep and then like at this time you're gonna put him to bed every single night and like you know when he cries you're gonna go in for this many minutes and whatever it's like a little bit of a coaching on the technique but he's like honestly it's not the technique he's like it's just the accountability of like she asks us okay what time did he nap what time did he wake up today what time how did he sleep last night and because we keep having to report to this lady it forces us to not like throw in the towel and just be like oh man like i don't know i give up just let him sleep if you want to sleep right now it's like no our coach told us he needs to stay awake during these daytime hours so that he's going to sleep well at night he's like dude it's amazing he's now sleeping eight hours a night he's two months old like life like the first month was so rough and the second month is so much better just with this coach he's like and it's not even like anything that we couldn't have just googled a schedule he's like it's how having this woman who we're accountable to to maintain the schedule is much more important than like just taking a schedule off the internet of a in the same way like you can go download a workout off the internet but this coach helps you stay accountable to actually doing those workouts so i thought so okay yeah let's break this down a little bit let's talk about what this could work so i actually use a service called uh do you have your phone on you yeah okay go to my mybodytutor.com my body tutor like a tutor like a like a you know like a coach tutor right look at that website how ugly is that oh my gosh so i'm on a 1990 i'll just describe this i'm on what looks like a 1990s website it says at the very top it's like this awful logo and then it says celebrating 2007 to 2021 14 years so that you know this has been around for a while it looks like it's 2007. yeah and so what it is it's a guy named adam gilbert and he's got a variety of people who are on the um on the payroll and you pay i was paying 500 a month and all i would do it was very simple i would every time i ate a meal i would take a picture and he would comment on it once a week i would do a 20 or 10 minute phone call and they would say how's it going and the stress that knowing i was being watched right made me change my habits and i got and i lost weight it's almost like when you're writing in a google doc that stress makes you do it that's what this is right when you see somebody else's cursor there okay so so i just started using one because i was like oh when when you told me about this i started looking into like okay where else could you do this and i thought well it's anywhere you have a goal and that the goal like it's not that you need like some specific strategy that no one's ever heard of it's like no you kind of even know what to do it's just helpful to have somebody who's on your side in your corner supporting you and keeping you focused keeping you on track and so productivity i think is a big one so uh you're probably like me you know you have like goals for what you want to do and probably everybody listening to this is like you know i want to make five more sales this month i want to get five new clients or i want to grow 20 this month or i want to like grow my email list to 5 000 people or whatever it doesn't matter what your goal is you have a goal i want to get promoted um so you have a goal and then like your progress is basically like sometimes you need tactical help like strategic advice but really what i what i've found for myself is that you just need pressure i need accountability i need to make each day count and if i just get like you know like 25 out of the 30 days a month to count i'm gonna actually hit my goals but if i'm like uh i kind of had an off day there i was distracted i went down this rabbit hole of doing this other thing oh i got stressed out or you know like whatever if i lose four of those days of like i didn't actually like make the most of that day now i'm down to like 20 days out of the 30 and i'm like i'm off track i didn't get my goal and like what's that difference of like staying on track towards your thing and and off is like for me it's accountability it's why i work well with a co-founder because a co-founder helps you like every day you're kind of focused on all right what do i need to do today do i get it done at the end of the day did i like make enough progress or not like that sort of thing and so i found this service so you can do this actually if you want uh anybody who's listening to this so you can basically go and um it's called what's called we focus and it's basically you and your coach and it helps you focus on getting to your goals uh for your professional goals so anything you want to do with your work or your projects and so you just text this number right it's like i'll put in the description it's four three four four three four five oh five four seven six nine i'll put it in the comments but basically it's uh four three four five oh five grow is the kind of like the handle of it and you pay 150 bucks a month and you basically get a coach and the coach basically just texts you like at first it's like all right what's your goals for the month all right it's uh it's april what would make for a great april and honestly just that question is actually pretty powerful because you got to like articulate it you say something but then you realize like oh i want to really make progress on my book well what does make progress mean like you want to have a draft that's like 100 pages would that be the goal and so they help you like actually set a good goal and then on a day-to-day basis they sort of like it's kind of like the manager you need it's like they kind of nag you enough to make you get it done but they're not annoying this is and and this is wefocus.com there's no app there's no there's no website there's no app no it's just a phone number it's literally just a phone number and so they they have these like coaches wow okay so i can't do it my friend was using it and so so i was like okay what's the number so you just gave me four three four five oh five four seven six nine and so anyways uh they have like a wait list i think but you i got let in recently so so basically you pay 150 bucks and then what happens is the coach will basically say in the morning they'll be like all right great like we said your goal was let's say to you know grow revenue by 20 this month and you said you're going to do that by like ramping up your sales efforts so it's like all right cool hey hey you know it'll be like hey sam like um like let's get it today like you know what what would make today a great day like how what would be really satisfying at the end of the day if you've done what and you're like i want to make like 10 10 sales calls like all right great and then like in the evening or the afternoon they'll check in they'll be like you know like remember keep you know keep the vision in mind we want to get there like go for it make sure you get those 10 in today at the end of the day they'll still text you something they'll be like you know hey did you get the 10 calls in you know if not you know what do you think held you up today let's reflect on it or if you got it it's like awesome like you know high five plus like think back to one of those calls where you really kicked ass like like what made it kick ass and so it just helps you and you can put in as much or as little as you want so if you just want it to be like just check in with me once a day or once a week it'll do that but if you want it to be like more reflective like i like it where it's like all right let me let me think back on my day like what's something i could have done better today so i actually disagree with you strongly on this one this is far too broad i would want to make it incredibly narrow so for example uh we guarantee you're going to be a better writer or sorry the service to make you write more right and you have to log in every day and if you don't get a thousand words you get um you get your coach yells at you like dude what the [ __ ] do you even want do you really actually want to be a good writer because you're not writing um and so i actually would make it far more vertical specific for yes so relationship i think could really actually work you know what i would do another one i would just call it gratitude right i'm going to make you happier by so hey you're going to probably yeah why didn't you write here what you were thankful for this morning what the hell um you could show gratitude um what else we said you said relationships i actually don't know how you would do a relationship one well i think i think i think for relationships it's like you know people think relationship is when people say they need they want a better relationship what they're really saying is uh [ __ ] my partner does these things and it annoys me why don't they just not do those things and not annoy me and in reality to make a better relationships like you need to be the best version of yourself in the relationship and if your partner agrees to do the same for themselves like you'll have an amazing relationship over time and so so what you would do for relationships is you would basically say awesome what is the best version of you you're going to bring to your relationship and it would just coach you on you doing your part and not doing tit-for-tat measuring oh i'll behave if my i'll be great if they are great it's like well that's a recipe for failure uh it's i'll be great because that's who i am that's what works and in the context of being a great boyfriend great girlfriend great husband whatever okay so that could work for relationships so we've uh diet and fitness is easy i think that's easy yeah you know you have to run you have to hit this mileage anywhere you have a goal so it could be like as narrow as people who are training for a triathlon that i know a lot of people hire like a marathon our marathon coach who helps them like structure their ramp up running and all that stuff so it could be as narrow as any it's anything you have a goal on so the reason i like this one is because my i have like goals when it comes to work right and i know that if i can just if i can be a little bit more productive every single day if i can be a little bit better at my projects make a little more progress every day 150 in a month is like nothing compared to the value i create by actually doing better in my project so it's anywhere you have a goal fitness diet relationships um and so you know whatever those goals are for people i think that accountability coaching is going to be a bigger thing because it's like anywhere that there's a like so for example relationships you have a relationship therapist or a couple's therapy right so you have this thing you could go pay 150 an hour or you could read a 10 book well now there's something in the middle it's like a human on the other side but you don't have to pay 150 an hour you pay 100 a month because they're digital and they're managing multiple clients this way in a light touch model same thing with fitness you could have a personal trainer or you could have a gym membership or this is the thing in the middle of your accountability coach so same thing with you know work you could have an executive coach who's like you know thousands of dollars as you're as your ceo coach uh or whatever your job is if you're not a ceo but you have an executive coach or you could really read a management book well this is something in the middle it's a way for you to be better at work with accountability coach so that's the model i see here and i bet there's a bunch of areas where this could apply um how big do you think future fit is so future fit says that they're they're trying to get to a thousand coaches this year they've raised 35 million dollars uh um series b so i think they're you know they're probably doing fairly well and they're kind of in that peloton model right they just need like you know if you're making 150 subscription per month it doesn't take that much to be at 15 million dollars you know a year of of revenue doesn't take that much to be a 150 million dollars a year like it is an achieve these are achievable numbers as you get to like 10 000 subscribers a hundred thousand subscribers type of thing i don't know what they're supposed to so the issue is churn though the issue is of course churn yeah because and i think that's why the harder the goal um the more the churn this is the unfortunate part of this business is like fitness people fall off that horse and even if your product is great sometimes they just stop wanting to work out eat right you know so i think diet is going to have a lot of turn i think fitness can have a lot of churn um work i think we'll have a little bit less turn but maybe you know still will have churn uh relationships i don't know where that would fall but i don't know i find this pretty fascinating so and i i i i i'm trying it for a few days i like it have you invested in future fit no i invested in fitness ai which is an ai version of it i wouldn't invest in future fit because of the churn that was that would be something i would be concerned about um but i would love to own one of these companies yeah totally i for sure would like to own it um do we want to do one more no i gotta run um all right well dude by the way do you know that we get criticized for irish goodbyes we just end the podcast it's our thing i actually do the same thing with my family too like if i'm talking to my mom or my sister like there's no like okay well you know i'm gonna go run to the store now so it's been great chatting no it's like gotta go bike or i'll just be like bye and i'll just hang up the phone yeah i do the exact same thing whatever they know the deal and they can do the same right back to me you don't even need to tell me why you need to leave if you need to leave you just yell by and you hang up before i reply i do this at gatherings too i don't i actually don't say goodbye i just walk out um yeah i do that too because i think it's i think goodbyes are pointless like what's the point it's just like i don't know it's just a lot of effort for something that's uncomfortable for me to do and like uh yeah once i've decided i'm moving on to my next activity like i've moved on already it's too late i'm here i'm there i'm not here anymore i'm gone right like i gave you the beginning in the middle i don't need an n the ending's stupid you just need the it's it's pointless um all right so that's the end of the podcast i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back

Bradley Jacobs has had hit after hit since his early 20s. Bradley has started companies in the oil, waste management, machine rental, and trucking industries and they've all been wildly successful. We break down how he's able to do it.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
so the guy i'm gonna talk about today his name is brad jacobs bradley jacobs i think he goes by but uh we're gonna call brad jacobs and this person is super interesting because they have started uh five companies that have either gone public or are worth over a billion dollars he started age 23 he's 64 now uh google them brad jacobs he's worth somewhere in the range of three four five billion dollars and he's bought or in both he doesn't like invest passively like a venture check they buy companies and he's bought something like six 700 companies and he's done it across a variety of industries and he's done the same strategy over and over and over again in different industries and it's incredibly interesting and this guy uh is very fascinating to me for a variety of reasons that i'm going to explain but andrew have you heard of this guy brad jacobs do you know anything about this ever i don't know anything that's kind of why he's cool he's kind of on the under the radar if you google him he's uh he's got like a bald head and he looks like a finance guy because he wears a tie and he's like pretty um well spoken and you think that he's just like a private equity person and i guess maybe he is but he's really an entrepreneur he's very entrepreneurial and he's uh far more interesting than just a lot of the typical new york hedge funny type of folks and so i'm gonna give you a quick story about his background so he's started five things that have been quite meaningfully sized so the first was uh it was called amorex oil associates he started it when he was 23 and it was an oil biz it was basically like an oil brokerage firm which uh i'm not entirely sure what that entails but i imagine it just means uh connecting folks who created the oil to large businesses who are buying the oil and within a very short amount of time only about four years uh remember he started this when he was 23 so by the age of 27 amorex his oil business was doing 4.7 billion dollars in gross uh gross oil bookings meaning he would that's how much oil they're buying and uh and selling now i imagine his company kept a tiny percent of that like one or two or three percent but incredibly impressive for a young guy um and after a few years he sells that business for a billion dollars then only a couple months after that he starts this thing called hamilton resource uh hamilton resource he starts out of uh uh england he convinces a french bank to give him a billion dollars line of credit which he was quite successful already even though he was crazy young but uh he made it happen and he went and secured a line of credit and here's what he said he goes we moved physical cargos of oil from one place to another the 80s turned out to be a great time in the oil business and i built hamilton up to about a billion dollars in revenues and did business in dozens of countries uh dozens of countries before i moved back to the states in 1989. so between 83 and 89 he started this business and it also was huge i believe he ended up selling it for a billion dollar north of a billion dollars so that's business number two business number three a little bit of a of an odd one was waste management um i don't think there's anyone out there doing waste management stuff now that's brand new but there's a ton of companies that at the time started in the 70s 80s and 90s like waste management the company waste management and what they did was they would go out and find tons of mom and pop waste management companies because back then that's how it was it probably is a little bit to this day but he started this thing called united waste management which eventually became the fifth largest solid waste business in america and it had a very very very simple business plan which was buy landfills and small markets by many of the local trucking companies that were serving those markets optimize the truck routes maximize the pricings get margins up achieve size so that they had the capability to scale and they did that and the strategy worked really well and in just five years our earnings compounded annually annually by 55 percent and the and he took the company public something like eight months after starting it and the stock price went up as well 50 every single year for like five years eventually that company grew to 3.9 billion dollars in revenue and 1.2 billion dollars in ebitda with 750 locations and 13 000 employees is this freaking crazy oh sorry that i just gave you the numbers i gave you the numbers for um his next business but the waste management grew to 2.5 billion dollars in revenue oh sorry uh 2.5 billion dollars and an exit to waste management nuts right that's crazy so i i one of the most interesting things about this is like there i always think there's like um four different types of entrepreneurs right there's the innovators so let's just take let's take um chipotle as an example right so there's the innovator there's the guy who rolled the first burrito and was like oh this tastes really good um then there's the remixer there's the person who creates chipotle they take the burrito they package it up they create a brand around it then there's the scalers the person who scales chipotle to 100 locations and then there's the optimizer the person who just sits on top makes sure it doesn't blow up and gets as much as possible gets as much juice out of the lemon as they can and this guy's a great example of a scaler someone who just takes something that already works that's already proven and just does a much better job of it and rolls it out makes it scalable and builds something massive and it's super it's super interesting because i'd say i i kind of fall into this camp at the same time i feel like what's sexy about this guy is actually how boring the businesses are right they're they're so basic these are things that are like undisruptible and when you build them it's like a hundred year business or something which i think is really cool whereas what we do is like five you got to think in five year uh chunks i completely agree and if you scroll up to this document that we have open and you click source um the source that i'm using for a lot of this and this is so interesting um so we're on business number three i'll get to four and five in a second but when what this guy does and then when i wrap up all five i'll explain to you what my lessons uh learn from this guy are but i'll say one of them right now which is what this guy does is he raises money like a madman and it's not like a ridiculous amount i mean saying you're raising tens of millions of dollars i guess for the for the average show yeah that is a ridiculous amount but he's got a track record and he turns him into multi-billion dollar things but uh so so kind of tens of millions of dollars is not that much money um but if you click that source thing what what does that take you to to the sec okay i found this file on the sec and i don't really know what this is but i don't even remember how i came across it but this is what interested me it's a q a session of him having written it out and he basically lays out the strategy of his fourth and fifth business and so what this appears to be is a q a that he prepared and they showed this to a ton of potential investors a ton of potential banks and they decide to invest in him and i think this was before the company even started is that what that is so you're saying this is what he raised on like there's no deck there's nothing it's just this is the thing he goes out and he says read this document and you can invest i'm not entirely sure but i think that is part of it it's called this is called a schedule 14a which i i'm not an expert in the sec i believe that is something that you have to answer before a board of directors at a publicly traded company um raises money but i'm not entirely sure but it's interesting though because he writes in wonderful straightforward simple english and you could read his entire strategy which i'm going to go through in a second um but skim that while i bring well i i'll summarize the next two businesses that he did so he started um i told you he started two oil things but basically those were oil brokerage businesses then he started um well waste management business now his fourth one is called united rentals now i don't know if you see this in canada but if you pay attention to this now and if you're listening to this and you live in america go on a drive in downtown the downtown city wherever you live and look at the big box trucks and look at the rental equipment so look at um like the caterpillars or the bobcats or the the um the construction equipment as well as the um porta potties and anything involving construction or trucking go and look at those things and i guarantee you on a lot of them you're gonna see united rentals well that is the fourth company that he started and he started it with the idea of the same thing of waste management he wanted to go out and he wanted to find a massive industry that was highly segmented by small businesses where that were profitable and great but they didn't have enough capital to grow and they were kind of bad at sales and that's what he did and so he founded it and in just five years five years it grew to 4 billion in revenue and 1.2 billion in ebitda is he growing via acquisition or is he just rolling this out and crushing competition across the country we're going to talk about that but what he said was we got there partly through acquisitions partly through organic growth developed by developing greenfield locations um he goes we grew by using the same strategy at united ways we bought about two thirds of the branch locations and cold started another third from scratch i actually prefer cold starts is what he said the business plan for united rentals was to become the largest equipment rental company in the world and leverage our purchasing power branding and other advantages of size within 13 months we became number one leap frogging fleet frogging hertz which had become the equipment rental which was the number one equipment rental business in 1965. another thing we did was we went fast uh we went public fast we formed the company on labor day weekend and we were trading on the new york stock exchange by december labor day weekend is in may i think right so they started the company in may and five months is that five six seven months that seven months later they were public merrill lynch said it was the fastest growing or the fastest ipo they've ever seen and i stepped down uh uh and so he stepped down of united rentals in 2007. this is only five years after starting and to start the next company but when he stepped down united rentals if you look it up now i believe their market cap is 25 billion dollars so he spent five years on this company and it's worth 25 billion dollars crazy so listen to what he did after this um after i stepped down i began looking for my next big thing i studied tons of industries and i ended up concentrating on transportation and logistics it's larger and more fragmented than the industries i've been i've previously been involved in it's a 13 billion dollar um sorry a 13 trillion dollar industry and here's what this guy says this guy at the time is already multi-billionaire but let me see if i um i have he wrote out what he does which was basically he basically spends three months he reads tons of reports and then he calls a hundred experts in each industry and he just goes and he sits down with them and just asks them questions it might as well be a podcast all that's like exactly how he learned so he's this multi-billionaire he's his big shot he's done all this amazing stuff and he calls these people and he just sits down and he listens that's all he does it's pretty amazing and he did this and then he's in this with his new thing it's called xpo logist logistics have you heard of this i have i have heard of this i think it's a delivery and logistics company like a competitor to fedex at least that's my understanding well we'll put this in the show notes but in that document up top that is the document from where he was raising money for xpeo logistics and then plain and it looks like it looks like it's like supply chain so it's like getting people things they need that are critical on time well in there he um in that document that i sent to you he i didn't i i couldn't study the whole thing but in plain english he explains kind of what they did and his reasoning for getting into it and he just says well i just studied loads of industries this one seemed industry interesting i went and um interviewed a hundred people who were experts on it i hired really good people and we're gonna do x y and z and that x y and z is exactly what he's done in his uh last uh businesses and now i wanna wrap up by by giving you guys incredibly detailed um stats or uh incredibly detailed strategy on what he does so his first thing that he does he looks for huge industries with lots of fragmentation that are small and profitable but don't have the capital to uh to scale so here's what he says he was in a nutshell this is how you ramp up a business you buy a brokerage or some type of small business with 30 million in revenue and you add 30 to 40 bodies to it and you double revenue in time i've looked into companies that have executed this plan but most of them don't have the capital to sustain it i try to find those businesses and i bring all the capital to do it the second thing that he does is he hires salespeople so he says i like to hire hungry talented salespeople at a low base but big upside for incentives i fund their training for a few months and it's not that hard for the winners to build a million dollar book after a year or so um it's a business where you have to make 99 calls a day and do one or two deals so you have to hire people who are psycho i actually don't know this word what's this we have to hire people who are psycho chromatically test high on the need to win scale and low on the need to be liked scale a sales person will have a base of 25 000 or 35 000 but can make many times that amount through an incentivize a really good incentive program once you get the right people in the system and integrate them on the right i.t it can be really powerful and finally speaking of i.t when someone asked him what was the best acquisition of all time they ever made he said they made a powerful software acquisition with a politically incorrect name called rental man and we used that to integrate all of our rental businesses we rolled up into that company we couldn't have made the hundreds of acquisitions we did without rental man and that was his best acquisition of all time and that my friend is brad jacobs and i can go on i i like i both love and and um find these guys kind of mysterious and i kind of wonder like what the thing that's missing in all this is like what keeps him going what's his purpose how do you how does he use his money and and like why does he do this right what's the driving force i researched him and the guy looks like a wall street stiff did you look up what he looks like yeah he looks kind of like um there's like a character actor that he looks like i'll try and find a photo of him like a generic nerdy like steve ballmer looking kind of guy yeah he looks like he would be like in biden or trump's cabinet uh yeah yeah but i've actually seen interviews with him he's very endearing and i think that he's not actually just a stiff like wall street like just milk all the numbers out i actually think that he um just this is his bill this is his urge he just loves to build and and and he constantly talks about integrity he goes the common denominator of everything we buy is the people who we buy from have to have high integrity and also one of our moats is we take care of the people of the businesses who work for the businesses that we're inheriting in fact the biggest risk of our plan is that the people who we buy companies from they leave and so we treat them all really really well and so i don't think this is actually because when i got his energy from interviews i actually believed that he was a good dude and this is just his art what do you think though what do you think he does with his money is that kind of public does he do any philanthropy or or anything because i always find it so interesting i mean there's two ways to look at like doing good in the world it's like okay you do capitalism right you employ a whole bunch of people you make an industry more efficient you add to global gdp you know good things happen because he does this right but on the flip side like what's driving making more money and maybe it is just continually maniacally going industry by industry and improving them and optimizing them that's his like gift or whatever but um but the guy i'm going to talk about next is really interesting because he basically uses all his money to do crazy good things right which is really fascinating i'll talk about him in a minute but do you have any sense of what this guy does like no with his money like does he like he's very much jets like i i don't i cannot figure it out but i will i can wrap this up by saying there's a few things that i've learned from this person the first is like taking the red pill which is like have you heard i i don't know someone just used that phrase to me their day and and i'm picking it up you should be careful it's uh associated with all sorts of not so uh not so positive connotations oh well i didn't know that what i mean is like i guess his perspective like when you look at what this person is capable of doing you think or when you read what he's done if you didn't know it was true you would say well that's impossible no one can do that but the person has done it repeatedly over and over and over again and he seems pretty nonchalant about that and so my what i'm learning from him is that um you can create these amazing things and it's hard but maybe could be kind of simple well it's so inspiring right you basically go find an industry that has let's look at the restaurant and industry in general right restaurants are disorganized they're very difficult businesses they're very low margin people have done this essentially in restaurants by building fast food chains right so you go in you build systems you do training you incentivize people the right way and you can make a lot of money doing that but you can't make a lot of money usually in an individual restaurant so what he's done is he's gone out and fun he finds these fragmented disorganized industries like you know waste management or logistics and he goes okay i'm gonna do the fast food chain uh except for that industry it's yeah and and it's really really cool um the second thing that that i learned is he actually does the same thing as you well i actually don't know your numbers but i bet you they're similar he likes to buy companies between five and ten times earnings um and that's like his number um that's what i mean yeah i'd say i love to buy businesses for that um that valuation or whatever um but the problem the problem with buying a business at that valuation is like you're buying kind of a crappy business often if it's going to be that low well these are trash what he's doing yeah exactly what he's doing is kind of building a platform where he's like i just need one so i can build the systems and then i can go and acquire a whole bunch more and the final thing and then we can move on is the guy loves debt and oftentimes that ends bad but i personally have zero debt in my life and i've never really had debt and i actually think though that not having debt or not having some type of leverage is silly and i've read articles about him and he talks about it very unemotionally like he seems like a really charismatic emotional guy but he's like yeah look like this makes total sense because i can grow this business at 30 percent uh therefore the cost if i look at the cost of capital i should allocate capital this and it just makes sense and i hear that i'm like yeah everything you're saying makes total sense i'm just so fearful and it's really cool that you don't seem to have that fear and i think that's interesting yeah and i think debt that's it goes back to like not having fatal potential potential blow-ups in your life right so i've heard everything from like you know i was talking to a guy and he was saying i'm super rich guy and he goes i've paid off my house in full i never have a mortgage or whatever and it just gives him that sense of security maybe this guy has he's so rich he's already made a whole bunch of money on other stuff that he can take a little more risk or he knows how to structure debt or whatever it is um you hear both things and the problem is you only hear the stories about the guys who levered up and did really well there may be a whole bunch of other brad jacob types who went out levered up and it totally them they hit a speed bump oh yeah lost all that money so the interesting thing about this though um the and the difference between what we do in this guy is this guy's essentially starting a new business um and what we like to do is find a business that's already working where we can actually just leave it and make it you know maybe we'll help plug in a new ceo or something like that but we're actually not messing with it we're not changing the dna this guy's like modifying the dna he's doing like crispr on these businesses he's working and warping them and turning that he's working really hard right so i don't like to work hard i get really excited when i hear about people like this i'm so glad they exist but i'm like oh my god this is a big lift i don't want to do it it's a big lift but it does seem cool it's cool uh it's this is like cornrows or sleeve tattoos i think they're cool i just don't want it they're cool for certain people and it works great for them exactly tattoos not for me too it's pretty sick that someone else has it but i don't know if i want it totally totally um and i i i think again going back to like this guy does make the world better because he employs a lot of people in industries where you know people aren't getting laid off because of this guy right because he's managed this business better he can probably pay people better give them more opportunity he's not going to lay them off because he's got this global business so it's very it's very positive but what i would want to understand is what's the guy do with the money what's driving him like is he like a sad empty hole where he's like i have to keep doing this all the time or is he like you know donating it all to charity or views this as super philanthropic in and of itself i'm super curious about that um i don't know i i like the only thing that i saw is that he has a good glass door rating um which i actually everyone dismisses glass door but i'm like yeah there is like i got made fun of from the michael saylor podcast i brought that up i'm like yeah it's not like facts but it's like there's a signal that you can learn a little bit it's the glass door people only go on glass door when they really hate you so it's like the voices of the people who hate you most and if the people who hate you most are saying good things or at least okay things that's a really good sign right i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back

so yeah my guy is um dan gilbert um and the reason i thought he was super interesting i've talked about him a little bit in the past but this guy has had a freaking massive year so uh you know two years ago or something he was worth like six seven eight billion dollars uh baby billionaire now he's worth 57 billion wait five minutes seven five seven fifty seven he's number twenty one one of the wealthiest people in the united states um and this is he's had a crazy couple years so i think it was about two years ago he had a massive stroke so he was on the golf course with a friend and uh the doc the friend just happened to be a doctor and he said oh that's weird i'm having these symptoms so his doctor got him to the hospital and they he had a stroke in the hospital and in the hospital they were able to do this special procedure that if he hadn't been in the hospital he might have died or it might have been way worse right so he got super lucky yeah and you know as lucky as one can be having a stroke horrible thing and uh now he's been basically rehabilitating himself and getting back on his feet for last two years and so he's had this horrible personal tragedy but at the same time he's become worth you know 6x uh you know as much and i bet he would give it all away to not have had the stroke or whatever so it's super fascinating um this guy he described it really well when they ipo'd they just ipo'd his mortgage business he said this is a 30-year or sorry an overnight success 30 years in the making so this guy's been at it for a really long time i think he's super interesting because he started with nothing um his dad owned a struggling detroit bar he worked in pizza delivery he just kind of stumbled into hustling and was a good sales person and he started a business and that business was a company called rock financial which became quicken loans which i'll talk about in a second um one of the reasons i think he's really interested interesting is that he's invested into revitalizing his home city so his mission is to revitalize detroit and get it back on its feet because it's struggled a lot um he's like a capitalist batman in detroit and i'll talk about some of the cool stuff he's done um and one of the things i like about him as well is that he uh he uh does a lot of stuff that might not work he takes big swings takes big risks that he think can make the world better um and he invests in all sorts of crazy ideas uh he also has five kids which i think is pretty freaking cool uh i love to see that with these you know billionaires they're not just like miserable by themselves and they care about kids and stuff and seems pretty family focused um and then you know he's been through these personal challenges this stroke and then also his eldest son was born with this disease called neurofibromatosis which is like super rare and he's poured a bunch of money uh his own money into funding research around that disease so it's been fascinating um so he said uh there's a quote he said when i when we grew up all i wanted to do was do two things own a sports team and a casino and now he owns both so this is kind of like a childhood dream and his companies are quicken loans which is the largest home mortgage lender in the united states they're bigger than wells fargo which is freaking crazy uh he owns the cleveland cavaliers the basketball team and a few other sports franchises until recently he owned a casino i think it was called jack which owned a whole bunch of casinos but i think he sold it and then he also owns rock ventures and rock ventures is where all the big swings happen and all the philanthropic stuff happens so um they own a ton of real estate almost all in detroit and then they do venture capital and they've invested in everything from uh restaurants to uh you know real estate businesses hotels crazy tech companies and all sorts of other stuff he owns rob report which is like one more thing can i tell you a few more things that he owns that's interesting um so he owns i think he owns fat head do you know fat head yeah yeah i believe sports it's like those like big hands and stuff and like yeah yeah weird if you're a kid and you want to put like a like the face of michael jordan on your wall it's like a decal that you put on your wall i think he owns the whole thing he just bought dictionary.com and thesaurus.com um totally random we were actually we helped him i know him i'll talk about that a little bit but uh we helped him with that acquisition a little bit oh no way so you know about it it was like a it's like a 20 million dollar revenue thing or more maybe um it's been doing that for like 10 years i i mean i don't have any insider information these are guesses um and am i right yeah yeah he owns dictionary.com and thesaurus.com um and like when you talk to him about why he bought it he's just like you know i think this is cool like he's just like i had all these ideas of things i could do with it he's not like going oh i bought it for x times ebitda and i'm gonna make a 20 return and this is what i find so cool about this guy is he'll just say yes so he owns like rob report which is like a magazine for rich people dictionary.com um he owns or has a very large stake in shinola so shinola has this like insane hotel in detroit they make watches uh he owns stockx which is like a it's basically like a stock market for sneakers and watches which is awesome because like he co-founded it he's i know he's like in his hell is he in the 70s yet he's like 50 50 something 56 i think he's that young wow okay that's a little bit older than like a sneaker head uh and he totally i he's a co-founder i didn't know that so he was it he esports he's got investments in esports like just all sorts of stuff and then he's also a large lp and a lot of venture funds kind of quietly like he's the largest lp in ludlow ventures he's got his own venture fund and so you look at it and he's got this barbell right he's got a really kind of dull boring you know mortgage business which is really innovative in and of itself just what he's done is kind of like brad what he's done is like basically taken this fragmented crappy industry run by banks and small lenders and like built out this massive structure and been very innovative around culture and other stuff so let me let me just give the history of what happened though so basically in 1985 him and his little brother uh start rock financial which is basically a independent mortgage lender so when someone you know needs a house or whatever it is they go to them they figure out they basically make them an offer to lend them the money and then i think they go sell the risk so they would lend them the money and then they would sell it off to a bank over time um and basically in the late 1990s company grew into a huge business one of the largest uh independent in the united states and with the dot-com boom they launched an internet strategy where they just made uh rock financial i think it was rockfinancial.com or digitalmortgage.com or something like that and in uh and in 2000 what was it no 1997 or something intuit acquired their business because they were like oh my god this is like you know this huge disruptive digital finance thing and so um what ended up happening is the dot-com boom blew up and in 2002 he came back and he bought his business back so he sold it for a ton of money into it first sale was 90 million okay is that right he basically i i don't know i don't have the exact number here but um something like that so you know the guy made a lot of money especially for the 90s but he wasn't like a crazy billionaire yet then he raised money from investors so himself and some friends went back to intuit bought it back i don't know what the number was and what's interesting is they kept the quicken loans name so intuit owns quicken the financial personal finance software and they branded it quicken and so now there's this weird other business they own called quicken loans even though that's an intuit brand so it's kind of a funny uh thing and it just kept hibiscus he took it took it back got rid of all the crap into it that added and started growing at a great again and this whole time he's living in detroit and watching his own city totally fall apart so in the financial crisis uh you know detroit i think went bankrupt and he meanwhile is like super rich and living out in the suburbs and he says it we're moving back into detroit and he moves his entire team uh into detroit so he had four thousand or so uh employees they literally bought if you actually go to detroit there's this um it's called campus martius or something and it's right in the center of downtown this huge building and he moved everywhere and there and he basically said for my own employees and for the city we're just going to fix it and so he built uh casinos he built like a private security uh firm so if you walk around there's like there's like normal police and then there's like dan's police um he bought billions of dollars of derelict buildings uh you know literally like you go there and there's like skyscrapers and he's just it's like going to chicago and he's like oh yeah i own the sears tower and this and this and like basically all of downtown detroit he owns like 20 30 percent of and um he also just announced that he's going to pay off 300 million dollars of property taxes for detroit residences so this guy really really cares about detroit and since since he started it it's now become the largest uh independent mortgage business in in the united states uh you know they've gone public they had this huge ipo um and it's been it's been a crazy story i love about this guy is just he's got such a crazy collection of businesses i think if i remember correctly i think i'm probably i think i'm right but i believe he sold it for 90 he bought it back for like 20 and i think he took it public did he take it public like either recently or right away quite recently like it was like like uh six months ago and he owned most of it when it went public he owned like 85 or 90 of it and it went totally crazy what's the market cap now the market cap is let's see here market caps 46 billion dollars wow so yeah where's the other 10 billion come from just as other just as otherwise a lot yeah a lot of real estate you think the cavaliers are probably worth you know five hundred million twenty we've forgotten about that whole part you know all these stockx is worth i think a couple billion dollars now um so he's just got this crazy collection of stuff and and so chris and i got to meet him um the other cool thing about this guy is like he's just a wild card like i so i read about him in the new york times they did this profile of him and i i have this habit of just cold emailing people i think are interesting and like 95 of the time i just don't hear back but i wrote him an email at like one in the morning and said hey you you know i'd love to meet you and i get an email back like five minutes later and he's just like yeah sure and then i got a follow-up from his assistant and we ended up flying to detroit and it you know sometimes when you go and meet these billionaires they're like whatever you know you walk in you get 20 minutes with them that's that he was like incredible they like planned this whole tour of detroit it was like this two-day thing like ever they set us up in their hotel um and then dan spent like two hours with us and he's just this super nice guy he's like deeply interested in what we're doing um and super engaged and like every business i mentioned to him he'd be like how does that work how can we get involved what can we do how can we do it like he wants to say yes to ideas which i always find really inspiring right because i think some of these people have gotten really rich they've gotten rich by being like hyper disciplined and just saying no to everything but he says yes before no that's really interesting that's what shawn acts like and i usually i usually say no to everything sean says yes to everything and my joke is that like i'm like my success is probably gonna be quite predictable and it will be really good sean's success is he's gonna go completely broke and die like young or he's gonna become a billionaire super fat like you know it's like a it's a high risk high reward thing and that's not the reality but that's my joke i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back

it was pretty crazy i got a chance to talk to warren buffett on the phone um some some guy i was talking to i was saying you know i'm trying to figure out philanthropy and how to give money away and literally he goes oh you should talk to warren buffett and i was like what do you mean and then he just like cc introed me to warren buffett right it was one of the weirdest things that's ever happened to me and it was amazing and i was like kind of nervous like warren buffett's like my hero uh you know i i was never not expecting this it was just like a random friday and warren buffett's secretary emails me back and just says oh yeah you know call call him whenever you know he'll he'll pick up and so i call and they get i get put right through and it's just warren freaking buffett on the phone and basically he said you know oh yeah i'm not doing anything i can talk for as long as you want and i just got to pick his brain for an hour uh and it was insanely inspiring i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like my days off on the road let's travel never looking back all right uh shawn is out with his new baby i asked andrew to come on and do this and i wanted to do a special segment today called billy of the week we actually used to do these at the end of some episodes but people liked it and i want to do them more often i asked andrew to come on we have two people who were ready to discuss and andrew uh andrew doesn't know the format the way that here's what i wanted to do i'll go first because i think i did more research than you but it looks like you actually did a fair bit um i'll go first i'm going to tell you who i'm talking about and i'm going to explain to you why they're interesting and then maybe and i and i picked this person on purpose maybe you can tell me who or like what other opportunities are in this space or uh and i kind of pick someone similar to you but the guy is probably twice your age so uh he's further along his journey um but i think it's interesting to you but we can also talk about anything else we want to talk about as we go yeah sounds awesome um also what's going on how are you uh you enjoying being the ceo or the founder of a publicly traded company yeah yeah it's interesting it's kind of like um you know when you start your company it's really exhilarating um you know you have your first employees you start dealing with problems and you've never done it before and so your stress level is like 10 out of 10 when you're first doing it you're like i don't know what matters i don't know what best practices are if i have a problem with an employee how do i deal with it all that kind of stuff it's that same learning curve so it's like incredibly exhilarating and exciting having a public company it's like a huge milestone but at the same time i'm like i'm like a new entrepreneur like i don't know what actually matters who to listen to where to focus sometimes and that's just you know you do anything new and it's stressful so it's been stressful uh for sure but now i feel like we're on the other side of it we're starting to feel uh figure it out and uh it's been really good is your stop i ha i check your stuff once a week um is it up this week or down or do not even look i think it's it's kind of coasting i try not to look at it yeah it's kind of jumping between about 650 million and a billion dollars depending on the week wow um and our podcast has been growing a ton and people have criticized me for not doing introductions so first of all i'm sam parr i co-host this with sean perry who is now way more famous than i am because he's crushing it on content um but i started this thing called the hustle just sold it for mid-eight figures to uh hubspot and then andrew is a friend of sean and eyes uh andrew i'll do a quick introduction for you and then you could say but andrew started this thing called metal lab which is a an agency that makes all types of amazing stuff and using the products or using the profit from his agency he went and bought a ton of companies and invested in a ton of stuff now his whole enterprise does like 100 million ish in revenue very profitable and he just did a spec and took one of his uh uh pixel union one of uh we commerce he took one of his companies that makes shopify plugins and took it public and it's now at a six five hundred six hundred seven hundred million dollar market cap did i miss anything there yeah i mean i i kind of uh i always think like i'm a designer who ended up becoming an investor just like how sam's a writer who ended up becoming an entrepreneur um it's been a process of just kind of stumbling into stuff and a lot of why we've gotten as big as we have is because i just i don't like doing stuff that i don't like doing and so i just kept delegating the stuff i didn't enjoy and when you do that a lot uh in its kind of final form that's just investing where you're hiring ceos to run your companies and incentivizing them um yeah it's it's crazy i never would have thought we would get to the size we're at now and it's been it's been a cool ride and the reason i'm asking this next question it's because it's related to the first story i want to get to but how many companies does uh how many let's say how many companies do you guys own or partly own and then how many have you invested in and own like a like a like a smallish check size so we control um as in like we have over you know 50 51 in i think 35 businesses and then we have another probably 40 to 50 um minority investments so those would be anything from like little hundred thousand dollar venture bets to minority prep equity where we might own 10 or 15 of a business so in the 100 range-ish total deals yeah something like that so the guy i'm going to talk about today his name is brad jacobs bradley jacobs i think he goes by but we're gonna call him brad jacobs and this person is super interesting because they have started uh five companies that have either gone public or are worth over a billion dollars he started age 23 he's 64 now uh google them brad jacobs he's worth somewhere in the range of three four five billion dollars and he's bought or in both he doesn't like invest passively like a venture check they buy companies and he's bought something like six 700 companies and he's done it across a variety of industries and he's done the same strategy over and over and over again in different industries and it's incredibly interesting and this guy uh is very fascinating to me for a variety of reasons that i'm going to explain but andrew have you heard of this guy brad jacobs do you know anything about this never i don't know anything that's kind of why he's cool he's kind of on the under the radar if you google him he's uh he's got like a bald head and he looks like a finance guy because he wears a tie and he's like pretty um well spoken and you think that he's just like a private equity person and i guess maybe he is but he's really an entrepreneur he's very entrepreneurial and he's uh far more interesting than just a lot of the typical new york hedge funny type of folks and so i'm gonna give you a quick story about his background so he started five things that have been quite meaningfully sized so the first was uh it was called amorex oil associates he started it when he was 23 and it was an oil biz it was basically like an oil brokerage firm which uh i'm not entirely sure what that entails but i imagine it just means connecting folks who created the oil to large businesses who are buying the oil and within a very short amount of time only about four years uh remember he started this when he was 23 so by the age of 27 amorex his oil business was doing 4.7 billion dollars in gross gross oil bookings meaning he would that's how much oil they're buying and uh and selling now i imagine his company kept a tiny percent of that like one or two or three percent but incredibly impressive for a young guy and after a few years he sells that business for a billion dollars then only a couple months after that he starts this thing called hamilton resource uh hamilton resource he starts out of uh uh england he convinces a french bank to give him a billion dollars line of credit which he was quite successful already even though he was crazy young but uh he made it happen and he went and secured a line of credit and here's what he said he goes we moved physical cargos of oil from one place to another the 80s turned out to be a great time in the oil business and i built hamilton up to about a billion dollars in revenues and did business in dozens of countries uh dozens of countries before i moved back to the states in 1989. so between 83 and 89 he started this business and it also was huge i believe he ended up selling it for a billion dollar north of a billion dollars so that's business number two business number three a little bit of a of an odd one was waste management um i don't think there's anyone out there doing waste management stuff now that's brand new but there's a ton of companies that at the time started in the 70s 80s and 90s like waste management the company waste management and what they did was they would go out and find tons of mom and pop waste management companies because back then that's how it was it probably is a little bit to this day but he started this thing called united waste management which eventually became the fifth largest solid waste business in america and it had a very very very simple business plan which was buy landfills and small markets by many of the local trucking companies that were serving those markets optimize the truck routes maximize the pricings get margins up achieve size so that they have the capability to scale and they did that and the strategy worked really well and in just five years our earnings compounded annually annually by 55 and the and he took the company public something like eight months after starting it and the stock price went up as well 50 every single year for like five years eventually that company grew to 3.9 billion dollars in revenue and 1.2 billion dollars in ebitda with 750 locations and 13 000 employees is this freaking crazy oh sorry that i just gave you the numbers i gave you the numbers for um his next business but the waste management grew to 2.5 billion dollars in revenue oh sorry uh 2.5 billion dollars and an exit to waste management nuts right that's crazy so i i one of the most interesting things about this is like i always think there's like um four different types of entrepreneurs right there's the innovators so let's just take let's take um chipotle as an example right so there's the innovator there's the guy who rolled the first burrito i was like oh [ __ ] this tastes really good then there's the remixer there's the person who creates chipotle they take the burrito they package it up they create a brand around it then there's the scalers the person who scales chipotle to a hundred locations and then there's the optimizer the person who just sits on top makes sure it doesn't blow up and gets as much as possible gets as much juice out of the lemon as they can and this guy's a great example of a scaler someone who just takes something that already works that's already proven and just does a much better job of it and rolls it out makes it scalable and builds something massive and it's super it's super interesting um because i'd say i i kind of fall into this camp um at the same time i feel like what's sexy about this guy is actually how boring the businesses are right they're they're so basic these are things that are like undisruptible and when you build them it's like 100-year business or something which i think is really cool whereas what we do is like five you got to think in five year uh chunks i completely agree and if you scroll up to this document that we have open and you click source um the source that i'm using for a lot of this and this is so interesting um so we're on business number three i'll get to four and five in a second but when what this guy does and then when i wrap up all five i'll explain to you what my lessons uh learn from this guy are but i'll say one of them right now which is what this guy does is he raises money like a madman and it's not like a ridiculous amount i mean saying you're raising tens of millions of dollars i guess for the for the average show yeah that is a ridiculous amount but he's got a track record and he turns them into multi-billion dollar things but uh so kind of tens of millions of dollars is not that much money um but if you click that source thing what what does that take you to to the sec okay i found this file on the scc and i don't really know what this is but i don't even remember how i came across it but this is what interested me it's a q a session of him having written it out and he basically lays out the strategy of his fourth and fifth business and so what this appears to be is a q a that he prepared and they showed this to a ton of potential investors a ton of potential banks and they decide to invest in him and i think this was before the company even started is that what that is so you're saying this is what he raised on like there's no deck there's nothing it's just this is the thing he goes out and he says read this document and you can invest i'm not entirely sure but i think that is part of it i it's called this is called a schedule 14a which i i'm not an expert in the sec i believe that is something that you have to answer before a board of directors at a publicly traded company um raises money but i'm not entirely sure but it's interesting though because he writes in wonderful straightforward simple english and you could read his entire strategy which i'm going to go through in a second um but skim that while i bring well i i'll summarize the next two businesses that he did so he started um i told you he started two oil things but base those were oil brokerage businesses then he started um well waste management business now his fourth one is called united rentals now i don't know if you see this in canada but if you pay attention to this now and if you're listening to this and you live in america go on a drive in downtown the downtown city wherever you live and look at the big box trucks and look at the rental equipment so look at um like the caterpillars or the bobcats or the the um the construction equipment as well as the um portal potties and anything involving construction or trucking go and look at those things and i guarantee you on a lot of them you're gonna see united rentals well that is the fourth company that he started and he started it with the idea of the same thing of voice management he wanted to go out and he wanted to find a massive industry that was highly segmented by small businesses where that were profitable and great but they didn't have enough capital to grow and they were kind of bad at sales and that's what he did and so he founded it and in just five years five years it grew to four billion in revenue and 1.2 billion in ebitda and is he growing via acquisition or is he just rolling this out and crushing competition across the country we're going to talk about that but what he said was we got there partly through acquisitions partly through organic growth developed by developing greenfield locations he goes we grew by using the same strategy at united ways we bought about two-thirds of the branch locations and colg started another third from scratch i actually prefer cold starts is what he said the business plan for united rentals was to become the largest equipment rental company in the world and leverage our purchasing power branding and other advantages of size within 13 months we became number one leap-frogging fleet frogging hertz which had become the equipment rental which was the number one equipment rental business in 1965. another thing we did was we went fast uh we went public fast we formed the company on labor day weekend and we were trading on the new york stock exchange by december labor day weekend is in may i think right so they started the company in may and five months is that seven months that seven months later they were public merrill lynch said it was the fastest growing or the fastest ipo they've ever seen and i stepped down uh uh and so he stepped down of united rentals in 2007 this is only five years after starting and to start the next company but when he stepped down united rentals if you look it up now i believe their market cap is 25 billion dollars so he spent five years on this company and it's worth 25 billion dollars crazy so listen to what he did after this after i stepped down i began looking for my next big thing i studied tons of industries and i ended up concentrating on transportation and logistics it's larger and more fragmented than the industries i've been i've previously been involved in it's a 13 billion dollar um sorry a 13 trillion dollar industry and here's what this guy says this guy at the time is already multi-billionaire but let me see if i um i have he wrote out what he does which was basically he basically spends three months he reads tons of reports and then he calls a hundred experts in each industry and he just goes and he sits down with them and he just asks them questions it might as well be a podcast all that's like exactly how he learned so he's this multi-billionaire he's his big shot he's done all this amazing stuff and he calls these people and he just sits down and he listens that's all he does it's pretty amazing and he did this and then he's in this with his new thing it's called xpo logist logistics have you heard of this i have i have heard of this i think it's a delivery and logistics company like a competitor to fedex at least that's my understanding well we'll put this in the show notes but in that document up top that is the document from where he was raising money for xpo logistics and then playing it looks like it's like supply chain so it's like getting people things they need that are critical on time well in there he um in that document that i sent you he i didn't i i couldn't study the whole thing but in plain english he explains kind of what they did and his reasoning for getting into it and he just says well i just studied loads of industries this one seemed industry interesting i went and um interviewed a hundred people who are experts on it i hired really good people and we're gonna do x y and z and that x y and z is exactly what he's done in his uh last businesses and now i want to wrap up by by giving you guys incredibly detailed um stats or uh incredibly detailed strategy on what he does so his first thing that he does he looks for huge industries with lots of fragmentation that are small and profitable but don't have the capital to uh to scale so here's what he says he was in a nutshell this is how you ramp up a business you buy a brokerage or some type of small business with 30 million dollars in revenue and you add 30 to 40 bodies to it and you double revenue in time i've looked into companies that have executed this plan but most of them don't have the capital to sustain it i try to find those businesses and i bring all the capital to do it the second thing that he does is he hires sales people so he says i like to hire hungry talented salespeople at a low base but big upside for incentives i fund their training for a few months and it's not that hard for the winners to build a million dollar book after a year or so um it's a business where you have to make 99 calls a day and do one or two deals so you have to hire people who are psycho i actually don't know this word what's this we have supplier people who are psycho chromatically test high on the need to win scale and low on the need to be liked scale a sales person will have a base of 25 000 or 35 000 but can make many times that amount through an incentivize a really good incentive program once you get the right people in the system and integrate them on the right i.t it can be really powerful and finally speaking of i.t when someone asked him what was the best acquisition of all time they ever made he said they made a powerful software acquisition with a politically incorrect name called rental man and we used that to integrate all of our rental businesses we rolled up into that company we couldn't have made the hundreds of acquisitions we did without rental man and that was his best acquisition of all time and that my friend is brad jacobs and i can go on i i like i both love and and um find these guys kind of mysterious and i kind of wonder like what the thing that's missing in all this is like what keeps him going what's his purpose how do you how does he use his money and and like why does he do this right what's the driving force i researched him and the guy looks like a wall street stiff did you look up what he looks like yeah he looks kind of like um there's like a character actor that he looks like i'll try and find a photo of him like a generic nerdy like steve ballmer looking kind of guy yeah he looks like he would be like in biden or trump's cabinet uh yeah yeah but i've actually seen interviews with him he's very endearing and i think that he's not actually just a stiff like wall street like just milk all the numbers out i actually think that he um just this is his bill this is his urge he just loves to build and and and he constantly talks about integrity he goes the common denominator of everything we buy is the people who we buy from have to have high integrity and also one of our moats is we take care of the people of the businesses who work for the businesses that we're inheriting in fact the biggest risk of our plan is that the people who we buy companies from they leave and so we treat them all really really well and so i don't think this is actually [ __ ] because when i got his energy from interviews i actually believed that he was a good dude and this was just his art what do you think though what do you think he does with his money is that kind of public does he do any philanthropy or or anything because i always find it so interesting i mean there's two ways to look at like doing good in the world it's like okay you do capitalism right you employ a whole bunch of people you make an industry more efficient you add to global gdp you know good things happen because he does this right but on the flip side like what's driving making more money and maybe it is just continually maniacally going industry by industry and improving them and optimizing them that's his like gift or whatever but um but the guy i'm going to talk about next is really interesting because he basically uses all his money to do crazy good things right which is really fascinating i'll talk about him in a minute but do you have any sense of what this guy does like no with his money like doesn't he like he's very much like i don't i cannot figure it out but i will i can wrap this up by saying there's a few things that i've learned from this person the first is like taking the red pill which is like have you heard i i don't know someone just used that phrase to me their day and and i'm picking it up you should be careful it's uh associated with all sorts of not so uh not so positive connotations oh well i didn't know that what i mean is like i guess his perspective like when you look at what this person is capable of doing you think or when you read what he's done if you didn't know it was true you would say well that's impossible no one can do that but the person has done it repeatedly over and over and over again and he seems pretty nonchalant about that and so my what i'm learning from him is that um you can create these amazing things and it's hard but maybe could be kind of simple well it's so inspiring right you basically go find an industry that has let's look at the restaurant and industry in general right restaurants are disorganized they're very difficult businesses they're very low margin people have done this essentially in restaurants by building fast food chains right so you go in you build systems you do training you incentivize people the right way and you can make a lot of money doing that but you can't make a lot of money usually in an individual restaurant so what he's done is he's gone out and fun he finds these fragmented disorganized industries like you know waste management or logistics and he goes okay i'm gonna do the fast food chain uh except for that industry it's yeah and and it's really really cool um the second thing that that i learned is he actually does the same thing as you well i actually don't know your numbers but i bet you they're similar he likes to buy companies between five and ten times earnings um and that's like his number um that's what i mean yeah i'd say i love to buy businesses for that um that valuation or whatever um but the problem the problem with buying a business at that valuation is like you're buying kind of a crappy business often if it's going to be that low well these are trash what he's doing yeah exactly what he's doing is kind of building a platform where he's like i just need one so i can build the systems and then i can go and acquire a whole bunch more and the final thing and then we can move on is the guy loves debt and often times that ends bad but i personally have zero debt in my life and i've never really had debt and i actually think though that not having debt or not having some type of leverage is silly and i've read articles about him and he talks about it very unemotionally like he seems like a really charismatic emotional guy but he's like yeah look like this makes total sense because i can grow this business at 30 percent uh therefore the cost if i look at the cost of capital i should allocate capital this and it just makes sense and i hear that i'm like yeah everything you're saying makes total sense i'm just so fearful and it's really cool that you don't seem to have that fear and i think that's interesting yeah and i think debt that's it goes back to like not having fatal potential potential blow ups in your life right so i've heard everything from like you know i was talking to a guy and he was saying i'm super rich guy and he goes i've paid off my house in full i never have a mortgage or whatever and it just gives him that sense of security maybe this guy has he's so rich he's already made a whole bunch of money on other stuff that he can take a little more risk or he knows how to structure dead or whatever it is um you hear both things and the problem is you only hear the stories about the guys who levered up and did really well there may be a whole bunch of other brad jacob types who went out levered up and it totally [ __ ] them they hit a speed bump oh yeah lost all that money so the interesting thing about this though um the and the difference between what we do in this guy is this guy's essentially starting a new business um and what we like to do is find a business that's already working where we can actually just leave it and make it you know maybe we'll help plug in a new ceo or something like that but we're actually not messing with it we're not changing the dna this guy's like modifying the dna he's doing like crispr on these businesses he's working and working with them and turning that he's working really hard right so i don't like to work hard i get really excited when i hear about people like this i'm so glad they exist but i'm like oh my god this is a big lift i don't want to do it's a big lift but it does seem cool it's cool uh it's this is like cornrows or sleeve tattoos i think they're cool i just don't want it they're cool for certain people and it works great for them exactly face tattoos not it's pretty sick that someone else has it but i don't know if i want it totally totally um and i i i think again going back to like this guy does make the world better because he employs a lot of people in industries where you know people aren't getting laid off because of this guy right because he's managed this business better he can probably pay people better give them more opportunity um he's not going to lay them off because he's got this global business so it's very it's very positive but what i would want to understand is what's the guy do with the money what's driving him like is he like a sad empty hole where he's like i have to keep doing this all the time or is he like you know donating it all to charity or views this as super philanthropic in and of itself i'm super curious about that um i don't know i i like the only thing that i saw is that he has a good glass door rating um which i actually everyone dismisses glassdoor but i'm like yeah it there is like i got made fun of from the michael saylor podcast i brought that up i'm like yeah it's not like facts but it's like there's a signal that you can learn a little bit it's the glass door people only go on glassdoor when they really hate you so it's like the voices of the people who hate you most and if the people who hate you most are saying good things or at least okay things that's a really good sign right so anyway it's interesting but let's move on to your guy because i actually know who this guy is or i know of him um so yeah my guy is um dan gilbert um and the reason i thought he was super interesting i've talked about him a little bit in the past but this guy has had a freaking massive year so uh you know two years ago or something he was worth like six seven eight billion dollars uh baby billionaire now he's worth 57 billion wait five seven five seven 57 he's number 21 one of the wealthiest people in the united states um and this is he's had a crazy couple years so i think it was about two years ago he had a massive stroke so he was on the golf course with a friend and the doc the friend just happened to be a doctor and he said oh that's weird i'm having these symptoms so his doctor got him to the hospital and they he had a stroke in the hospital and in the hospital they were able to do this special procedure that if he hadn't been in the hospital he might have died or it might have been way worse right so he got super lucky yeah and you know as lucky as one can be having a stroke horrible thing and uh now he's been basically rehabilitating himself and getting back on his feet for last two years and so he's had this horrible personal tragedy but at the same time he's become worth you know 6x uh you know as much and i bet he would give it all away to not have had the stroke or whatever so it's super fascinating um this guy uh he described it really well when they ipo they just ipo'd his mortgage business he said this is a 30 year or sorry an overnight success 30 years in the making um so this guy's been at it for a really long time um i think he's super interesting because he started with nothing um his dad owned a struggling detroit bar he worked in pizza delivery he just kind of stumbled into hustling and was a good sales person and he started a business and that business was a company called uh rock financial which became quicken loans which i'll talk about in a second one of the reasons i think he's really interested interesting is that he's invested into revitalizing his home city so his mission is to revitalize detroit and get it back on its feet because it's struggled a lot um he's like a capitalist batman in detroit and i'll talk about some of the cool stuff he's done and one of the things i like about him as well is that he uh he uh does a lot of stuff that might not work he takes big swings takes big risks that he think can make the world better and he invests in all sorts of crazy ideas uh he also has five kids which i think is pretty freaking cool i love to see that he's you know billionaires they're not just like miserable by themselves and they care about kids and stuff and seems pretty family focused um and then you know he's been through these personal challenges this stroke and then also his eldest son was born with this disease called neurofibromatosis which is like super rare and he's poured a bunch of money uh his own money into funding research around that disease so it's been fascinating um so he said uh there's a quote he said when i when we grew up all i wanted to do uh was do two things own a sports team and a casino and now he owns both uh so this is kind of like a childhood dream and his companies are quicken loans which is the largest home mortgage lender in the united states they're bigger than wells fargo which is freaking crazy uh he owns the cleveland cavaliers the basketball team and a few other sports franchises until recently he owned a casino i think it was called jack which owned a whole bunch of casinos but i think he sold it and then he also owns rock ventures and rock ventures is where all the big swings happen and all the philanthropic stuff happens so they own a ton of real estate almost all in detroit and then they do venture capital and they've invested in everything from uh restaurants to you know real estate businesses hotels crazy tech companies and all sorts of other stuff he owns rob report which is like walmart can i tell you a few more things that he owns that's interesting um so he owns i think he owns fat head do you know fat head yeah yeah i believe sports it's like those like big hands and stuff and like yeah yeah weird if you're a kid and you want to put like a like the face of michael jordan on your wall it's like a decal that you put on your wall i think he owns the whole thing he just bought dictionary.com and thesaurus.com um totally random we were actually we helped him i know him i'll talk about that a little bit but uh we helped him with that acquisition a little bit oh no way so you know about it it was like a it's like a 20 million dollar revenue thing or more maybe um it's been doing that for like 10 years i i mean i don't have any insider information these are guesses um and am i right yeah yeah he owns dictionary.com and thesaurus.com um and like when you talk to him about why he bought it he's just like you know i think this is cool like he's just like i had all these ideas of things i could do with it he's not like going oh i bought it for x times ebitda and i'm gonna make a 20 return and this is what i find so cool about this guy is he'll just say yes so he owns like rob report which is like a magazine for rich people dictionary.com um he owns shi or has a very large stake in shinola so shinola has this like insane hotel in detroit they make watches uh he owns uh stockx which is like a it's basically like a stock market for sneakers and watches which is awesome on that because like he co-founded like his si hell is he in the 70s yet he's like 50 50 something 56 i think he's that young wow okay that's a little bit older than like a sneaker head uh and he totally i he's a co-founder i know that so he was it he sports he's got investments in esports like just all sorts of stuff and then he's also a large lp and a lot of venture funds kind of quietly like he's the largest lp in ludlow ventures he's got his own venture fund and so you look at it and he's got this barbell right he's got a really kind of dull boring you know mortgage business which is really innovative in and of itself just what he's done is kind of like brad what he's done is like basically taking this fragmented crappy industry run by banks and small lenders and like built out this massive structure and been very innovative around culture and other stuff um so let me let me just give the history of what happened though so basically in 1985 him and his little brother uh start rock financial which is basically a independent mortgage lender so when someone you know needs a house or whatever it is they go to them they figure out they basically make them an offer to lend them the money and then i think they go sell the risk so they would lend them the money and then they would sell it off to a bank over time um and basically in the late 1990s company grew into a huge business one of the largest uh independent in the united states and with the dot-com boom they launched an internet strategy where they just made uh rock financial i think it was rockfinancial.com or digitalmortgage.com or something like that and in uh and in 2000 what was it no 1997 or something intuit acquired their business because they were like oh my god this is like you know this huge disruptive digital finance thing and so um what ended up happening is the dot-com boom blew up and in 2002 he came back and he bought his business back so he sold it for a ton of money into it her sale was 90 million okay is that right he basically i i don't know i don't have the exact number here but um something like that so you know the guy made a lot of money especially for the 90s but he wasn't like a crazy billionaire yet then he raised money from investors so himself and some friends went back to intuit bought it back i don't know what the number was and what's interesting is they kept the quicken loans name so intuit owns quicken the financial personal finance software and they branded it quicken and so now there's this weird other business they own called quicken loans even though that's an intuit brand so it's kind of a funny uh thing and it just kept hibiscu took it took it back got rid of all the crap into it that added and started growing at a again and this whole time he's living in detroit and watching his own city totally fall apart so in the financial crisis uh you know detroit i think went bankrupt and he meanwhile is like super rich and living out in the suburbs and he says [ __ ] it we're moving back into detroit and he moves his entire team uh into detroit so he had 4 000 or so employees they literally bought if you actually go to detroit there's this um it's called campus martius or something and it's right in the center of downtown this huge building um and he moved everyone there and he basically said for my own employees and for the city we're just gonna fix it and so he built uh casinos he built like a private security uh firm so if you walk around there's like there's like normal police and then there's like dan's police um he bought billions of dollars of derelict buildings uh you know literally like you go there and there's like skyscrapers and he's just it's like going to chicago and he's like oh yeah i own the sears tower and this and this and like basically all of downtown detroit he owns like 20 30 percent of and um he also just announced that he's gonna pay off 300 million dollars of property taxes for detroit residences so this guy really really cares about detroit and since since he started it it's now become the largest uh independent mortgage business in in the united states uh you know they've gone public they had this huge ipo and it's been it's been a crazy story what i love about this guy is just he's got such a crazy collection of businesses i think if i remember correctly i think i'm probably i think i'm right but i believe he sold it for 90. he bought it back for like 20. and i think he took it public did he take it public like either recently or right away quite recently like it was like like uh six months ago and he owned most of it when it went public he owned like 85 or 90 percent of it and it went it's totally crazy what's the market cap now the market cap is let's see here market caps 46 billion dollars wow so yeah where's the other 10 billion come from just his other stu just as others he owns a lot yeah a lot of real estate you think the cavaliers are probably worth you know 500 million to it we forgot about that whole part here you know all these stockx is worth i think a couple billion dollars now um so he's just got this crazy collection of stuff and and so chris and i got to meet him um the other cool thing about this guy is like he's just a wild card like i so i read about him in the new york times they did this profile of him and i i have this habit of just cold emailing people i think are interesting and like 95 of the time i just don't hear back but i wrote him an email at like one in the morning and said hey you you know i'd love to meet you and i get an email back like five minutes later and he's just like yeah sure and then i got a follow-up from his assistant and we ended up flying to detroit and it you know sometimes when you go and meet these billionaires they're like whatever you know you walk in you get 20 minutes with them that's that he was like incredible they like planned this whole tour of detroit it was like this two-day thing like ev they set us up in their hotel um and then dan spent like two hours with us and he's just this super nice guy he's like deeply interested in what we're doing um and super engaged and like every business i mentioned to him he'd be like how does that work how can we get involved what can we do how can we do it like he wants to say yes to ideas which i always find really inspiring right because i think some of these people have gotten really rich they've gotten rich by being like hyper disciplined and just saying no to everything but he says yes before no that's really interesting that's what shawn acts like and i usually i usually say no to everything sean says yes to everything and my joke is that like i'm like my success is probably going to be quite predictable and it will be really good sean's success is he's gonna go completely broke and die like young or he's gonna become a billionaire super fat like you know it's like a it's a high risk high reward type of thing and that's not the reality but that's my joke but um and you actually can you tell the story of how you met someone recently who's a big deal and they said like oh just call whenever like i'm free all day yeah uh so i recently got um yeah well i got i was pretty crazy i got a chance to talk to warren buffett on the phone um some some guy i was talking to i was saying you know i'm trying to figure out philanthropy and how to give money away and literally he goes oh you should talk to warren buffett and i was like what do you mean and then he just like cc intro'd me to warren buffett right it was one of the weirdest things that's ever happened to me and it was amazing and i was like kind of nervous like warren buffett's like my hero uh you know i i was never not expecting this it was just like a random friday and warren buffett's secretary emails me back and just says oh yeah you know call call him whenever you know he'll he'll pick up and so i call and they get i could put right through and it's just warren freaking buffett on the phone and basically he said you know oh yeah i'm not doing anything i can talk for as long as you want and i just got to pick his brain for an hour uh and it was insanely inspiring right like this guy he was exactly who you'd expect him to be i find with a lot of these guys it's like don't meet your heroes and uh they're not who they appear to be on tv all day he's available all day he talked to me for an hour and a half and he was just the nicest guy he's exactly like he was on his cnbc interviews showed a ton of interest in what i was doing and like i literally just like grilled him for like 30 minutes yeah he's definitely on a landline and it was just it's always it's always really nice when someone is what you hoped they'd be that's great so we'll bring it back to gilbert but just so you know i have a feeling the clip that you just said about buffett that's gonna go viral um uh so hopefully you're okay with that uh and if you're not you could tell us um all right um you you have something here about his strategy and his culture because i actually wanna know what motivates this guy and do you think that he was so i actually sent this to you i think i use newspapers.newspaper.com and i actually like to read all articles and i read a ton of old articles about rock financial and even before it got bought by quicken dan was like a detroit guy it seemed like it was like he was very um confident not arrogant but he was like he just had the it factor at a young age it seems like and um then i read his uh what's it called the 10k or s1 when they go public and uh he was like 30 and everyone on his company was like in their 40s so it was like he was like a young guy and the business was booming and very interesting very seemed like a very confident person at a young age what do you think motivated i think he's been super rich for a long time well yeah i was going to say like he says there's a great quote he says one of our things is that money follows it does not lead so we want people that are fired up and passionate about their mission and people that aren't so married to spreadsheets and thinking that kind that kind of voodoo controls the future because it doesn't so this theme of doing things because it's cool or because it makes sense or because you're driven to do it versus based on financial analysis and that's the feeling i get about this guy is like he says yes and he wings it and he takes risks and he takes big bets and i think it goes back to this thing of what's the point of making a bunch of money if you're not going to try and do cool stuff with it and so he's just very very inspiring in that way and one of the ways that he wins is that he focuses massively on culture so when we visited him uh you know he probably had five or six thousand employees at the time and he said i still personally on board every single employee so once a month i go into like a conference center and there's a you know 100 or 200 new employees coming in and i will spend all day with them talking to them about our culture and what you know what we represent and he gave me this book and he calls it isms these are the like the ideals that they live by or whatever and usually you get these stupid corporate bse things like you know we value integrity or whatever but it's this series of um of kind of like words to live by so you know some of them yes before no money doesn't follow it leads we'll figure it out every second counts yeah a penny saved is a penny you know don't obsess over saving just do the right thing uh anyway i i just love how he does that and then i also love again this barbell strategy uh where he's got a conservative cash flowing business and that funds crazy [ __ ] and big bets and interesting stuff um and you know he also said anyone who dies with money in the bank is a failure right so this is not a guy who's going to go hoard it or whatever he's going to give it all back to society which i think is super cool that's great do you think does he have um so none of this would have been possible without quicken working out yeah was he has he was he always hands on or did he delegate right away you think well he's got this really smart ceo called jay farner and jay my understanding is jay now runs that business and dan floats above doing all of his different stuff but i don't know i think jay's been there for a really long time so i'm not sure but i think he was the he's the chairman or something i think he's kind of taken that role where he starts up the business he's super involved he's still on but he he kind of lets someone else operate it day-to-day damn this is awesome i i've heard him talk my and i judged him incorrectly i think because he's a nice dresser and he's kind of good looking i and he like slicks like literally slicks his hair back i thought that he was frankly kind of a douche um and i heard him talk a couple times and i'm like oh wait this guy is not how i thought he was going to be super humble yeah he he talks like with the michigan accent he is super down-to-earth super funny like we when we were meeting him we're like god this guy's like he owns casinos he's got slicked back hair he almost dresses like a gangster or something he's got like kind of a serious yeah you look and you know there's a story about him like punching a guy in the face at a party like you're kind of like who is this guy but when you meet him he's just completely real and down to earth and cool and and i would say one we've met lots of very successful people and i'd say he's one of the only ones that i would go you know there's a small list of people where i'd go i'd really want to be like this guy right i'd love to trade lives with him is he grinding still or does he relax a little well i don't know i mean i think with the stroke there's a question of you know did he have the stroke because he was stressed or you know high blood pressure i i don't know um but i'm not sure i i don't know what his uh approach to work is or whatever i haven't worked super deeply with him i mean we looked at that dictionary.com thing for him gave him our feedback on what we would do with it um and we've we've done like you know meta lab worked with with quicken loans a little bit and dan's lit me up before via text saying you know this design sucks and you need to make it better but again like that's what's cool about him is like he's running this freaking 60 billion dollar empire and yet he's still texting me going hey this website sucks and that color's wrong and you know tweak this um he's just he's a real person right and so many of these guys they're like reptilian right these bill they're they're too slick they they're never you know never out of place they won't admit any of their flaws and you know it's neat when you meet people and they're just real they're flawed human beings uh they're doing cool stuff that's great i've i've just become a dan gilbert fan i i prepared more than you i think and i think you you picked the right guy and you won i think i think you've won uh i've become uh you've convinced me to become a um a gilbert fan a dan gilbert fan he um he also uh is really into hip-hop culture so like he did um i think he's the biggest investor in rap genius which is not really relevant anymore but better for worse yeah for better for worse correct but it's whatever i mean you're gonna lose sometimes if you say yes to everything but that's cool that he said yes to that and he's in uh so he's kind of got like street cred and he does actually seem like a pretty cool guy um um and then that dictionary.com deal i according to the news it said that he bought it for a hundred million which is pretty sick i bet you that company could do 10 or 15 million a year in profit if it wanted to um but you would know more than i do but that's pretty sick i'm a dan gilbert fan now yeah me too um abreu what do you think of our first episode of billy's billy's but billy of the week i liked it i think there's a lot to take away from both those guys i'm curious to see what people's reactions are going to be but i think this could become a weekly thing sick um i think we're scheduled to do it for at least one more week right andrew are we doing we're gonna do the same format next time you want to do a different one well i like well i like doing this but the research is annoying it's so much fun when i can just wing it i have something cool for you so okay at hubspot we now have two full-time researchers so if you'd like we can send a couple people to them i mean i didn't do it this time but abray you can uh we'll hook it up you mention a few people who you're interested in and our researchers will take care of it oh dude i love that that's awesome so uh if you're looking for mr mr corporate big shot i know it's trust me it's also where's your crazy camera set up are you on your like crazy dslr right now no but have you you've seen it right it's real nice right yeah it looks amazing i um i'm driving to st louis to meet a newborn baby uh my my niece but i am stopping in oklahoma city to meet up with a bunch of listeners because that was like the middle ground and so i just tweeted out i'll be in oklahoma city and like 50 people signed up so i decided to stop and stay and meet people and then i'm going to drive to st louis tomorrow isn't it isn't it crazy when you think about i remember doing this with our um we had this invoicing software like 10 years ago or whatever and uh it was really small but we had thousands of customers and you don't realize like for you you're just doing a podcast and you see these numbers it's like oh yeah like we got 20 000 listeners or whatever when you actually think like okay there's actually 20 000 people all over the world listening to you who feel like they know you and when you tweet out that hey i'm in oklahoma city some random city in the united states and 50 people show up in person that's freaking cool it was even more yeah i was shocked more people tried to rsvp and then i tweeted that i was in or i was going here and then someone was like hey i own this fancy hotel would you like to stay here i go yup you guys have a restaurant he goes yep i go all right i'm gonna have 50 people come and we just created an event by page and it's sold out right i mean wait are you vaccinated yeah oh dude it's taking forever in canada it's gonna be like another two months yeah i'm vaccinated and uh i still wear the mask to make people comfortable but uh i'm vaccinated so i'm just going to i don't know i i i don't even know you got two dose or one dose two hmm which one's the problem yeah yeah it was one of those uh i'm so jealous i'm so i'm so done me and my wife got it done um and uh so that's why i'm i'm i'm traveling a little bit do you think that this will be like you're gonna be happier as a result of this like you this [ __ ] it's kind of like you had a hundred days of rain and then all of a sudden it's sunny and you appreciate it way more than if you lived in southern california like did you just have like a boring year and now it's super exciting does it feel like you've just been letter to prison or something from a personal perspective from a business perspective from fitness from bot from like my bodies and i don't want to sound callous because i know there's bad stuff covid was so good to me i i loved i mean i kicked ass my family night we we crushed it i enjoyed the down time i enjoyed getting fit i enjoyed moving business-wise business boomed um are you in the same boat no i would say um if anything like i have a tendency to be a workaholic and so what i used to do is i would go work at a cafe and then i'd run into my buddies who would also go to the same cafe or someone i knew would come and i'd have lunch with them or i'd go for a walk and it would just force me to kind of get away from work and have more perspective and break up my day or i'd be still working but i'd be going from meeting to meeting the meeting and getting eye contact and face time and now um all i do is work right like i'm just it's basically i'm at a i'm at a house like i work out of a house that we rent and then i drive home and that's it and it's been this winter it's been too cold up here in canada to really go and sit on a patio and so it's a total bummer and i'm like an extreme extrovert like i love spending like two three hours with other people every day so it's been it's been grinding on me for sure why don't you come down to texas because well so my wife and i've been building a house for the last three years we're moving into the new house at the end of this month and otherwise i've been i've gone to my wife but like we just need to move to hawaii for six months and just f off go get vaccinated and then wait for the border to reopen the reason i can't fly to texas is if i fly over the border when you come back to canada there's a mandatory two-week government quarantine even if you're vaccinated so it means with two kids i gotta be stuck in the house or by myself my kids can't go to school it's just like that's not fun do you the the downside that i've had is so many i've met people digitally and i hate that i have so many online friends and so my phone texts are always my i get so many and it's not like because i'm necessarily popular but uh i get so many text messages i get so many emails uh i do phone calls all the time and so my problem is i don't want people to contact me anymore or i just ignore them um and so it goes back to like this problem that you'd be so stoked to have like five years ago like i have the same problem of like i post on twitter and then someone dm's me hey check out my business and would you get on the phone with me and talk about it and five years ago it would have been like stoked i'm like oh my god i can help all these entrepreneurs and make all these new friends and now it's like i get 20 of those a day and i just want everyone to leave me alone and like i'm trying to figure out how to even just deal with the amount of email and text i'm getting and this is this is the downside with scale right like with 35 businesses there's always something happening there's always a problem to solve or some a text to respond to or an email and so it's uh pros and cons right i always make this kind of i historically i always kind of claim to be this guy where i'm like oh i have this great life i have all this freedom i don't run my businesses but that worked when we were 20 companies two years ago now i'm hitting this threshold where i'm like okay i'm back to being busy again how do i restructure this yeah you're gonna you're gonna have to hire a you did if one you've got to hire someone to run that i need a chief of staff i hate that title i know i find that so douchey no you need a ceo of tanya now maybe yeah um i always love i always love these like silicon valley ceos who are hiring an assistant they're like i need a chief of staff like i'm the president that's so ridiculous yeah they should just replace themselves um and then the second thing that you did which might hurt you but you'll figure your way out is you painted the picture of yourself as this guy who's like what are you guys talking about like so easy why you work so hard like and now that you're doing it everyone's gonna be like told you told you well i think the way i describe it is when you okay so when you look at other people's businesses and you've hired uh executives or you've let's say let's say you own a bakery right and there's there's you're looking at a bakery owner and they're [ __ ] staying up until two in the morning baking they're sleeping for four hours they're working the till they're covered in flour and you're looking at them and going dude it's so easy just go hire a staff and build a manual right like this is not rocket science and then you do that and now you're the ceo of the bakery and now you got to deal with people problems in a different level of of issues and to me it's like i've done the right stuff and i've hired great ceos i have all that it's just now there's like too many different things to keep tabs on in my brain and i think humans aren't designed for thinking about more than like two problems at once no so when i have like 10 problems or 30 businesses it's just hard to kind of feel on top of everything i think i don't know i what i learned i think i learned this from you actually and then another person was like i was like oh i'm just gonna let this burn and oftentimes it doesn't it yeah survives or gets usually usually they figure it out right if you don't respond to the text and you take four hours to respond instead of 10 minutes usually it's like oh actually i figured this out or you train people that you don't respond quickly unless it's an emergency and they go figure it out but if you jump in and you solve their problem all the time they're just going to keep asking you yeah and i i kind of came to the conclusion of like i'm just going to let it die and then it goes it goes back to that thing of like you know tim ferriss or any of these people who talk about these hacks the hacks are real but what's what's what's also real is human nature is to be miserable right so like you know you know old people who are like rich retired and they're angry about their neighbors or their grass or their vacation got canceled or whatever the silly thing is and you're looking at it you're like dude you have a nice life relax enjoy yourself i think humans just always need something to be upset about and so for me it's like you know i've got i've got i'm so happy with where i'm at and i i love all my businesses but i managed to still make myself miserable i would change it too we don't need something to be unhappy about but we need a war i need a fight i there i i agree like it it's good for me to have a fight i love uh having an enemy but then i think i'm a double-edged sword i'm the same way my business partner always says you need an enemy um i i get so fired up with that or like being wartime ceo but then like okay yesterday i did this viral tweet i got the biggest tweet ever right how many people did that reach 30 000 likes i haven't checked the number of people i think is uh it was like it was like tens of thousands or something of retweets right so one of the pieces so shawn's clubhouse thing reached i think six million people but your thing looked like it was even bigger where do i look does twitter analytics yeah on your phone there's this thing called insights so you go to the tweet and then underneath the like button like the heart button you see something that says view insights so i got 7.2 million impressions wow and total engagement of 1 million 1.1 that is 7.2 million is so good yeah so it's crazy so anyway so i did that and you know it was like dopamine hits i was talking about a failure right it was like i hadn't really talked about it i publicly revealed i lost 10 million dollars on this business i'd started and it was just kind of like exercising a demon right hey i'm just sharing this [ __ ] horrible story or whatever and the thing about twitter is that two to five percent of your audience will always misinterpret what you say go you know oh hey technicality or this isn't right or you're you're trying to come across this way and that's not true or whatever it is it's a classic so how privileged of you totally oh how privileged you lost 10 million dollars or whatever it is and and i had it was it was hilarious i had um so my the story was basically we started productivity software called flow i decided to bootstrap it like base camp and we had a big competitor asana and asana was run by billionaire the co-founder of facebook he raised a shitload of money and originally i was like oh no we've got a better product and then they just made their product better and they outspent us on marketing and we we got killed right and so i do this and you know the co-fou the co-founder of asana who i really like and i thought i complimented him in this story he started taking issue and saying you know in 20 we didn't even have a marketing budget in 2012 and all this stuff and then was fighting with justin dustin was like fighting with me on twitter and i'm like dude i like you yeah you're like i like you i'm complimenting you you're like such a nice guy and and you said it really nicely and all this stuff and so he's in the tweet you said dustin very nicely said we're gonna crush you and he did and um but i love him a lot that's what you said i didn't really he didn't even say i'm gonna crush you it's more like hey here's all the challenges you guys are going to have you should really join us and we'll do this together right it was this very collaborative message because i think they wanted to buy us but um and then you know my other he like a hero of mine david heinemeyer hanson who like i've worshipped forever in terms of like their business they've built um he wrote this whole post about how i'm pro-venture and i'm you know mis misallocating you know success to all this stuff and he totally twisted what i was saying and so it's like this downside of twitter and being public of like starting a fight and stirring the pot and sharing what's going on like your buddy yeah and i'm friends with him we're texting about it and it's fine but it goes back to like the negative emotions of sharing and being out there and having you know having enemies comes with shitty emotions right and i'm debating this right now like is it worth over the last two years like i love coming on here and stuff but is it worth having a public profile right is it is it worth the negative emotions i think that that this is like a rich person's problem it's kind of not like not en rich of whatever you want so like whatever you're trying to get whatever you're trying to achieve you get it and you're like uh man that's not as good as i thought and i've experienced this as as well so if you've noticed like online i've actually try to be far more low-key than ever before because um i find the pressure and i find the attention to actually be a net negative although that's like [ __ ] it's like that's a shitty thing to say because it's not really a net negative because i'm happy with the outcome and i wouldn't trade it so it's not really a net negative but uh i completely agree i think that right now well this is the question is could you be known could you still be outspoken in audio and stuff but just have your photo nowhere so no one knows and not reveal too much personally or whatever because the the cool thing as an extrovert i like lit up when you're like oh dude i i tweeted this out and 50 cool people showed up at this event right like that is the power that's by by not being public you actually aren't a you're not sharing your lessons and you're not helping the next generation of entrepreneurs and stuff but you're not connecting with new people and you're making all these friends as a result maybe you don't need new friends but uh that's so cool yeah so there's we have two options one we just have thicker skin and stop being such a wussy um about it which like is hard it's really hard um or we build anonymously a little bit more and we're actually having what's this the guy's name biology the uh cryptocurrency yeah he's going to be on the podcast in a couple weeks i think right abreu and um he uh his whole he's got this big prediction that um that's going to be the norm is that your co-workers are actually going to be anonymous and i want to i wanted to talk about that because i kind of agreed i think there's a world where that could happen it's fascinating to think about like if you think about like if you had a work persona and you're just like you know sam x and then your sam pardon your personal life and sam x has a reputation and you talk about what you're doing and stuff that's super i mean there's that guy the samurai whatever the [ __ ] the guy is i'm a big fan financial samurai you like that guy no one knows who he is right or what's the guy's name mr money mustache nobody knew who he was until that new york times profile right that's the ultimate totally and and you and i both probably you you and i were this and you probably have a lot more we have friends who we feel like they're incredibly close friends and you've not only never met them in real life you've actually never heard their voice or seen their face i've had a ton of friends like that uh who i only communicate with and i know what their profile picture is um and i consider them to be great friends um but even even liquid jack smith right it's like his username is jack smith but his photo is just some random cartoon thing and it's it's fake and that is smart right like dude there's i was texting with someone last night and he was saying there's a twitter user i think he has like 200 000 followers or whatever the guy gets death threats right and i look at his twitter and i'm like this isn't like this is pretty innocuous he's not like some a controver i can't say but not super controversial or anything like that and the guy gets death threats and you just go like wow like if that's what you're dealing with like i remember i had this guy six years ago um a schizophrenic guy in my city thought that because we worked with apple we had the apple watch before the apple watch came out he thought we had the apple watch plans and he showed up in our office in like a super manic state quivering and like demanding with his like fist spared that we give him the apple watch stuff right and we're able to cool him down and get him out or whatever i have like some schizophrenic uh people in my family who knew how to deal with it but you think about like that's only going to happen more as you have a bigger and bigger presence and that kind of stuff's a little freaky right you don't want to get like john lennon i i call it love knifed you know they love you so much they're going to stab you um really and it is fearful uh i mean i've not had death threats but like there's been times where sarah and i have been on vacation and we'll take the picture of take a picture of our guesthou or the vacation home and we'll um cover the address but still but i'll get like five or ten packages um from people saying like oh we just found the house on street view and they'll like send away they'll send stuff yeah it happens all the time so i'm not uh that's creepy they asked me not to take pictures of the of the house even if we cover the address dude that's super creepy and i'm a nobody you guys you and sean have two x as many followers i mean and so yeah it's weird it's so it's so interesting that's so it's it's it's a it's such a first world problem right oh no i've got this big audience all these people listen to me or whatever but but uh yeah double edged sword yeah you know people always say that's a good problem to have that's a first world problem and my reply is like yeah you're right it's still a [ __ ] problem though totally it's very real and you know i was saying i was on the phone with someone uh the other day and you know he he was saying um oh yeah you know i want to be a billionaire and i was going well think about being a billionaire you know think about the pressure of having billions of dollars and knowing like you can okay so like here's an example it's like i read bill gates new book about climate change right and i'm going oh it's okay i don't have enough money to really do anything in this right i don't feel any personal responsibility let's let the crazy billionaire bill gates or whatever deal with this and if i was a billionaire i'd be going oh [ __ ] you know i need to like call bill and i need to help and i this is my problem now and if there's a shooting uh you know in town in town i need to fund the police to make it better to solve these problems like there's a lot of pressure that comes along with large amounts of money and so it's it's interesting to think about who's what's the right amount of money right and i i the people i admire the most are often the people who have you know enough money in the bank that they can do whatever they want but not so much money that they can turn into wackos or stress themselves out what's that threshold of they can do whatever they want like what does that mean i think really it's like five in my city it's like maybe like five to twenty million bucks is enough to you know that's live a great great great life right you could obviously do a lot less but i could i can pretty confidently say that i think 20 is the threshold that you could live a great life in pretty much any city for the rest of your life with 20 yeah i think i would say that now i mean that's like you could get like a crazy apartment in new york live like a king and you're you're good forever forever right but i mean in with like two million dollars even three million dollars you can live somewhere in the world like amazingly well yeah well um andrew thank you we'll do it again next week and we'll um get our research to do stuff i brought you what do you give this out of 10 9 out of 10. oh i'll take that that's good i would not have expected that you

they're not doing anything and so i give the presentation to the sleeping duke of york for the first 20 minutes oh my god how crazy i i was so lame i just that's actually really cringe well i'll i'll finish the story with one thing because it's kind of relevant to what we do so at the end because we were in idea lab and like this podcast about brainstorming business ideas and talking about shooting the [ __ ] about business ideas so we i basically paused at the end and i was like okay i could keep going but like it would be more fun if you actually joined us in doing what we do and kind of brainstorm some business ideas and so we asked him a bunch of questions we're like do you guys like what apps do you guys use and he was like we don't have phones like what he's like he's like we don't get to use our like personal cell phones i guess at that time i didn't know exactly what he's saying but there's some limitation where they don't have they don't just have like iphones with normal apps and they can do whatever they want it's like very like pre-installed use this phone use what it has and like if you want more go to it and they'll they'll help you or something like that and then i go what business ideas you have he goes there needs to be a fact checker so politicians can't lie i was like what he's like we need to hold politicians to to what they say there's so many politicians that just lie and we need them to and everything should be on the right everything should be like on the record it'd be fact checked at all times it should be public if you're lying that was his idea number one and then he had something else i was like about like i don't know like digitizing paperwork or something like that and i was like all right thanks prince so there's actually wait i could riff on that there's this thing called politico politica uh what is it uh i actually don't know how you pronounce this oh god everyone makes fun of me for not politico no uh polita have you ever heard of that no um so what it does is it looks at uh like when there's a big um uh big election they analyze all the major speeches uh done by some by someone so in the case of trump or uh biden when they were doing their debates they would they have a meter that is says true mostly true half true false i've seen this pants on fire and they actually check all the stuff they say and they say this is or is that true here's why and it's kind of cool uh uh politifact i guess it's called it's by the way i like that it goes to panto fire that's a nice thing that's pretty cool um i like that uh so your your boy was on to something not a great business but it it does there is something that does this right um um okay wait one more thing you said uh we got on this tangent because you said jake paul is coming on wednesday so um why is jake paul coming on and what are we gonna do about it so jake paul okay so uh i am basically copying sean and i started investing in some companies and jeffrey wu is a friend of mine i think he's a friend of yours too uh yeah i'm mildly close friends with him and he saw that i was investing and i saw that he was investing and he goes and we were just shooting the [ __ ] i go what are you doing and he said what are you doing we exchanged ideas he goes hey you just want to do a phone call i'll bring on my partner jake and i was like oh are you partnering with jake paul he goes yeah yeah i'll bring him on and uh i go all right sounds good so we just do a zoom and i'm sitting there with jeffrey and or jeff and uh jake and jake's like hey what's your cell let's just have a text chat like a group uh thread and uh by the way uh i love my first million and i know the hustle like can i come on the podcast or or i was like yeah sounds good so here we are it's kind of weird but kind of funny that's pretty legit uh i also want to know from him well i'm going to ask him but like jeff is like a tech founder sold the company uh started like a company backed by andreessen horowitz it's like a keto company and um and then somehow somehow like partners with jake paul i don't even know how they became friends it's like how did this asian dude from the tech world become like good enough friends with jake paul where they'll start a business together like do you know that no i don't i know that jeff moved miami and jeff's like a manly man like jeff's into guns and fighting and big muscles and whatever men are supposed to be into and like jake i i assume is also into that stuff so they they must have met and jeff's real real smart and savvy and i have a feeling that it's a good stick which is like jake's the famous one gets access and jack is uh jeff is the straight man who uh you know makes make sure the uh knows how to do it yeah and that's historically a great partnership it's actually there's this guy named brian lee who does this and he's partnered with uh shapiro i forget shapiro's first name but shapiro was the lawyer for uh oj oj simpson and they started legal zoom together and he and shapiro was like the celebrity and then he did it with uh kim kardashian and they started shoedazzled together wait weren't car what was it kardashian's dad uh kardashian's dad was the lawyer uh well oj had like eight lawyers robert shapiro is his name oj had like eight lawyers so it was like kardashian it was uh johnny cochran it was uh uh uh whatever yadda yadda and was was he the one who also partnered with jessica alba for the honest yeah so this guy named brian lee uh i guess he's korean he's a korean-american um and i guess lee's korean i think and uh he partnered with shapiro for legal zoom and shapiro was supposed to be like the faith and the famous person turns out shapiro i mean he's a really successful he's a savvy business guy so shapira goes let's do this with some more celebrities so they partner with kim kardashian and they do shoe dazzle which raises a bunch of money but i think kind of flamed out uh but then they do it with one other company and then eventually they do it with jessica alba and honesco on his company and it's the same thing jessica alba was supposed to be like shapiro kind of like the face the famous person turns out she's pretty savvy apparently uh and good at uh you know whatever whatever it is she's good at i guess running a business i don't know what her role is but she's great and that's what he does uh and so partnering with celebrities can actually work out quite well this company is a that's a big company that's like a that's like a big that's like a billion dollar company i think uh the honest code i think i think what do we want to talk about today i got a bunch of random random topics uh do you want me to start did you have one you wanted to start well i actually was researching a fair bit of your things um because i found them to be a little bit interesting do you want to talk about turned yellow is that interest or how about you lead i'll let you lead everything and i'll follow but i researched all your stuff okay we can talk about turned yellow so we'll start there um this is a cool business so this is in a category that uh our friend ryan beagleman said this word he was the first one i ever heard say this i don't know if he started it or he picked it up somewhere but it's the term drop servicing so people have heard of drop shipping which is basically like you market on facebook or wherever else you sell a product to a customer but it's a product that you don't hold in inventory you as soon as you get the order from a customer you place an order with your manufacturer the manufacturer ships it directly to the person so it's a way to do ecommerce without having to buy and hold inventory because you're just directly shipping to customers straight from the factory and typically kind of like lower margin but it's a great way to get started if you don't have any money in e-commerce that's kind of like the idea turned yellow is actually one of jack smith's uh favorite things jack might be an investor but i uh i know he's a huge customer of turned yellow right so what turned yellow does is similar it's a drop servicing company so instead of shipping your physical product they do a service for you kind of on demand so turned yellow or actually a friend of ours um i don't know if you know the guy alex uh who's behind it but uh he bought the company recently and uh i won't share any like the numbers or anything like that but uh alec too really uh volor volodarsky or something like that volo is how you start the spelling of his last name um you can find him on twitter he's at volod dark or something like that and he also started this like 90s theme kind of like uh party or parade or thing that used to happen like 90s jam fest or something like that was just all nostalgia which i thought was cool that's why i first reached out to him and then i found out that our our mutual friends xavier and sieva helped you know invested in him when he bought turned yellow oh so sorry it wasn't jack it was sieva i'm i'm an investor in cf is fun that's how i heard about this yes okay exactly so what turned yellow does is they basically it's a great gift so you can submit a picture of your family or your friend and they'll send you a drawing uh like an illustration of that same photo or that same person turned into what looks like kind of like a simpsons character like turned yellow like you know all the sims characters are yellow so they make they cartoonize any picture for you so it's like you you went and got this custom made for your friend so it's this great gift and um simple simple business they basically on one side they have a whole bunch of artists who can crank out these like illustrations in this one art style and on the other side they just advertise on facebook or whatever and their their number one advertisement is this like uh picture of howie mandel holding up his turned yellow where he got turned yellow and that probably millions of dollars there's so many replicas so if you keep your ads on and type in turned yellow so there's turn yellow.com which is i guess i i think the original then there's simpson simpson phi me then there's art of yellow and they are all complete total ripoffs the exact same website practically and uh that's kind of interesting i would have thought this would would have you would have had to have had some type of licensing or blessing from citizens i think it operates in a slightly gray area because they don't say anything about the simpsons but the art style does evoke that idea that look and i think that's part of why people are buying it for sure it's one hundred percent the simpsons i mean they're sitting in front of the camera he's my friend so i'm trying i'm trying to say it a little bit softly here so but anyways the cool thing what they were doing was they bought the company the company was doing well i had all these competitors because everybody was kind of doing the same uh everybody was still trying to clone them um and then they brought on this badass licensing guy who has been like in the licensing business for decades and the idea is that he was going to go and actually talk to all the different ip holders of uh simpsons and futurama and harry potter and any other brand and basically say hey we would love to cut a licensing deal with you so that we can do this and do it like totally above board you make some money from this we we lose a little bit of money but we can kind of like knock out all these competitors who are doing this and they don't want to work in the aboveboard they all want to be under the table here and so that was the business plan and um i don't know exactly how it's going now but i thought this was really cool it's a cool business that does uh you know very good revenue and there's a whole bunch that are like this and right now what people do is they just do this for every popular theme so it's like you can do one like a lot of people like rick and morty that's like a cult phenomenon now so people are doing this with the rick and morty art style and then people are doing this with another art style and this reminds me of what our friend uh silly did where he got the rights to family guy and made the family guy mobile game and he made he made a version of candy crush that was themed family guy so he took a proven game candy crush that's like super addictive amazing at monetizing and he just skinned it with the family guy branding and got family guy to help promote it and family guy got millions of dollars in revenue from the success of this game and then eventually the same thing with harry potter yeah he did the same thing with tons of stuff but how do you think you even like i wouldn't even know the first thing what do you do do you find someone uh who happens to know someone who knows someone and they introduce you to someone at fox i mean like i don't even know that seems really hard to to make happen yeah well i think that's why they brought on a guy who's done decades of licensing because he has the connections already he maybe worked with these same brands to do a different licensing deal maybe putting faces on t-shirts for bud light or whatever right like uh so i think that's one thing is like there is a network aspect to it where you can get your foot in the door but i don't know did you ever listen to the first episode of this podcast with suli where he explained how he got the family guy rights no i mean insane story yeah i listened to the episode but that was uh two years ago now happened yeah basically he was like all right uh first why did he need this they were just making normal mobile games but distribution costs kept going up and up and up because facebook was getting more and more expensive to advertise on because all the game developers were all competing as each other bidding the prices up so he's like [ __ ] we need a way to stand out we need a way to acquire users without paying for as much in ads we need a more efficient way to acquire users so he had seen that the simpsons did a mobile game with ea and they made like simpsons like the quest you know i don't know what it's called like some simpsons game with ea he's like oh that's genius that's what we need to do and this is before the kim kardashian mobile game and before others started copying this playbook so he's like okay what's the next franchise that we can get family guy so family guy is also owned by i think fox yeah and so they have they have simpsons and they have family guys they go to they they get in touch with they you know google around they get in touch with the person to who who's in charge of the stuff and they're like yeah like okay i don't know i've never heard of your startup but um we're gonna probably just go with ea i mean we just did the simpsons with them it was pretty successful like ea is like a big name trustworthy you don't get fired for going with ea i might get fired if i go with you guys so they're like okay you know fair enough but they didn't give up and so what he said was every he had decided like the company was screwed if they didn't find like pull a rabbit out of a hat so he just put all his chips into this one strategy and was like okay every morning when we come into the office we just have a whiteboard the whiteboard says how do we go get the family guy rights i was like what can we do and uh they would just come up with some ideas and then they would try it that day and then they would like fail and they would come back again the next day and like the next day and then eventually his number two it was only him and two other people who knew about this plan in a company of like 50 60 people i think and so the number two guy was like dude we've exhausted we've we tried this we tried this we you know blah blah blah and so um eventually mark andreessen was on their board he was their investor so they had asked mark andreessen hey do you you're super well connected do you know know the guy he said yeah i'll make a phone call so he makes a phone call they get the meeting but the meeting again is like i don't know guys so he says all right how do we pull this off he goes first we're going to economically make this like a ridiculous deal for them so like we're gonna offer them this ludicrous upfront guarantee of x millions of dollars of you just get that money from day one uh number two you're gonna get this like awesome fat royalty on the back end uh if this game is successful and um so that was kind of lucrative and they were like okay we're into that and by the way he didn't have the money to make like he didn't have the money to give them yeah promised it and was like i'll go raise the money if they say yes was his plan and um and then the last thing was they found out that the guy the main guy who's the decision maker his like mentor or was like a family friend of marc andreessen or something like that and so he's like oh talk to the mentor guy so they talk to the mentor the mentor is like okay guys i hear what you're saying i like your spunk like um i'll i'll help you out and they put them on the board of their company they're like dude we'll give you shares we'll put you on the board and he was like guys don't need it it's okay and he put in the word and basically that that got the guy to like lean their way of like yeah give these guys a chance they're legit don't worry about like that they're not a big household brand in fact these guys will go all out for you it's life or death for them and that's what you want in your partner and so that's how they ended up getting the pitch to work and got the rights to family guy and saved the company do you ever think at least i i mean i think of this and do you um when i think of stories like this i think to myself like why wouldn't you just go to this person with the job and just be like and just say all the obvious which is dude you don't want to get fired you also hate your job uh i'll give you a hundred thousand dollars personally how why are you 100 grand can you please just like like what's stopping just like total cronyism i mean i guess not what's stopping it maybe i should rephrase this it's pretty mind-boggling that that's not more like there's not more of that so okay so let's let's answer both what's stopping it well usually the person you want to bribe is in a pretty high up position so they're doing well already maybe hard up for money maybe how much do you think the person makes a year who's like in charge of licensing for a family guy yeah i bet you not i bet that guys i bet you that guy's easily pulling in 300 400 000 okay so that's not stupid money but that's good money good money right so he's not like you know he's not desperate let's put it that way second thing uh you know in a big company i don't know if you've had yours yet now that you got acquired but there is like a whole like anti-bribery training you have to do they really put it in your head like hey look even just like taking any gift over 50 tickets to a game you know a dinner you need to report it it could be bribery blah blah so you get it it gets put in your head and you start to think okay do i want to risk it all because if i actually got caught doing this i would basically not be able to have a career anymore so you kind of have to pay me so much that i'm i'm willing to risk the odds of me getting completely blacklisted from my profession where i've worked so hard to become a vp after 30 years and i'm not saying that's like i'm not saying by the way i'm not even remotely implying that i'm into this i'm just saying i'm actually of course you're saying some other guy might be into this what i'm saying is i'm surprised that this doesn't i'm surprised it doesn't happen more it's just crazy that we all agree that with uh we we mostly all agree what's right and what's wrong and we kind of stick to it um because like if julia would be like look man i'm gonna give you this deal if you get fired i'll give you a job um right but i'm gonna pay i was gonna pay your company 10 million dollars i'll give you just a million of that i'm shocked one is somebody said this the other day they go so how many employees does amazon have how many points does facebook have how many players google have huh i wonder how many foreign spys work at these companies a lot it's like it sounds crazy like foreign spy like what is a movie it's like no no of course it's not zero like of course there are people working for china for russia for different countries as foreign agents and there's actually been like cases of this where guys basically took the you know like the machine learning model out on a usb stick out of google and like basically went back to russia or like that's like a thing that has been has been found um to be happening in these companies so one is it's crazy that that's actually happening that you know i've probably worked with somebody who is actually like a foreign agent which is just like a bizarre agent on behalf of google i mean how many times do you think that there's someone who is a facebook employee and they're like hey look i'm gonna fire you and we're gonna act like we're not friends anymore i need you to get a job at snapchat and i'm gonna funnel you money and exactly you tell me everything everything yeah that totally exists which is everything that has to happen we don't talk about it so then so okay so then um then i was exactly that so i've had this experience where i thought honestly i didn't think anything was wrong with this but again this is where maybe my moral compass is a little screwed up but i was like oh for example when we got acquired we had talked to five other companies while we got acquired and for each of them they're laying out their map you know how what's their strategy how they're going to win how we fit into that strategy you know where they're strong where they're weak what the numbers are so when we finally got acquired i was i walked in and i was sort of like guys congratulations you got me you got my team you got our code base but you also got a little bit of intel no they right like i talked to they had no interest i didn't even say anything but i was like nobody asked me anything that's insane i and i was like i know i would if i was in that company's shoes and i acquired somebody who had talked through the strategy with the ceo of all these different companies i would run like so like what they say what do they plan like what how do they view the world well that's not even for like most people tell me their secrets it's just like what were they saying it's like not it doesn't even seem wrong to me but the fact that nobody asked me tells me huh maybe they do think that would be wrong to ask maybe my compass is screwed up what do you think well this is my whole point which is mo and and i just want to say this again incredibly clear like i'm not saying i do this or support it i'm just saying i'm surprised it doesn't exist but the moral of the story is most people are actually quite ethical and particularly if you're in a room full of people they're going to be extra ethical um and so i know i'm not surprised that they didn't do that and i told you but as an owner i would have been like hey come here what uh yeah exactly i wouldn't especially when i was like at a startup i act but i wouldn't start if i have nothing to lose and i have everything but i wouldn't say like tell me their numbers i would say like i would i would just be like what do they like what motivates them um are they cool do they seem like they have their act together like these like fluffy questions and then okay i can say honestly i totally would have asked for their numbers i would have been like how big is it how much revenue are they doing i i was guessing you know 500 million is it 500 million you have to ask those other questions first you got to like see if they're going to bite them you got to see if the person's cool with it or not yeah you want to make them uncomfortable but i am a bit i am surprised um we uh you and i know someone who was involved in a lawsuit because they were hired at one company a large uh tech company and previously they had worked at the competitor and yeah we could we could say the names this is public information all right it was um anthony popliano he worked at facebook this is all public this is you can read the deposition or i believe it's deposition he didn't tell us i read i read the deposition like a nerd and that's how i know yeah and basically according to the records that we read he worked at facebook he decided to work at snapchat and they said something like here's a piece of paper write down the um the organization chart tell us how it works and then go and recruit those people and he according to the uh deposition said no that's i'm not a chance and they fired him snapchat did or or they like butted heads or something like that and uh so yeah i do yeah they putted heads over that yeah i i think this stuff happens actually a fair bit but i'm actually shocked it doesn't happen more right i i thought my only concern in that situation would just be i don't want to make my own person my teammate uncomfortable if they don't feel like sharing they don't they don't want to share they feel like that's wrong okay no problem then um but if they were down to share i would 100 be asking all the questions i'm thinking from my startup brain at a big company you sort of have more to lose it's not really worth it uh you're not like in a like sort of you know life or death situation of the company like you don't need the information but i really have been surprised like we will hire people who are like from youtube or whatever and they and wherever we're at we're like hypothesizing like well you know like how do other companies handle this blah blah blah what can we try i'm like that dude worked there why don't we just ask that guy like hey dude what did you guys do how did it work what was it like is this retention number good or bad relative to what you saw like and nobody asked the question which is like maybe it's just not in the big big meeting settings but uh i have been surprised at that and i know if you're working like overs there are other companies that don't have that same credo i worked for a guy in indonesia my first first job i ever had it's kind of like a summer job and my dad hooks me up with this guy he's like oh yeah this guy is known as the king of coal in indonesia he owns like all the coal of indonesia i'm like oh sweet okay so i'm like i go do the summer job with this guy what's it was he an american or an indonesian he's a chinese guy living in indonesia a fifth grade dropout can't speak like any english pretty much like very broken english um i he had four women just doing his email on giant tv screens in his office because i don't think he could even type and uh he was just like or he would like uh orate like he'd just say out loud what he wants to reply to every email and uh and that's how we do his business and so i like as i get there i'm like oh cool you're the king of coal like how'd that happen what'd you do and basically what i realized pretty quickly was this guy's entire business model was big companies like exxon and bp and chevron they all wanted land in indonesia and the land was owned by the local uh like city province they had the rights to it so they so they had the thing and um the local guy would just only like the only way to do business with this guy was to bribe him like that's the only thing the guy wanted was a bribe the local politician wanted a bribe if you give him the bribe you can have the land rights and this chinese indonesian guy was a politician no he was the guy he was the middle man so what he realized was um because i was like okay cool we have this coal what do we do with it he's like oh we just sell it immediately as soon as we sign the paper we have the call we sell it to exxon and i'm like oh okay so how does that work he's like well i bought all this coal for two million and then we i bought all the coal for two million and then we sell it in blocks for 20 million each i'm like well that's like 400 500 million how are we we're turning 2 million into 500 million and he's like yeah i'm like well what that's amazing like why didn't exxon why don't they just go in directly by this he's like like well if they could they would but they can't so they won't and basically what he was saying like those companies did couldn't get their hands dirty they could not risk bribing foreign like politicians so what they did was they let this guy bribe the follow-up foreign politicians get the rights and then they would cut a commercial deal with him and this guy knew nothing about the coal like i'd be like oh is this a good asset bad asset he's like doesn't matter we get the paper they pay for the paper like we don't have to do any of the work we don't have to like extract it mine it don't have to do anything and now by the way this guy's a jail like you know that's the the end of the story is he's in jail yeah his name well i i don't wanna personal risk personal harm by outing this guy you know we're a world away but but this guy's kind of a gangster so i'm not gonna say his name but you could you could use what i said in google basically your dad got you an internship with a gangster yeah me and my sister by the way both of us that's crazy like i remember we were we were in his office one time and he had a friend come in and his friend is like kind of like you know when it's his friend because it's just like alcohol like starts pouring women start showing up at the office like what's going on here who are you trying to wine and dine and it's this one sleazy looking dude and i was like oh like what's what's your business he's like i work in singapore i help companies on the singapore stock exchange and literally this was just straight insider trading so i'm sitting there and i'm just hearing this guy be like yeah these are the three companies you need to like buy they're like dirt cheap right now but they're gonna like they're about to announce xyz and they're gonna pop and then they would just like toast their whiskey and then they would buy this stock on the singapore stock exchange or hong kong stock exchange and like sure enough the numbers would go crazy and i was just sitting there being like wow this is like insanity that this is how like loosey-goosey these guys are with business well what i was gonna say was i think that like in uh uh even though like people make amazon or whatever to be like evil uh you just said no like we would never even ask this ex-googler about x y and z and i was going to say that's like a very american thing i've have a couple friends who i worked with who run chinese companies or you know they're chinese and they're either based in china or are now american or the chinese american now and i have a bunch of indian friends um and they're like yeah we we don't we operate differently than you our opinion of the right and wrong way is a lot different than you and it is far more unadulterated capitalism of just uh what why is copying wrong like and and they're kind of right right like why is it wrong but in any way it is quite interesting yeah totally uh anyways i don't know how we got you want to talk about the first versions uh we can go back to yeah what is i saw this website um my guy chris chris who's my apprentice right now for content he sent this to me and i haven't actually spent a ton of time on it but go to firstversions.com uh check that out and i'm pretty fascinated with this i think you are too we both are like internet archaeologists we like to go find the og thing what did i did this blog post i got like tens of thousands of views once uh before i had any audience it just went viral because it was what did the first web page look like for these 10 big companies and this is kind of like some common to to do uh like uber's homepage back in the day snapchats home page back of the day the first facebook home page uh the first ebay homepage first amazon homepage and these things look like you know so basic and rudimentary and like really just it makes you realize like dude you you need to launch and there's that quote if you're not embarrassed by v1 of your product you launch too late and all these companies definitely like fall into that category so i thought firstversion.com was a cool little like archive of stuff like this i think this is so cool so i actually just sent you a link to an article that i wrote i think i wrote this in 16 2016 years ago uh 15 october 15. and i you could it probably doesn't even work entirely but anyway i what i love to do and i've always loved doing this is i use there's a few different websites web archives the easiest and what i like to do is i will [Music] get a google doc in a spreadsheet and i'll map out the the whole journey of a company so i'll look at where when airbnb started and then i'll read all about them of like all right here's when they announced they had this many users here were there here's where they announced this much funding here's where they said they had up their first 50 employees and then from 50 they actually went to a thousand in only two years and then i'll take screenshots of their website and in doing that you can actually see what like how the the evolution so progression yeah and i'm just starting i'm just making this up with airbnb but it could be like it started as air betting breakfast and it was about renting cots inside of a living room and then oh wow they actually changed their their positioning to travel like a local and they started um taking higher end pictures i don't know what it is but uh and when they started actually taking higher end pictures that was actually right when they right before they raised their 100 million dollar funding and so anyway you can actually track the progression really nicely by doing this and i love doing that i love it and so you can actually see oh uber ubercab.com they were only black car services oh when they raised all this money they actually got rid of the black car the black car became secondary so actually the black card didn't work uh so they switched to this you know what i mean so it's kind of cool yeah you can totally reverse engineer a lot of the stuff so some of the tools we use to do this the wayback machine which is the internet archive so uh just google wayback machine that lets you put in any domain name and you go back in time and they took screenshots of what the website looked like on june 12 20 2010 and then that you can go back you can see uber's what did who uber's homepage looked like back then how were they describing themselves another one i do is techcrunch i go to techcrunch i search for a company's name and then i reverse sort it by the earliest mention of it so like you can go twitter you can see the very first article is you know mike arrington being like you know the buzz at the party this week uh was about twitter spelled without the you know without the vowels basically it's like the short messaging service it was kind of fun you do do this but you know who cares you know people are just tweeting about there they're just tweeting about their breakfast and it was all through sms like you could kind of see what was going on then so i like that one that's that's a useful one another one i'll do is i'll go on twitter and you can twitter advanced search so you can type in anyone's name and you could do things like uh twitter doesn't make this obvious how to do it there's like a format of how you write these in but you write like at the sam par before 2011 and then you say minimum 300 likes and i can kind of go see your most popular post at that point in time what were you talking about what was working for you what wasn't so i've done this with a whole bunch of people and i kind of like i really am a big reverse engineer type of guy it's not that you can copy it but it's just data points it's a way to fast-forward experience because experience the hard way is slow it takes like decades to get good at things and to learn and to like figure out what's normal what's not what's fast what's slow what's good what's bad and a better way to do it is to like download a whole bunch of data points quickly and it's not perfect experience but it's better than being blind and just kind of like going off only your personal experience so there's some ways i would actually go as far to say you can copy it um you you can you actually can copy a lot of stuff and i think you should sometimes so for example this first by the way firstversions.com this is a wonderful website this is such a good website uh i uh this is so cool um i wish they don't by the way what they do is not just internet like what like what we're talking about is home pages because that's like kind of our niche but they'll be like this is the yeah this is the first version of tom and jerry like the very first pilot and like last night i don't know why for a reason before i went to bed i was watching the very first pilot episode of curb your enthusiasm before it was even a show and i was i just love seeing that og og the first pilot of always sunny in philadelphia where they're using the handheld camera like i like seeing that because it just as somebody who is frequently starting things it's important to go see that your favorite things started with very humble simple kind of shitty beginnings and uh and then you know you sort of can see how much better they got over time this is so good uh i love this uh i'm gonna link you some uh link something to you so in 2013 i created this thing i called uh the ceo doc it was a stupid name but uh i i sent it to you and you can actually see that it's so funny that you do this because i mean we're it's it's so funny that we're similar and we've been doing this for years so i created oh wait is it not working um i created this document where i would take i think i had a list of 500 people and i would make timelines for each of their lives and i would say started their it was broken into apprenticeships first hit and then the self-actualization mode so for example uh jack dorsey started apprenticeship at age 22 from 22 to 28 he basically was like this poor nobody who worked as a dispatch service for taxi cab company 28 to 31 started twitter at 28 uh it actually became a pretty big hit really soon at uh 29 and so i have timelines and i have average ages a average age for each person and so um i love doing that stuff and it works so good uh for for just seeing like what's possible um right so we're actually quite similar uh i've been doing this as well for a while yeah it's great to nerd out about this kind of stuff um okay so first versions is cool i have another kind of cool thing okay here's a here's an idea i would say this is not a business it's probably a very bad idea maybe this is something that this is you reminded me of it because this thing that we're doing is uh like the thing we're talking about is extremely nerdy and probably most people don't don't do what we're describing like kind of like go back and map out the evolution of companies or people or whatever it is so similarly i i want a tool that i'm calling business pocket so pocket is this chrome extension it's this app or service where you like if you see an article you like but you don't have time to read it you just hit pocket and it's like you put it in your pocket for later do you think i think it used to be called read it later you think pocket is going well i bet you it's going pretty badly i bet you that'd be a cool company to buy yeah i don't think it's going well it got really big and it raised a bunch of money and then like it's just been around for so long without like an exit that you wonder did it just get like become obsolete somehow um along the way but anyways it was just a way to save articles now i actually want something what i'll call business pocket so i have this bookmark thing in my chrome that's called companies to watch it's based like any time i stumble across a company i find it interesting i've been doing it it's like this thing is like 10 years old now i find an interesting company and before it used to be i want to see if this will be successful or maybe i should if i was an investor i would invest in this so i want to like flag this and then i'll come back later in three years and i'll see how it turned out whether i would have made money or lost money on this thing and so i've just been collecting this for a long time now in reality i hit i bookmark it and then i like never go back and go recheck those because who's got the time but um i would love a service that's almost like a programmatic newsletter where i can just flag either people or companies that i say i want to keep a watch i want to keep watch on this company or this this this individual and um like the ceo or maybe this company the startup and then i wanted to like basically take the 10 that i've flagged and send me anytime there's interesting news about them with some filter like you know they raise new funding they got a new job they they they announced this thing they're on tv whatever and um and you know my 12 that i'm tracking might be different than the 12 that you're tracking but like we might have three that are the same and so this company that's underneath that would just need to set up like a kind of like a programmatic way to like watch for the news around certain names and then turn it into an automated newsletter that was kind of just like a random idea i don't think it's a business but i think it would be i disagree i think it's a business when we were getting ready to decide if we wanted to launch trends or watch launch something new i wrote a landing page for this product i forget what i called it but something involving the word spy and i put like the headline was like we're your secret spy spies that track your competitors and tell you everything that they do so you know and we deliver to you via email and uh i think this actually could have worked wonderfully and the reason i came up with this idea was i had a friend who worked at rocket internet rocket internet google it it's a it's a guy it's three brothers uh named ali alex and something else samware brothers and they started this thing called rocket internet and basically the way it works right now it's a large publicly traded company they had this like guy named he was like the chief scientist and what they would do is they would research fast growing companies in america and they would clone them and they would deploy that company in africa in asia different parts of europe things like that brazil and so they cloned uber but in mexico they cloned pinterest but for germany they cloned zappos but for germany they did um amazon for time they owned like the amazon for brazil i think yeah and they also owned the amazon for thailand and they would pick a variety of companies they would do like the wayfarer for nigeria or something like that and they had this guy who's who was called the chief scientist and all the clones of the amazon of this country that country that country there'd probably be like eight clones and he would send an email every day this is the story i heard i don't know if it's true he would send an email every day and it'd be like hey everyone amazon uh actually just moved on their homepage they moved the clothing from uh eight pic or a hundred pixels to the left uh it probably means that clothing is a little bit more popular now than furniture so all right make sure you move your clothing thing or hey they uh they changed their color of this button from this yellow to this orange go ahead and do that and i thought that's pretty awesome i would love to have that i would love to track my competitors because i would do research on my competitors i would say oh which ads are they using oh i wonder why they're using this ad maybe maybe they're using this ad for this one this reason that reason and that reason i'm gonna go and copy it and i would use a variety of similar web uh facebook ad archive uh aha refs and a few other things and i would i would just i would like oh here's where they're succeeding and here's why they're succeeding i may copy them i may not copy them and i just i just know what's working and i think that that 100 could be a service that you pay a hundred grand a year for and you get and you and they'll tell you the five nearest competitors and every month you meet with their team and you say all right your competitors they're doing this they're doing that they're doing this here's what's working here's what's not working right here's a higher pi hypothesis hypothesis as to what what all this means and i think actually you could charge a six-figure annual contract for all of it and i think it would be a really cool company right yeah i told you about my friend who i i nudged in this direction to do this for for e-commerce uh i'll give him another shout out here he said he got a bunch of sales last time i mentioned it so i'll do it again shopify sales data.com basically a way to track your competitors um who and how much they're selling and what new ads they're running and stuff like that and um just in the niche of e-commerce and it's you know i don't know 100 bucks a month or something like that and um i paid for it i'm like this is a great uh you know it's a valuable service and so you could do it in a niche or you could do it you know more broadly but uh but yeah i think that's cool um let's give you a different topic you want to do one more did you want to do the pets thing you've had that here for two weeks um so this is actually like a really what i thought was a really random idea and then i saw an ad i saw a commercial for it on tv yesterday and it's like totally a thing so it's just going to sound stupid because it was like a stupid basically i was like uh kids love having pets pets are like a pain in the ass maintenance wise and your kid wants it but they're not going to maintain it i was thinking about like that's why people get fish because it's kind of like self-contained in this little tank and you don't have to do anything most the time just feed it a fish die all the time it's really sad for the kid and so i was like why is there not just like ai pets why aren't they just like robo pets um for kids and i was like oh a fish would work because it just needs to swim around sort of aimlessly you don't touch it so even if it was mechanical it wouldn't feel cold like a mechanical dog i don't think will feel great but um dude that is you know mechanical fish you you hit home runs this is such a dud this is such a dud you you're a home run hitter today's a strikeout this is a stupid stupid idea you are well i saw the commercial before it was called robo fish yesterday and i was like oh this exists no way oh my gosh so i'm going to go check everybody see if you can see does robo i think it's called robo fish i saw the commercial tell me to do 100 million dollars a year and prove that this is not a dud so anyways that was one and then there's a related one which is there's a medical thing that's going on for you know like pets are sometimes labeled as like kind of like a emotional support dog or whatever it's like anti-anxiety that sort of thing you know that's total [ __ ] too right well i know most people use it for [ __ ] i don't know if there's any medical like uh like there must be some like cases where it helps or something like that no i agree that in some cases it is true but um a lot of like like people like oh they're certified and emotional like there's not like a certification process yeah there's no yeah exactly this dog did not get trained um but but anyways i saw this company that was doing this with for for people with dementia and alzheimer's they were giving them this weighted it's the equivalent of a weighted blanket but it's a pet so it's a pet that sits in your lap it's heavy and like a weighted blanket but it feels like a pet and it moves like a pet now if you're like totally if you're just like an adult who's has no health conditions you'll be like oh this is like clearly a robot this blink is like not really fully natural and you know this dog's obviously not running anywhere it's not a real pet but to somebody with you know dementia or alzheimer's they found that this like is extremely comforting to them now they're really expensive right now uh they're like thousands of dollars for this like really kind of like realistic feeling thing what's it called but um but they're gonna bring the price down i don't know i met this guy who um through my wife she she was consulting for this company that was doing it and she was showing me the videos and stuff like that about this thing so i thought that was kind of cool too but i think that we will see more and more either genetically engineered pets or just straight up kind of like mechanical ai pets because if you can get sixty percent of the benefits with zero percent of the work and maintenance i think there's a whole class of people who take that trade um that today just don't own pets because it's just too much cost and too much work so man i called your thing totally stupid i think for the average oh yeah hold on receipts come in and tell sam tell sam about the robo face i mean i don't know if this is what you were talking about but this company in 2012 they sold 15 million of these at eight bucks a piece in their first year well first year that's right all right i i'm both i kind of take back and i don't take that so you're wrong in that you're saying like oh pets are so annoying just give them a robot pet like yeah i think that's actually silly i don't doubt that people buy a robo fish i think that's just like a cute little widget that's fun to have but dude you were the one who was like oh these ai girlfriends are great uh it's the same idea it's the same premise okay well look i'm open-minded enough to like uh challenge my views but i you started talking about this alzheimer's thing and that's actually quite interesting i just googled it i wanted to see which ads come up i like because like so i googled this thing i'm i it's kind of i don't really like looking at this i feel a little sleazy but there's this oh i actually don't like the name there's a name called i just sent it to the alls all store so alz store and it stands for the alzheimer's store and they call it the all store and they sell um like these live strong bands that have your name on it so if you can when you forget your name remember and they actually have a robotic therapy dog and this website actually looks like it's like a entrepreneur who's just looking for a money-making niche which a little weird with with this type of thing but people seem to love it it's a whole store dedicated to alzheimer's products i have zero idea if this is like actually what alzheimer's patients love and need but this is incredibly fascinating and i'm looking at their similar web traffic no i actually think this is legit they have videos of them of the founder talking on like the today's show about selling all types of products for alzheimer's stuff and i'm looking at their uh similar web traffic and it's incredibly popular what a fascinating business all about alzheimer's yeah i know this is a legit uh company i'm looking at the about page this they have a good background story of the the father has alzheimer's so now they create all these products it looks pretty interesting can you believe that this exists the all store right that's wild i had no idea um but makes sense i guess uh i guess that does make sense i have one more can i do last two minutes billy of the week story um the second billy of the week story i learned this i tweeted this thing i tweeted this out and it kind of this kind of blew my mind okay so i was doing some you know shoe dog is like super popular about the founding story of nike yeah you did one on adidas i did one on adidas and as i was like okay nike great uh what's the story with adidas where did that come from and so i just started googling for a second and i didn't go so in-depth but okay here is the 60-second version of adidas so fir uh tell me if you knew these things just give me a yay or an a if you knew it or not so adidas when you were a kid did you not hear that this stood for all day i dream about sports yeah soccer all day i dream about soccer soccer yeah yeah that's right not true uh basically you know the guy's name was adolf dossler who started it and he went by adi dossler dude uh so it's just adidas i was in germany one time and someone a german was like do you like adidas i'm like i don't know what that is like a german brand they're like oh no it's adidas you don't know adidas goes no i've never heard of it and they started laughing at me that's adidas i guess yeah right i'm sure you corrected him i was about his own hometown oh you've been taking this yeah i know that's not i don't know adidas so okay so the story is kind of crazy so uh two brothers basically dad owns a leather shoe factory the two sons are like okay shoes are cool but we want to do sports shoes not these like leather shoes and so they spin out and they create the dossler brothers shoe factory and what they do is they're like we're gonna you know adi you're gonna design the shoes and uh rudy you're gonna sell the shoes you do sales and marketing two brothers they do that right uh it's like a ten-year grind you know building this thing up they're growing but they're growing slowly and then finally 1936 the olympics come to germany and um they are a whole bunch of the athletes from germany are wearing adidas but they also get a little bit you know they go and they hustle and they get their adidas shoes in the hands of some non-german athletes also one of whom is jesse owens jesse owens goes on to win i think four gold medals at those olympics and so jesse this is a black guy who basically wins gold and beats the germans in front of hitler who's like promoting white supremacy at the time and so it's a you know a big deal for for that victory um at the time he's wearing adidas and this is kind of considered the first time that an entrepreneur used sports to promote their products or their businesses and he kept doing this right like you see photos of ollie versus frasier they're both wearing adidas because he was like hell-bent on getting adidas into the hands of all the iconic athletes that they could which nike went and took that strategy and did even better with that strategy over time um and so they you know business is going great that you know after that olympics thing where they get all this exposure next three years they sell like i don't know 600 000 pairs of shoes business is great uh you know 1940 hits and world war world war ii starts and the factory just gets seized by the german military they're like this is now a war factory we need to produce war goods here no more shoes and hey you two brothers join the army so they they get enrolled in the army so the business just goes on break adidas just like goes out of business for the whole world war okay world war ii ends the brothers come back uh you know andy's like all right he gets 50 people together he's like we're restarting the factory we're going to do this again and somewhere along the way the two brothers break up so i didn't know this part yeah i know that the other brother goes on to start puma yeah and so one brother starts adidas the other brother starts puma which i just thought was like you know the most baller [ __ ] you knew that already yeah i know that they got an argument well known yeah uh well i don't know but i mean you're talking to me uh i think that uh yeah they got into an argument one of them started puma for some reason i thought that he he like did he move to africa and start puma is there any part of that no i think he like literally moved across the river and like started a competing factory within like earshot that's that's the way i read it maybe i read that wrong yeah i knew and and the two brothers because they got into a disagreement on how to do oh uh bray said reebok started in africa so i guess i'm getting confused but uh yeah yeah i knew that so they they restart the factory after the war and now they're using all the war like leftover war materials in the shoes like rubber for the souls and like certain design like the look of camouflage and different things like that they come up with the three stripe logo and so anyways business does good and then like there's this crazy run of death so the puma brother dies four years later the adi dies you know from adidas he dies his wife takes over she dies six years later the sun takes over he dies three years later so this is like this run of early deaths it's like you know the defensive against the dark arts position nobody can like hold this thing and so that finally now the two daughters have owned the thing they sell it for pennies on the dollar because adidas has just been declining for years now at this point you know they didn't have the right people running it i guess and so they sell it for 500 million dollars um uh you know to this french guy french guy tries to turn around he can't do it it's on the verge of bankruptcy and then they sell it to this guy this is the actually the billy of the week uh it's this guy dreyfus and um i think his name is robert dreyfuss oh do you know who you know who this person's related to right no uh his dad was rich but i don't know why he's rich uh i believe it's elaine from seidenfelp that's her uh uh julia dreyfuss yes i believe uh i believe that's her grandpa wow okay that's crazy so this guy grows up kind of rich goes to like harvard or whatever uh buys this thing his tagline i love it he goes i'm a gambler and i like turnarounds that was kind of like his business philosophy so he takes a gamble takes the lead role at adidas and he basically is like all right we're doing three things we're moving the factory to asia we're cutting the payroll we're cutting jobs cutting two-thirds of the jobs in this company so we can get profitable and lastly we're gonna take that money we were spending on people and we're gonna spend a [ __ ] ton of it on marketing and you know they were like wow you know you took it from the brink of bankruptcy three percent market share and it came roaring back and became the number two brand how'd you do it you know you must be a genius and he goes you know he was in time magazine the quote is it didn't take a genius you just had to look at what nike and reebok were doing and do that he goes it was just easier for somebody outside the company to see what was obvious than somebody inside the company who had all this baggage and they couldn't do it and uh you know so he he turns it around retires a billionaire you know in his 50s i think and uh and that is you know the crazy story of adidas today i thought that was wild i had no idea so there's two takeaways of this for me um the first is a question that i should start asking myself and and you don't actually need to follow through but how would a pe firm run your company i actually think that's a great question to ask yourself which is what would a pe firm do if they were if they owned this right now and that's kind of an interesting way to get ideas because you kind of say to yourself oh man i'm being such a punk like i could be so much better the second thing and and the opposite and the opposite would be what would you know larry page do groups of google's you know ceo and founder or doc um yeah like but yeah they took this small thing and they just kept expanding it like no we need to do google x we need to do moonshot projects self-driving cars you know satellites into the sky giving people internet like they had like unbridled you know ambition and were like what if you just like blew the top off this thing in ambition and then the other one is the pe the ruthless operator way what would they do i think both are valuable questions for your business and the second thing and this is actually something that i've been thinking a lot about because i've been thinking about louis vuitton uh not that i don't even own one louis vuitton thing i'm never gonna own all the louis vuitton thing but it's pretty fascinating that i in my head i stereotyped fashion brands it's just like trendy and and they they're gonna come and go like uh but in reality it i would bet that some of these fashion brands like adidas puma louis vuitton they're actually some of the longest lasting companies i imagine i could think of and that's pretty fascinating that a brand like adidas that went through near bankruptcy went through multiple owners is still relevant in kicks ass and that's actually pretty cool to create something that can last that long and uh right it's kind of cool i think that's actually inspiring that something uh with withstood all that nonsense like it succeeded in spite of especially in fashion especially in fashion where everybody wants to do it and fashion like literally is kind of like in and out of fashion it's like a fad type of uh type of business where things go in and out of style so quickly so just to last there is pretty impressive what i'm saying is there's some stuff that it just it has lasted for many many decades so uh louis vuitton luggage i i imagine existed at the turn of the century in the 1900s same with um the uh um right now i'm wearing nike cortez i just looked at the uh the website that we were talking about earlier first versions and the first version of nike was the nike cortez and i'm still wearing the same damn model and it's kind of interesting and inspiring to create something that can last 50 100 200 years and uh that's kind of a cool part that's how i feel about like altoids or coca-cola yeah i guess you could do it i mean you can do it a lot more than fashion but there are a bunch of fashion brands that have done it successfully and i think that's pretty damn cool you know like uh rolex or tiffany's diamonds or something like that it's kind of neat i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in never looking back

so i'm in the same boat uh the question is directed towards you but i'll give you my answer really quick which is sean how do you balance side hustles while performing at twitch my answer to that and i've said it before is um i don't ballot i don't do anything on the side um and frankly i have no idea how you do it our good friend ramon is able to do it really well i get some people can do it i personally can't do it and i don't even try and uh i'm not ashamed about that yeah yeah there's different ways to like kind of organize your time like you see this from elon musk or jack dorsey running two multi-billion dollar public companies at once as ceo right like kind of a crazy thing that kind of seemed impossible before and i would say i do it two ways one is i throw more hours at it so like i don't take weekends off like i work seven days a week i don't work all day all seven days a week but i my weekend is just like my weekday they're the same construction so all of a sudden i got an extra 16 hours on the weekend where i can do things same thing at night like i don't watch a bunch of like tv i stopped watching like you know nba games stuff like that like i basically was like look i can cut that out and that's two hours a night that instead i can create content right or like when i do the podcast everybody else at the back when we started this everybody would go down to the cafeteria at twitch for lunch i would walk across the street the studio was your office was literally like 50 steps away from from twitch i would walk 50 steps away go to the hustle office we would record from 12 to 1. everybody else has eaten lunch i'm recording a podcast cool i'll eat lunch on my desk like later it doesn't matter right so there's these little pockets of time you can unlock that's the first bit second bit is hiring i bring on people so when i say i'm doing x it's rarely just me doing x it's like ben or zack or romine or chris or i have a whole bunch of people that i say hey i'm doing this interesting project who wants to do it with me and they're like i find great people who want to do interesting things together and i say cool what's in it for you do you want money do you want learning do you want like rep you don't want to build your network what do you want out of this i'll make sure you get it and they let me like i said be in two places at once because i could be doing this and they could be doing that what's your burn on all the like because whenever i hear you say you got all these people i'm like damn yeah that must be a lot uh monthly yes my burn is expensive it's expensive but the things now bring in money so it's it's okay it offsets it but like uh but the angel investing doesn't bring in money and that's not angel investing i don't pay salaries it's only carry so it's splitting the upside so they have they they get they i took some of my my 20 carry and i took it down and let them have more carry so um which you know for them is fine because they make money doing other things so they're like cool this will pay off in five years that's great and i get to like learn a bunch about investing i get to put together a portfolio so if i want to go get a job doing this or i want to start my own fund i'll have a track record to point at and say no i i did these investments before i've been doing this for years so that's kind of what's in it for them um so i do have a you know significant burn i would say it's like 200 to 300 000 a year of like people cost to do these things my goal is for them to break even but if not like that's what money is for money is to be invested in things that will grow and so i kind of like just look at it like an investment and uh it's worked out so far where the side hustles more than pay for the money i put in um now the last thing is basically an acknowledgement and i talked i was pretty transparent with the people at twitch which was like look i operate not on a nine to five like strict schedule like cool i'm just gonna punch the clock for 40 hours a week no no uh i'm here to do this mission you want this job done great i'm gonna get that job done here's the trade i i can make sure this job gets done you don't ask me how and when and where and why and how you know like all the time uh like not in such a like confrontational way but like it's an understood agreement like they know what i do i'm very open about like hey i have a podcast i have a newsletter like the ceo of twitch subscribes to the newsletter and like will dm me about it like sometimes right like i'm not hiding any of these things they know i do these things they know they take some time but they're okay with that trade because i deliver the goods in my projects and so uh my trainer told me this one day because i told him i said i'm feeling a little bit guilty like you know i wonder i really like these people i don't want them to feel like i'm shortchanging them he goes well do you deliver the goods i was like well yeah like i perform like they get the results they want okay well you're that dude and i was like what do you mean he's like he's like they don't pay you to sit in your chair for certain hours they pay you to deliver the results and so just make sure you deliver the results and if you're delivering the results in less time that's because you're that dude maybe not everybody could do that but you could do that and i was like oh man what a pep talk that was uh you know made me feel good about something that i was feeling you know uncertain about or uneasy about before and you're on paternity leave now right yeah so that helps too yeah exactly yes and that's you know like big companies understand like look you if you have a kid my first kid i only took 10 days off which i really regret i should have uh i should have took the whole leave and so this time i decided i'd make i'm gonna make sure i take some off and this time my family actually really needs me there whereas the first time i was like i don't know what the hell i'm gonna do here uh my wife's kind of got it under control let me go back to work and so this time i kind of realized that the idea of like oh this project is so important and like if i take this time off then you know let me do it i'll take time off later and later never came and that was a big lesson for me like don't don't put important things off till later do them now i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like travel never looking back

you would know more than i am but this guy's tim and his brother i i'm not that close with them i'm friendly with them i'm friends with them but i'm not that close like i if you told me that they were worth over 150 million dollars i wouldn't be surprised and they still act like they're poor in kind of a funny way which i enjoy and they're they're super humble and they're like super hard still and they invest in everything i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to today we're gonna answer a bunch of questions uh but did you see trunks tweet about the guy selling the card no what is it trung tweeted out this video that he found from probably the 90s or probably from the 2000s early 2000s and it's a guy uh who's got like who's like trying to sell you on his like business card that's a big square and you open it up and it's a pop-out and he's just really intense but the video got it's funny you haven't seen this no oh well this won't be any good then but the video got like half a million views and people are making websites uh about the tweet or about the video based off his tweet it was just funny do you see half a million views now or like he tweeted something that already had half a million views no it did now oh wow trung is a master of uh finding great content that guy is really good i have this like apprentice who's working with me chris for uh content he's been the red head guy yeah yeah he's like kind of like shadowing me and he helps me produce my content and and he's learning as he goes and um i told him i was like you know success is being trung so like that's the level that's the top bar um that's that's what you need to measure against here's five examples of like awesome things he's done and so he called trung he was like what's your secret what's your process basically drug was like oh you know like i kind of browse the internet a lot and you know there's no way you can you know it's like asking michael jordan how do you jump so high type of thing like it's not it's not easy to describe how you do the thing that doesn't feel like a real process for you you know you're just doing it native intuitively he's a machine one time i called him at 11 o'clock his time he's in vancouver and he was at the park playing with his son and i was like trung like i'm not trying to like get on you because i'm not your boss but like don't you have work to do like and he was like bro i bro i got up at 5 am and i already wrote tomorrow's email already i was like all right sounds good okay it's a machine so i didn't see this video is it worth talking about given that i didn't see it or what it's too long to go through basically okay people and myself let's go to twitter after this and let's go to trung t fan i think is his uh handle and look at his thing and he the funniest thing that he's done lately is he owns onlyfans.com dude that slayed me it was so funny so he has only fans but he spells fans p-h-a-n like his last name and it's just a network for only people with last name fan and i just thought that's so funny for some reason it's funnier than when i think that he came up with it yeah now we don't like it so much all right today we're gonna answer questions i uh we got uh it looks like we got like six pages of text questions so like dozens and dozens of text questions and then we got a few dozen uh audio questions like people calling in but uh some of the text questions were good i'm gonna start off um i'm gonna start i'm gonna read a few that i think are cool let's do the first one this guy's name is uh johnny volcky asks what are you both personally investing in right now by the way do you know johnny volk do you know who this is he i talked to him on twitter and he's joe spicer's buddy he lives out here in the bay area he lives like you know 15 minutes away from me he super successful e-commerce guy been an e-com for 10 years sold his company recently like i don't know a month ago or something for tens of millions of dollars and he's a big investor in my rolling fund and several other rolling funds and uh really like ultra nice guy so this guy's super legit so he's asking what are you both personally investing in so you want to go first i think you uh yeah i think you're interested your answer is probably more interesting i'll go first so right now the bulk of my liquid net worth is in publicly traded companies um i own a bunch of hubspot right now i own a bunch of airbnb besides that i don't own anything else above 50 000 uh it's all in um so you're super concentrated in those two companies basically yeah but then i have more money in the s p 500 so like the total stock market index um i have i'm going to invest around 250 to 500 000 uh in the next probably 18 months in startups uh i had i owned six figures worth of uh into a variety of real estate funds including sweaty startup nick hoover um and then i own um my house uh and i'm in the process of buying multi-family properties so i would say i have like if you just broke it out you're like perce you know roughly you're like okay 70 is in the stock market really in the two companies you know where my wife works and when i work something like that no i i own way more just sp500 than i do hubspot and airbnb um but i would say that uh ninety percent of my net worth is in the s p 500 yeah oh wow okay so just like low low low cost index fund basically vanguard fund simple stuff and then my goal was to invest somewhere around one to three percent of my net worth over a period of time into angel investments gotcha uh cool and then some real estate mixed in real estate being you know the house you live in and some other you know projects other people are doing you're not currently buying and like owning real estate at the moment uh i'm going i owe my house but i'm gonna i want to buy 16 units i also have i mean i'll say like half a million dollars in cash just sitting in a checking account um which i think is too much money but uh i when i bought my car i just paid cash out of there and then i um i owned six figures of uh bitcoin and ethereum of which i owned most of that bitcoin from 2013 and i just bought like 75 000 worth of ethereum like a few days ago because you and a few others told me it was interesting nice uh by the way we got some criticism constructive criticism i would say which was like oh the last few episodes uh feel like you know rich guy's talking about you know ways to make a bunch of money which um honestly good description for the podcast but but i get what the person's saying because they're like a fan and they're like that's me raising my hand because i think i basically was like oh this [ __ ] thing is cool and it sounds like a total ponzi scheme and so people are like what are you or we're talking about like jack selling like a nft for like 70 million dollars so it just sounds like a little bit crazy um so i think you know although i think your answer is great because i like knowing how people invest their money i think it's most people are very closely guarded with that info people don't tell you what the hell they're doing so you're kind of on your own to figure stuff out and you don't really have any data points triangulate because all the wealthy people don't want to talk about what they're doing with their wealth unless it's with other really wealthy people and so i think it's great you said that but i'm also as you were saying it that was just ringing in my head of like some guy being like why are you guys just talking about money but it's like well that's also the theme of the podcast in a way and that was also the question i'm trying to answer it truthfully but also when we started this podcast when you started this podcast a year and a half ago or two years ago it really wasn't a bunch of rich guys talking about it was a bunch of hopefully soon to be rich guys talking about stuff and we've been talking about the same stuff the whole time yeah oh you mean us yeah yeah yeah cause yeah and also i put this out there in the manifesto when i started this thing which is i i think it's unfortunate that talking about money and how to make money and what you do with money to make how you make your money more uh earn you more money i feel like it's unfortunate that that's taboo um to talk about like it's like kind of like a it's like kind of like low class or something to talk about because look the reality is most people want more money um and people try to signal and say oh it doesn't matter and all this stuff i know a lot of people that want more money most people in my life if i had the option would you like more salary or less would you like more in your bank account or less like the answer is more and if if all the people who have money are really guarded and don't talk about it and don't want to seem like they're bragging well what that really does is it kind of like just traps the information from others so that's kind of like my overall view of it i know you're similar because i remember being kind of stunned when we first became friends and you just facebook messaged me you're like um like how much do you make it's like whoa whoa bro like what's going on here but i was like okay you know ballsy question the reason why that i actually dislike that view that's or if someone criticizes you for about money it's because they are making the assumption that because you have money or because you don't you are somehow better or worse and in my opinion like i don't just because you have money i i that's you have no intrinsic value to me like you either are interesting or you are not interesting and what makes you interesting to me is that people are just they try ambitious stuff and they do neat stuff oftentimes that's correlated with money but it's not always like i knew this lady who would do these amazing art exhibits where she would like paint gold phones and like just do interesting stuff and i was like wow that's super badass that's so bold of you to try that she wasn't wealthy at all but i thought it was so cool right so to me it's about uh just being an interesting person i don't really care if it's money related or not but oftentimes it is right for me i have like three or four different uh life games that i'm very interested in like let's say right now i'm interested in the fitness game and i'm a total beginner i'm a white belt at the fitness game and so i have a trainer he's like more like a black belt you know look at his body look at his lifestyle he's extremely healthy and so i want to learn about the fitness game i like learning about the happiness game how do you be like a happy person how do you control your mood how do i master my mood i'm really interested in that i think about that a lot talk to people about that then there's like the money game and then there's like the making things that people want game and i like all these games and i admire the people who have done well in them and i'm better at some than others where i'm like a total beginner and in some i'm like you know a blue belt or a purple belt where i've done something but i'm by no means at the end so anyways that's a tangent but uh to answer john's question did you want to say something else about that no i answered to answer john's question uh i'm kind of similar i i tweeted out my like holdings a while back maybe i'll do that again i need to go back and recalculate but i tend to hold about 10 of my wealth in cash um i think cash is being devalued and i don't want to hold cash cash doesn't earn you know cash sitting in the bank is nice for a rainy day but it doesn't earn you more money um right the 0.001 i get from wells fargo or whoever is not going to like help me um i have a good size stock you know basically i would say beyond that it's almost like 50 50 of public equities so stocks um and you know crypto right now and uh i and oh and then angel investing so i'm angel investing currently through the rolling fund four million a year but that's not my money uh that's mostly other people's money and i get a carry on that i get a 20 carry of the profits so that's kind of like investing but i'm not investing my own money there and i'm looking at real estate right now but the problem with real estate for me has always been a i'm a beginner at that game and b um i don't want to sign up for more work so i'm looking for ways to get real estate that's i directly own but i don't have to do a ton of work and those two are kind of uh at opposites with each other i don't invest in other people's real estate funds right now has your uh net worth or like your total portfolio increase a significant amount since your deal because it seems like you've like weren't very active before and now you are very active and has that helped you it has increased because uh you know the stock stock market's been doing amazing last few years and then with the deal you know like where we when we got bought the amazon stock price was 18.50 amazon stock price today is 3 100. so just while working there you know you get pretty significant gain in your holdings there and because we got bought like a large chunk of the rsus were just in that one company so that did well uh crypto bitcoin has done extremely well ethereum has done extremely well so those have like really worked and then um kind of like the side hustle money from podcast email newsletter stuff like that um sponsorships that sort of thing has been really nice so that that's that's actually picked up as well where i wasn't doing that before um so i'd say yeah but i would also say um what really changed was my attitude like i just started acting like a guy who's got 100 million bucks for better and for worse like i take like bets that are kind of too big for my bankroll sometimes and that's a risk and i you know might pay the price but i sort of just started carrying myself and acting like and basically making decisions like what if i wasn't worried about money what if i wasn't worried about you know going from a to b you know like what if i just knew that i'll get to b pretty much regardless how would i bet if that was the case and so i started making slightly larger bets and just being more active uh whereas before i was a little more conservative with how i was investing which is a huge difference in our philosophies i'm way more conservative than you way more conservative um and uh i don't think i was telling to bray you he was like because i told him i started angel investment he was like who do you think's gonna have a better portfolio and i was like that's kind of interesting and i and the answer was like my answer to him was i think my portfolio has a higher chance of being pretty good whereas sean's portfolio has a higher chance of being amazing or zero right uh yeah i think that's true that's that's definitely true i i guess like the style of who you admire sort of dictates what you do what blueprint you create so like for example i was really inspired by like chris sacca's approach to how he went from like you know he's like me he's like a bit of a degenerate gambler like he went you know he took like his law school money and then like was tr day trading in the stock market during the dot-com boom wrote it up to like a 10 million like took 25 000 and turned into like 10 million dollars and then went in the whole four million dollars like that was like a crazy degenerate gambling run if you haven't heard me talking about my bets in crypto and you know i used to play poker like i'm obviously i have a gambling problem also right and so you know i have that risk and reward profile but then the other thing he did that i thought i was pretty inspired by was he you know he bet on somebody who he believed in which was ev williams when he started what became twitter and then when he saw that it was a winner he like went all in in a way that most people do not most people would have let their 25k check sit and been really excited and fingers crossed i hope twitter becomes a thing he likes started he quit his job basically started showing up at the office every day being like how are we going to make this thing grow i want this thing to grow he went and personally was fundraising for the company even though he wasn't even a part of the company but he was out there pitching investors to invest in twitter and then he ended up buying billions of dollars of twitter stock uh before it went ipo and was their i think first or second largest shareholder at ipo and made billions of dollars off of his twitter holdings because he knew when you have a winner you got to go all in so what i've seen is in technology the winners get really really big and so you kind of want to like play small bets initially and then follow on really hard and like when you see something that actually works be really bold uh in the way you approach it and like hey if you strike out i i kind of just think about it like this i have a lot of faith in my skills even if i went to zero today i think in three years i'd be right back where i want to be we're right back where i am today so like i don't feel like there's a huge risk in terms of that but anyways that's a little bit off topic for one question all right let's do the next one which was a question that i actually have for you as well update us on your rolling front fun is it what you expected are you more or less bullish on it it is not what i expected in that i didn't really think too much about it before i started it to be honest which is you know i'm kind of impulsive i was just like oh yeah that sounds like a cool idea let me try it and see what happens but um i thought okay i already angel invested this is just going to be that with some bigger checks or you know do a few more deals um but i would say now that i have to deploy a million dollars a quarter i actually have to carve out more time i have to like consciously go and invest in more companies so it's it's more work than i thought initially but uh i brought on romine i brought on zach ben helps me with it and so they do a lot of the heavy lifting like for this week's this this year's yc batch you know zack himself referred in 22 of the companies he was the number one i think referrer into yc so he knew a bunch of the yc companies before they even got in we looked at those deals and then romine basically and him went through every single deal on an air table vetted them made a list of the interesting ones did meetings with them and then brought the like most interesting seven to me and were like hey we think these are the ones to do and so that that like i've been able to handle the additional so it's more work than i thought but i found really good people so that's helpful who's this guy zach zack is a young engineer he was a yc founder himself that company didn't work out he currently uh so i met him because he listens to the pod or i don't know i don't know how he reached out but he's like hey i heard you're thinking about rolling fun i'd love to help i just want to see a bunch of startups and help a bunch of founders while i think of my next thing and uh and it just turns out he's just like super well connected with the like young founder community and so because of that he's like referred a huge number of people into yc and into on deck and uh so he's got this really great network and he's like able to like see things earlier than most and so i brought him into the fund and and uh gave him a chance to hey now you can have some upside in this in this thing that's badass um and then are you more bullish or less um more yeah like the same i don't know i was uh i have a friend we have a mutual friend sully who uh he wanted to get involved in a business of mine and he goes he said he texted me something because i was like i was like kind of i don't know is this i don't want to give up equity but like you know um i think you're worth it uh yeah so so basically he goes um he goes look uh if i try i win and with this i'll try and uh and so i just loved it i was like i'm just gonna learn a lot from this guy's philosophy and business he just has a zero of the doubt and fear gene i think that's a new experience you would know more than i am but this guy's silly it's him and his brother i i'm not that close with them i'm friendly with them i'm friends with them but i'm not that close like i if you told me that they were worth over 150 million dollars i wouldn't be surprised and they still act like they're poor in kind of a funny way which i enjoy and they're they're super humble and they're like super hard working still yeah and they invest in everything so these guys are interesting they're two brothers yeah and silly's the same way actually when i first met him i met him at you you hosted the hustle con dinner at my office this is how crazy the world works this is like one of those you can't connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them when you look back you reached you cold emailed me saying hey i want to host a dinner at your office i didn't know who the hell you were but you made a strong pitch you said i'm going to have all my speakers for my conference there you can you can you know meet all of them i was like all right fair deal you can use my office at that dinner i meet suey sue's now my best friend we've done tons of deals together you know like that wouldn't have happened if i hadn't said yes to something that was kind of a random thing that's funny at that dinner i was like dude this guy's amazing i've never heard this guy's name before why don't people in silicon valley know this guy so i started googling him i find the story that back in the day he sold his he had this company that was like building facebook apps and he sold it for not a ton of money but like you know good for any normal person like two million or three million dollars between one and three million dollars kind of what it sounded like and uh and so and then what did he do with the money he was like he had been building on the facebook app platform so he had been seeing that like his app was growing really quickly and his app wasn't a great business it was like you know those like silly facebook apps but he's like facebook is not silly so he basically took a bunch of that money and just pl he was like chris saka he aggressively started buying up facebook stock back then before it was public and then he did and he went to you know in florida and he bought a bunch of real estate and i just thought wow this guy's really like conducting himself i at that time i was just kind of like i thought of myself as an entrepreneur but i acted more like an employee like i wasn't playing the game to win i was playing with these like invisible handcuffs on me like i saw these companies that were awesome i didn't even go try to invest in them and like when i saw that this guy when he knew something was good he was like how do i take all the money i have and put it into this facebook thing i believe in this and simultaneously i'm gonna build my next business now you know right away and um and so i just really admired him and i thought that that was a great example to follow he's a hustler um and i like him a lot too let's go to the next question which is this is we'll answer this one quickly what uh do you not talk about or do we not have the chance to talk about because low priority or off topic that you wish you could talk about for me it would be i love talking about ufc um i'm a big fitness guy so i love sports i love weightlifting and i like running and i wish we could talk more about like uh fitness stuff but i don't think it's on topic and i'm not an expert on expert on it yeah if i could do a podcast shooting the [ __ ] about basketball or ufc that'd be awesome uh but nobody cares what i think about the nba or the ufc really um so that's one and the other one i think would just be like i do kind of bring this in sometimes but like it takes up a lot more of my life than i let show here on the pod which is like on the pod i'm just talking about a bunch of different business ideas ways to make money in reality i'm not just like doing that all day what i spend a lot more time thinking about all day is like my mindset so what is my life operating philosophy as i go about my day to be like the happiest and best person i can be and it's just kind of cheesy to talk about and like no one kind of gives a [ __ ] but like i give a [ __ ] a lot about it and i care a lot about it and i think a lot about it but i don't really talk a lot about it i do i think about that stuff too yeah but it is silly to talk about and it could be embarrassing particularly if you're still working through stuff right it's cool to talk about that i found when you're in a small group of people or you're in front of if you're in person with some people because you can get a sense for do they give a [ __ ] about this or not right and it's also like kind of personal uh on a podcast you you might record that thing for an hour and you're like i have no idea if even one person is going to like want to hear that or maybe they'll just all turn it off what's uh you guys are awesome at coming up with incredible ideas knowing how to execute them what would it take for one of you to pull out of twitch or i guess in my case hubspot now and pursue it full force that's actually a great question and i have a i think is a good answer um go for it which it which is um first of all starting a company is really hard and i've like joked but i'm kind of serious i don't know if i'm ever gonna do it again maybe maybe not right or at least like who knows what i'm gonna do you know i thought it would be cool just to like retire and not work uh and we'll see if that's cool uh or not i don't know but um i think that the answer far or the answer should be but it is not enough of i just think this is cool so like why are you doing this because it's [ __ ] cool and i think that when i find something where it's gonna be like oh this is badass this is cool like there's not like for me there's often not like a mission where it's like let's save the world or let's it's like ah it's just kind of badass it's just awesome like right there's not there is no logic other than this is this is this is cool to me and when i i found a few things that fit that but i'm still on a mission with hubspot and i want to make it great and after that then i'll pursue the next one i get i don't like doing what i think sean you do this a little bit and a lot of people do i don't like starting lots of little stuff i prefer to dedicate my life to something and i'm very cautious about what i'm willing to do that with because you probably can only do that three to four times in your life and so um there's a few things but i'm not i'm not finished with this chapter yet and that's why i haven't done it yeah that's a great answer i uh similarly i basically was like all right well what's this chapter of my life about and uh so when we got acquired i was like well i want them to feel like like glad that they did this acquisition you know what i mean like i want them to be like yeah that was worth it you know and for myself also i was like well cool this is like a transition let me like try this new thing let me work at a big company never done that before let me have this like big cushy salary type of thing like never had that before i was kind of just eating [ __ ] you know like doing my own my own startup like sleeping on kind of an air mattress before and so um so basically i was like all right if my 20s were about starting my own company and just trying to figure out how to be an entrepreneur what are my thirties going to be about and i've decided it was two things i said i want to you know live a great life like with my family so you know popped out two kids in the last like 18 months and so that that's actually like my project is being a dad and and having kids and spending time and just being there you know for that and not trying to be like oh i must because like you said now i know what it takes to start a company i know how all-consuming it is so you've got to choose wisely the second thing with choosing wisely is my 30s are about building a family and then it's building a project i don't want to sell which is basically like i totally agree how do i build my next thing same thing you said this is something i want to do i'm not doing it because it's the best business idea or it's the hot opportunity or whatever but uh what it you know some the thing that i just want to keep doing that i don't want to get rid of i don't want to sell it i just want to build it let it compound for 30 40 years and i love doing it and it's the thing i'm uniquely good at doing and i thought okay maybe i'll dabble in some different things to figure out what that is and i feel like i found it which is like ironic i found it where i wasn't looking i started this podcast for a different reason but i what i realized was oh i really like this thing where i can be kind of like perpetually curious like i could just be curious about the world i can learn a bunch of [ __ ] and then i just share what i'm learning and i'm kind of like a teacher and uh through the podcast the email newsletter through experiments like all access pass or i'm gonna launch some courses in the future like i my lunch school like basically i want to do things like that something that lets me just be really really curious and learn a bunch of things and try a bunch of things and then share as i go because that's what i would do if i if i let's just say if work couldn't pay you money how would you spend your time that's how i would spend it so might as well just do that as my work and so that's what i think i'll do next which won't look like a traditional startup or company and i agree with that uh i want to do something that i never want to sell um so i'm in the same boat uh the question is directed towards you but i'll give you my answer really quick which is sean how do you balance side hustles while performing at twitch my answer to that and i've said it before is i don't ballot i don't do anything on the side um and frankly i have no idea how you do it our good friend ramon is able to do it really well i get some people can do it i personally can't do it and i don't even try and uh i'm not ashamed about that yeah yeah there's different ways to like kind of organize your time like you see this from elon musk or jack dorsey running two multi-billion dollar public companies at once as ceo right kind of a crazy thing that kind of seemed impossible before and i would say i do it two ways one is i throw more hours at it so like i don't take weekends off like i work seven days a week i don't work all day all seven days a week but i my weekend is just like my weekday they're the same construction so all of a sudden i got an extra 16 hours on the weekend where i can do things same thing at night like i don't watch a bunch of like tv i stopped watching like you know nba games stuff like that like i basically was like look i can cut that out and that's two hours a night that instead i can create content right or like when i do the podcast everybody else at the back when we started this everybody would go down to the cafeteria at twitch for lunch i would walk across the street the studio was your office was literally like 50 steps away from from twitch i would walk 50 steps away go to the hustle office we would record from 12 to 1. everybody else is eating lunch i'm recording a podcast cool i'll eat lunch on my desk like later it doesn't matter right so there's these little pockets of time you can unlock that's the first bit second bit is hiring i bring on people so when i say i'm doing x it's rarely just me doing x it's like ben or zack or romine or chris or i have a whole bunch of people that i say hey i'm doing this interesting project who wants to do it with me and they're like i find great people who want to do interesting things together and i say cool what's in it for you do you want money do you want learning do you want like rep you don't want to build your network what do you want out of this i'll make sure you get it and they let me like i said be in two places at once because i could be doing this and they could be doing that what's your burn on all the like because whenever i hear you say you got all these people i'm like damn yeah that must be a lot uh monthly yes my burn is expensive it's expensive but the things now bring in money so it's it's okay it offsets it but like uh but the angel investing doesn't bring in money and that's not angel investing i don't pay salaries it's only carry so it's splitting the upside so they have they they get they i took some of my my 20 carry and i took it down and let them have more carry so um which you know for them is fine because they make money doing other things so they're like cool this will pay off in five years that's great and i get to like learn a bunch about investing i get to put together a portfolio so if i want to go get a job doing this or i want to start my own fund i'll have a track record to point at and say no i i did these investments before i've been doing this for years so that's kind of like what's in it for them um so i do have a you know significant burn i would say it's like 200 to 300 000 a year of like people cost do these things my goal is for them to break even um but if not like that's what money is for money is to be invested in things that will grow and so i kind of like just look at it like an investment and uh it's worked out so far where the side hustles more than pay for the money i put in um now the last thing is basically an acknowledgement and i talked i was pretty transparent with the people at twitch which was like look i operate not on a nine to five like strict schedule like cool i'm just gonna punch the clock for 40 hours a week no no uh i'm here to do this mission you want this job done great i'm gonna get that job done here's the trade i i can make sure this job gets done you don't ask me how and when and where and why and how you know like all the time uh like not in such a like confrontational way but like it's an understood agreement like they know what i do i'm very open about like hey i have a podcast i have a newsletter like the ceo of twitch subscribes to the newsletter and like will dm me about it like sometimes right like i'm not hiding any of these things they know i do these things they know they take some time but they're okay with that trade because i deliver the goods in my projects and so uh my trainer told me this one day because i told him i said i'm feeling a little bit guilty like you know i wonder i really like these people i don't want them to feel like i'm shortchanging them he goes well do you deliver the goods i was like well yeah like i perform like they they get the results they want okay well you're that dude and i was like what do you mean he's like he's like they don't pay you to sit in your chair for certain hours they pay you to deliver the results and so uh just make sure you deliver the results and if you're delivering the results in less time that's because you're that dude maybe not everybody could do that but you could do that and i was like oh man what a pep talk that was uh you know made me feel good about something that i was feeling you know uncertain about or uneasy about before and you're on paternity leave now right yeah so that helps too yeah exactly yes and that's you know like big companies understand like look you if you have a kid my first kid i only took 10 days off which i really regret i should have uh i should have took the whole leave and so this time i decided i'd make i'm gonna make sure i take some off and this time my family actually really needs me there whereas the first time i was like i don't know what the hell i'm gonna do here uh my wife's kind of got it under control let me go back to work and so this time i kind of realized that the idea of like oh this project is so important and like if i take this time off then you know let me do it i'll take time off later and later never came and that was a big lesson for me like don't don't put important things off till later do them now um who's the worst person this is such an interesting question clay bert uh i bet you i know who that is uh who's the worst person you admire [Laughter] do you have one for this yeah well like i it's a great question and it's you can get in trouble answering this one um i'm gonna tiptoe a little bit around it because it's just weird but i actually love learning about dictators um i like i read a ton about dictators there's actually a podcast called dictators so like i like learning about benito mussolini i've read a lot about hitler i've read a lot about fidel castro um who else um so i think i got in trouble with this before because i remember i was in school and i took a history class and the question i asked the teacher was look this sounds so messed up what was going on back then that sounds totally screwed up like how did this guy come to power and he explained like well here first you have to understand the state of germany at the time blah blah blah he goes the other thing was that like honestly he i forgot who hitler's second in command is but he's like kind of like a famous guy for like his almost like his persuasion prowess like his marketing prowess yeah uh joseph uh gib uh yes yeah he's like the head of propaganda he made movies exactly i forget his name he's not a famous guy he's like his number two guys the head of propaganda exactly and they did very simple things like everybody else was putting out like i forgot like their flyers when they were running for whatever present whatever their equivalent of president was was like all in color so he did everything in black and white to stand out or if everyone's black and white he did color like he just did a whole bunch of things and i found it really interesting like oh oh yeah go gobbles dr goldberg joseph yeah yeah joseph yeah yeah yeah yeah so so they had movies made and they used entertainment to kind of like get their message across get the story across they had like um a whole bunch of like this they distilled down their philosophy into these like really catchy nuggets and so there's all these things that i thought wow that's like if you just abstract good and evil away the skill of accomplishing a very hard thing which is like getting millions of people to follow you there's a lot to be learned from that and i kind of was like oh that's really cool and people were like dude you said hitler's cool like you're like you're awesome yeah yeah and that's that's the point i'm getting at which is like it's so fascinating that someone can convince and in my opinion like a lot of dictators i'm like man if they like just like move that early on like clicked it a few notches to the left and then that trajectory would have like put them in a totally different atmosphere i'm like man it like it but it is fascinating how someone can come from nothing and just create something whether it's an idea a business a piece of art whatever like i love that like idea of manifesting and even though it's horrible and the worst thing on earth and i wish they'd it never existed i always have been fascinated by like a guy like che guerrera or someone who like was just like or uh what's his name benita mussolini who i just read about like this wasn't like supposedly a poor kid and somehow he convinced all these people these to do all this horrible horrible stuff um and that like to me is fascinating how he just bent the world around him and like that's just crazy that hey people buy into that stuff and it's crazy that someone that he had the courage to do that which sounds like i'm glamorizing these people i'm not at all but hopefully you guys understand the nuance here and and why it's kind of intriguing yeah uh this is two things one um when i met i've talked a little bit about my friend vishal the guy who's kind of like a young guy who i'm like this guy's definitely gonna be a billionaire and he's also kind of like totally hell-bent on becoming a billionaire and he lets every part of his other life go like what we were talking about earlier where i was like well on the podcast i talked a lot about business and money but like in my real life i'm doing i'm really actually more passionate about these other things i spend more time on he's the opposite whatever he talks about here he's 10 times more obsessed with it outside of this and i love him for that and i remember when i met him he was he he was like send me this documentary about like this like warlord in africa who just like just like they get like the absolute like gang gangster [ __ ] this guy did he's like i love this movie i love this guy i was like oh it's kind of like heinous crimes you know he's like oh no it's crazy they told me the story about this guy who became the emperor of china and he started off like as a like an orphan like servant and then ended up by the end of his lifetime as the emperor of china i forgot his name but like one of the ancient emperors of china was like started off as an orphan boy with not a dollar to his name and then like rule i mean it sounds like uh genghis khan or something yeah and he was like and like not just like got there like it's not just a hero story like he also like you know like slayed his enemies and like enslaved people or i don't know what he did but like it wasn't all you know just like underdog you know it wasn't just david and goliath and he told me that story and i was like you're a maniac but um you know i actually would love to invest in you because that's the kind of like maniac you want being a founder of these companies like somebody who is wired a little bit differently and uh as i remember hearing that but anyways the phrase you say that's like every great man is also a bad man yeah that's kind of true everybody i like my favorite comedian is louis ck who i believe is currently canceled for you know like doing something gross in front of a bunch of women or whatever you know like and i don't think that's cool but i love louis ck and i still love louis c.k and like i think he's awesome um as a comedian i didn't say he's an awesome character you know that's an awesome human being and i want to be like him no i think he's an amazing comedian and i love his comedy um conor mcgregor you know i had a poster behind me of him you know painting that i had made of him behind me for half these podcasts he's been accused of sexual assault he's been you know he people say he's on drugs and he's kind of a [ __ ] and like other things too he's an amazing fighter and i love his drive of how he went from like a plumber on welfare to the wealthiest fighter of all time and he said the whole time from the very beginning that's what it's going to be he called it and there's videos of him when he's alone in his bedroom not even a professional yet and he says i'm going to be the greatest and here's what i'm going to do i'm going to do xyz and he did it all i admire that but i also think he does a bunch of scumbag [ __ ] and like i'm okay with that trade you know so there's like a bunch of people that are like that i was traveling me and sarah one time were driving by uh chick-fil-a and we were like i want to get that do you want that and she was like yeah i want that so bad and we were and she was like but do we want to support them uh this was right when they like did some stuff uh anti-tank marriage yeah and uh we were like well my taste buds don't really know if you're homophobic so i think we'd be it's okay i think we could like the chicken but also or it was something maybe we were at some place and they had the chicken there and i was like i don't think my taste buds could tell if you're homophobic or not so we could probably eat it um all right let's answer a video question a lot lately i've been thinking about trying to hire my friends as operators of sorts and i'm just worried about like damaging that relationship like i think it's an awesome idea being able to choose who i work with i'm just concerned that all that friendship could uh go away when there's something as important as like business and money involved um i have a pretty strong opinion on that which is no i think you actually shouldn't in most cases don't do it in some cases it makes sense but in most cases i actually think it's a bad idea and i also have myself failed at doing this a little bit but i actually don't think you should be friends with your co-worker or your friends with your employees if you're a manager you shouldn't be friends with your employees if you're a business owner or ceo i actually don't think i think you should be friendly but i think you should be really careful about being friends with your employees um and so my opinion is no i also think that like you probably disagree sean or maybe you do but like even if they're if you're worth your co-workers and anytime in the evening and alcohol shows up i think you should leave i don't even think you should be in the same room um so i'm pretty strict about that although i am friends with a lot of my co-workers so i don't exactly follow all this but i i think that i'll might regret some of that we're opposites on this so uh you know what's funny i always try to be friends with my employees and i feel like they don't want to be friends with me so i'm like yeah i'm like yeah i'm trying to be friends with them and then i'm like oh that's weird you guys all got together that saturday and like oh yeah i was just at home coulda could it come yeah well what's funny is like when you like start a business and you work a lot like you don't really have that many friends like i'm friends with you and jack and ramon and like four i've got like four friends but my co-workers are like i'm like will you guys be my friends i'm with you all the time and i don't get invited to anything either yeah so i i realized pretty quickly uh they don't want me around uh and i was like but it's weird i'm such a good guy and so anyways that part didn't work not because i i didn't intentionally try not to be friends with them they just didn't be friends with me back that's okay the main thing for for me on the hiring side is um i would say hire your competent friends so um my very first business i started i started with two of my best buddies from college and we were just like yeah we're gonna do this ah we you know well there's no ceo there's no hierarchy here we'll all just make decisions together we'll all split the equity perfectly equally we didn't really like put too much thought into it because we were just like 21 year old kids didn't really know much about anything and like fast forward a year later we had to have like a very uncomfortable conversation with one of the guys which was like hey dude like i feel like you're not pulling your weight and he was trying but like we were just like you're kind of just doing this part and like we feel like we're doing these other eight parts and in retrospect i don't even know if that was really true but it definitely was an uncomfortable conversation and i could see the downside of it but what i would say is like the the saving grace for me has always been i only have hired my competent friends and competent friends do two things one is they perform so you don't have this you're not just hiring a buddy because you're your buddy you're hiring this person because they're good but you only know them because they're your buddy the second thing is they are reasonable and they will unders they will understand if you're really clear up front about like look here's the dynamic like we're buddies but sometimes i'm gonna have to tell you if i feel like the job's not getting done and i actually i want you to tell me too if you think that's true like are we okay if it's gonna be kind of uncomfortable like we're not just gonna be able to just shoot the [ __ ] like we gotta also have these two modes that we can operate in and i wanna make sure like you're on board with that so i'm i think with it with a little bit of good communication up front you can get the big benefit which is it's way more fun to do stuff with friends like companies are hard they take a long time it's like a really long road trip and you want to be in the car with people you really like and so whether those were new people who you just happen to enjoy great or they're people you already enjoyed who you invite into the car because they're your buddy and you want to do this company with them i think when it works when you do it with your friends it's the best and uh when it doesn't work it's even worse than if they were they were not your friends so you got to take the good with the bad but um we had a podcast with this guy on this feed called mike brown who you introduced me to him i met him at your office yeah he had a successful business then he brought both of his brothers on board and i was like why did you do that let most people say you know don't do business with family it gets messy he's like these are my brothers i love these guys i want to see them every day i want to hang out with them i want to win together i want us all to win he's like i if he's like i feel blessed that i got to set this up where i get to do business with my best friends and i was like well when you say it like that like what the hell am i thinking about that's obvious said that sounds great and so i think there are downsides but i'm of the mindset of if you pick competent people you won't regret it um all right we'll do a couple more fast questions someone asked who could squat more weight i think i think me sure that's definitely you i have uh i have osgood slaughters in my knees if you if you have it you know if you don't have it you don't know but because of that i don't squat i can't i never squatted my whole life because uh of that issue um okay this is a deep one it's cool we'll answer it what are your biggest insecurities uh both what are the biggest insecurities both of you struggle with uh i'll say i'll go first sometimes i'm i get incredibly insecure that anything i make won't be good enough because i move too fast and i just do surface level [ __ ] and i don't treat it like a crafts like a craftsman enough and i don't like think things through i get pretty self-conscious when i meet really smart people who i meet a ton of them through this job i'm like oh my god this person's iq is just like they're so much smarter than me i just cannot keep up like because uh so i i'm insecure about that i'm insecure um that i um like i didn't go to stanford or like a fancy school and when i meet people in the in crowd like when we meet guys like andrew chen who who who works in andreessen horowitz i'm like dude like i kind of want to be in the in crowd but like i don't want to work that hard to do it and i just don't care that much but i wish i did i feel a little insecure about that um um and i feel uh i get insecure because i'm pretty loud and that sometimes makes people not take me as seriously as i think they should so those are mine those are really good ones and i think very relatable probably for most people um mine i would say i don't even know if there's insecurity as much as like because when people say insecurity it's usually like what's something you worry about but it's not really true but you kind of worry too much about it i think mine like is true it's more like here's your weakness here's your you know your um your weakness or your flaw i would say like and something i i kind of worry about which is i don't really filter myself um and i so i just talk a lot and i don't really think about it before i do it i don't really think i don't even filter myself with actions like like i said with a rolling phone i was like oh that's cool let's do it can we do it today let's do it now i don't want to think things through and so um i would say the fear i have and the insecurity i have is around actually like hurting people's feelings like sometimes i could say stuff that's inconsiderate or um or hurtful in some way or like you know too opinionated and no nobody asks for your [ __ ] opinion type of thing um so i i'm kind of conscious of that like i would say i'm pretty self self-conscious about that that's the word not insecure i'm self-conscious that while i do that and i don't really like that part of me that like i will say things and do things that i don't really think about how that how other how others will feel about it and um and also like when i meet people like our friend ramon who's so considerate i just feel so inconsiderate in comparison and i'm like oh i want to be that way but man i'm like the opposite and like you know i'm like i'm like a knuckle dragger i'm just like yeah a neanderthal so i feel really bad about that and then i would say like the other minor insecurity is like am i just wasting my talents like so when i meet people who are doing really amazing things like scott harrison you know he's been on a 15-year mission to bring clean drinking water to the world i went with him to africa and we went to a town where they had installed one of the water wells and literally the town was like it was like a parade that scott was here they literally thought this guy was jesus and uh he kind of like looked like jesus in the moment i thought he was jesus at the moment and like he's totally humble he hated that they were celebrating him he was there like not for that reason but um that's the reality of the impact of his work is he literally changes like the lives of entire like towns essentially in africa and um and so then when i see that i'm like what am i wasting do i need to do this silly e-commerce thing do i need to do this newsletter who gives a [ __ ] you know and so sometimes i feel really small about the way i decided to use my time and my talents i completely agree with that compared to other people um last question uh when are you guys gonna do since covet is pretty much in the past when is the next meetup going to happen i'm actually doing a meet so i'm driving to st louis to spend a week with my family there and i'm stopping in oklahoma city because that was just like the middle ground and i tweeted out so i've got like 30 or 40 or 50 people i forget how many people rsvp'd for a breakfast in oklahoma city and if you're down sean although you just had a baby so uh imagine we're going to wait a little while i would totally be down of doing like a two-week tour or something where we go from place to place to place i don't know if we could drive i don't know what you'd want to do but i'm totally down like a two-week thing yes totally agree i think like if we just said all right this fall we're gonna go on tour we're gonna go to these seven cities seven cities in seven days or seven cities in ten days or something like that and we just like set up the events i would love to do that uh i think that would be amazing we just hired a community manager her name's april um and she set this event up for me i just said hey i'm going to show up in oklahoma city can you get like can you book me a hotel and uh set up like an eventbrite and i'll tweet it out and um well we can have her do that and help help us you uh do something really great that i think you should tell people which is when you you hosted events but you make the themes great so like you used to do this thing called pizza and 40s um so can you give me i don't even know what other ones you've done but like tell the people of some of the different events you've done because i think it's really smart when you set those events up people want to come and yeah they behave differently because of the theme of how you set up because i've been to a lot of silicon valley networking events are boring as [ __ ] you don't want to go and when people go they're all like surface level level like they you know it's not a fun place to be they don't let their guard down your events are very different so can you what are some of the different themes you've come up with and like do you have a theory on why that works no i don't have a theory i just think it's fun uh i do it for the what i said earlier in the episode i it just because it's cool that's the only reason why so i do the anti-mba that's a book club where we get an expert to come in and discuss the book's topic um i've done this sounds douchey to say but like i don't even drink so that's why it's funny but we have this thing called pizza and 40s so the speaker gets a 40-ounce beer because a 40-ounce beer takes like an hour to drink and as and so we only would have pizza because we were poor and that's all we could afford and we would give the speaker a 40-ounce beer they've got to drink the beer and when the beer's done the talk's done and the answers get a little bit wilder as they get deeper into the beer we did 2x which was focused on women telling their story it stands for 2x chromosomes um we had like did you go to the one that we had in the marina no what's that um we used to do 2x at this thing called palace of fine arts and we had like literally 2 000 women there in san francisco it probably was like the largest contingency of like uh uh tech women probably in the world or in the country it was kind of interesting um so we did that what else do we do hustle con con con uh which is con con is the startup that's the content conference i thought com con was a funny name what else uh anything else have you do i feel like you've done some breakfast thing before have you done a breakfast thing rise and grind yeah we did rise and grind um which was we were talking about different stuff in the morning over and like a grind like coffee like coffee but also like working hard you're good at this you're good at coming up with kind of a catchy name and a catchy theme for people to get behind uh and the vibe is very different so i think that's if somebody's doing it like that doesn't take any extra money it just takes like a little creativity and like you've made your thing better and cooler more fun for you to do more fun for people to come to more fun for speakers to attend because it's different than the average thing so long story short uh maybe late summer if you're down yeah i'm definitely down all right great that's it we'll do it i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what travel never looking back [Music] uh

have you seen what keith reboy is doing as his new startup no so you know who he is yeah so he's the guy who uh uh he was like ex-paypal then he was the ceo of square he's kind of a known investor founder's fund then he started he's a known like people think he's a total on twitter super hilarious to follow because he's a just absolute jerk to people um you know his like number one tweet is just like wrong the period and he won't tell you why he won't argue back he just calls you an idiot and then if you like try to argue he's like this is why i'm i was more successful at the age of 27 than you are at 40. and he just like rips people like that and like who does that that's nobody does that so i think that's just like really crazy and entertaining to me um but anyways he's doing so he did open door and what opendoor is is now is like a publicly listed company because they did us back and opendoes a multi-billion dollar company and basically it was like selling your house is a time-consuming and stressful process what if like the day you want to sell you could just sell your house right away give you a price you say yes or no and that's what opendoor did so they basically would just buy your house and then they had a lot of data to know how much to buy your house for and then they were the brokers they could keep the broker fee for themselves buying and selling and then they would sell it within like 90 days hopefully and they do this in a whole bunch of markets like arizona and stuff like that and so they've done very well you know kind of like on paper and like zillow now like does the same thing to try to compete with them they kind of changed the way that the the business model of these big real estate companies worked where now like the money to be made is in basically like auto buying your bit auto buying your house and then reselling it for you and using a bunch of technology to do that anyways his new company he's starting uh with with jake jack abraham is uh called open store and so we have open door and now you have open store i no they haven't released a bunch of details but i think i know what it is which is it is open door for buying businesses so it's the same idea for buying i think it's going to be specialized in online businesses but maybe not um where basically you just say here's my business and then they say here's your offer we'll buy it off you and um and so i don't know if this is gonna be specialized like e-commerce roll-ups like a thrasio um i don't know if it's gonna be online and offline like um where did you learn about this and what what can i go is there a website yet uh they announced it so i heard about it a few weeks ago like six weeks ago maybe and i was like oh that's super interesting how did you hear about this so somebody told me about it because their friend interviewed at the company and so that's like the only way you could know about it because like when you're interviewed they like kind of tell you the premise of the company and that guy was like oh dude you know keith was doing a new thing it's basically open door for bit buying businesses and i was like oh that's sick that's a great idea because buying but selling your business is also just like is even more than buying a home in terms of time consuming stressful uncertain on what price you're going to get uncertain what price it even should be and um and the marketplace is to do that online like buy biz buy biz sell or whatever that website is like.com they're so like old school you know like on how they do that and so um so i think there's like room for improvement there so i found that to be really interesting let me bring this up real quick which is it's so crazy how often internet marketers who often are accused of being sleazy and many of them are i mean they're accused of being that because they are but they're often ahead of the game so for example email marketing email newsletters are all the rage right now uh scammy guys like i don't think this guy's actually scamming me but david d'angelo he used to sell dating books in the 1990s by having these long emails i just stole and copied from him um the other thing is paid memberships paid memberships have been a thing for decades now guys like greg your friend our friend greg is doing a paid community thing and greg's like a cool guy um and so it's like it's like cool to do it um and there's so many more and this is another one buying and selling businesses online has been a thing that internet marketers so for example flippa where you could buy affiliate websites that's been a thing for years empire flippers is another one empire builders and if you go as empire flippers or empire builders i think those are actually two things but they but if you go to those websites you're gonna a lot of people are gonna be immediately turned off you're gonna think what the is this and startup guys like us we just come in i guess that's what we are we just come in and we take this stuff that these guys have been doing for years and we just say put some lipstick on it yeah one 2.0 make it a flat beautiful color uh it's so funny because like cool this sounds neat but this isn't unique right uh yeah i think you know there's no unique ideas really there's you know remixes of ideas there's old ideas that you make new there's new platforms but but i think it's cool and i think it could be big uh it's one i'm going to keep my eye on then i saw another business like this so i started to put together a little bit of a pattern here and i said oh what is open door for x so what other parts of life and uh in the world could use instant liquidity because that's what this is it's basically taking something that was kind of illiquid like your house and it takes a lot of time to get liquid where you actually sell the thing and takes a lot of you know you got to like you got to move out you got to stage it you got to repaint it you got to get a broker you got to list it you got to do tours no instant liquidity we buy your house today don't do any of that um same thing with your buying your business what else needs that and then i saw another one and this business is called um i grabbed the name but it's basically doing this for used electronics it's called backflip just got funded and backflip is basically saying we'll instantly buy any of your used electronics and uh because that's not a new thing either and and i think it's awesome and so it's not that it's new it's basically that there is a big swing being taken by people who are going to try to do this at scale using like the modern kind of internet marketing and models to do it and so like you know like we buy gold or whatever what else does billboards cards you know like gift cards yeah exactly like um and there's like a gift card there's actually a gift card startup that's crushes uh that that basically took the old bottle and just doesn't know what's it called raise i think raised yeah i'm i'm on their website right now i'm looking at raise.com holy i can look at the traffic and just tell you these guys are printing money yeah raise is gonna be like a billion dollar plus win uh and nobody even like hears about this company nobody talks about this company but you know super simple business of like you know gift cards the gift card business resale of gift cards essentially and so uh so anyways i'm interested in this open door for x which is basically instant liquidity for things that were pretty much interesting all right let's play off that so houses okay there's equity zen which i think is badass uh so equities then equity's in kind of looks more like flippa than it does like open door meaning like it's kind of hard to get in it's kind of obtuse you got to like sign up to see not everything is there it's like a 10-step process to do an investment it's like equity zen is not like it's not robin hood on my phone where i can just like do my thing and so like secondary shares yeah it's like a shitty name like i don't know like it's just bad all around and forge global was the other one it's like also bad i don't know i feel like somebody should do this better carter is trying to carter x is trying to do this better um right now which is like secondary shares of private companies yeah i'm not a fan of carta but um i could see them doing well but i'm not i'm not a fan of carter so i don't know if i want them to be the best at this um angelus is also trying to do it there's a bunch of people trying to do this second trying to do open door trying to do what they're trying to do is a little bit different they're just still trying to do the marketplace what opendoor did was different it wasn't like open door wasn't just another housing marketplace it was i will buy the thing off you right now because i know what i can sell it for um and i'll i'll i'm comfortable with this five percent spread that i will i will keep so you give up five percent of your upside but you get the certainty of it being done now and um and i'm comfortable in that five percent spread so somebody would need to do this for secondary shares would they just go you want to sell your your company stock done and then i will figure out how to re-flip this thing on the other side with my own spread so there's a few people that have done this with furniture and furniture's really hard because furniture doesn't ship well yeah um but there is if you i don't know if you know i mean i buy i like buying used furniture because you can get like 10 dollar couches for like three grand um and what's oftentimes they're really nice used furniture is not really a thing on the internet uh or at least it's not hugely popular but you could i think there is still an interesting way you can do this with used furniture right um so i think training cards is one so i know a lot of people that have sports cards they collect it as a kid it's in their attic somewhere it's in a box they kind of heard of cards are worth something but they don't like they don't know what they have they don't know what it's worth they don't have them graded they didn't send them into psa and pay the money to get them graded so i think if somebody basically did the shoebox model where you basically say put it all in a shoebox and mail it to us and we will pay you for it uh we'll do all the work of figuring out what it's worth and then we'll pay you you know 70 cents on the dollar for for what it's worth and like today you're getting nothing for it and like that that's the and if if you don't like our offer we'll send it back and i think that somebody did that they could just hoover up all the long tail of like trading cards that are out there um that people are not doing anything with that they want to monetize that's interesting okay so uh we've we've furniture is not that good trading cards are pretty interesting because it's a lot easier cars everyone a lot of people do cars carvana does cars and i think that that is so sick they're a multi-billion dollar is that the same model they use where they'll just instantly buy your car off you yeah like they'll buy it in a matter of minutes which if you told me this like years ago i'd be like no way that can't be done but they made uh 5.6 billion dollars last year in sales so it worked okay so it's working open door for cars working yeah yeah it totally works um what else is interesting what's a huge thing like what's what are some of the bigger assets that you possibly have in your life that you want to wow carvana's market cap is 45 billion dollars holy yeah it's working um what else is there i don't know there's gonna be some obscure like oh like life insurance policy payouts or something or like you know like something like that that i'm like i don't even know that space but that makes sense it takes you know it's something that you get or like social security like i know like my parents are getting to the age where they can collect social security like would they take a lump sum of all their social security now and you know at 70 cents or 72 cents on the dollar and then you know this company just collects the payments over time like probably i don't know like there's a lot of people who would make that trade dude did you know this so there's this uh a company i have to go and look at what it is but you guys could probably google it actually but i think some banks do it like goldman will do it but if you have a winning lottery ticket they'll buy it off you right and they'll give you the money up front and it's structured in such a way where they're they're still able to make their profit but they'll buy lottery tickets from you like we're talking like 10 million lottery tickets or seven figures uh i uh it's kind of interesting people buy winning lottery tickets off of people that's actually kind of an interesting one i would actually need to do some research how many people do how much money do you think is one in the lottery per year oh dude i have no idea i mean i feel like the weekly lottery the powerball every week is like you know between 50 and like 200 million dollars it's like it's like that's that's like on a weekly basis that it now it doesn't get one every week that's how it accrues and that's how it gets bigger but like you know i don't know you have the number in front of you i feel like it's i don't know no i uh no i i can't find it there there's 1600 lotteries created each year so there's at least 1600 unique winners um no i don't i don't have the numbers but lottery tickets might actually be kind of interesting because you said the life insurance i'm like what do you wait to get paid for that you would take a discounted upfront payment lotteries is kind of is actually kind of interesting um and i do know that some banks actually do that right you know who else does that is whitey bulger you remember whitey bulger i've never even heard that those words in my life do you do you know the movie the departed yes you know jack nicholas's character okay yes it's modeled after whitey bulger he was a gangster in uh boston he was an italian or an irish mafia guy he uh or a mobster guy he ended up going to jail recently they found him and they um um he got beat to death in jail so it was like a crazy ending to the story of him he was america's most wanted man for like 20 years and um anyway he as part of his story he won the lottery three times and the way that he did it is people who had won the lottery that in the neighborhood they would have to go to him and he would buy it from you and he would go and cash the ticket and uh so this is like a fame like the numbers game they call it that's like a famous mafia thing i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back

okay so a couple other things i wanted to bring up one is a pain point or kind of a business opportunity maybe this exists if it exists tell me because i want to use this service so in e-commerce most e-commerce brands are just local in their own geography so most are let's say most u.s ecommerce brands basically just sell in the us and then it takes time and then you start selling in canada and then you start selling in europe and then you know but it takes a long time and the reason it takes a long time is because of the like international logistics so for example you want to ship something to canada they have to pay like pretty heavy duty like a import duty on the product so you sell like a 50 product they're gonna have to pay like 20 of import taxes in addition to the shipping so it just becomes like irresponsible to buy and still some customers do because they can only get the product from the us-based company but it really sucks and then the company has to like fill out this form that says these goods are worth 14 and then you submit that at the thing and then it's just annoying right and so i think there should be a company so there's these brands trying to do these e-commerce roll-ups i think you should do it differently i think some enterprising entrepreneur can basically say look i will boot up your canadian operation today i'll boot up your uk operation your france operation yeah i'll do europe i'll do uk i'll do um australia whatever right so basically say i'll import your brand today you do no work so all you have to do is you need to ship me this product to this warehouse so here's the address ship me your products uh i need like you know whatever your normal inventory is ship 10 to me and let's see how i do and basically you get one giant warehouse where you're warehousing for all the brands that you're going to work with and you just say look uh in exchange for doing this you pay me no money i will start generating sales for you but i want a royalty i want a royalty of 10 cents or 15 cents for every dollar but what's your point what like how's this how is this interesting or new uh because i don't know of a brand that that does this that exists so you know my wife has an e-commerce brand we sell in the u.s i would love to be making more money by selling in europe but the time the operational overhead to go to europe right now is just crazy so why aren't there more people that are reaching out to e-commerce store owners and basically saying i will run your international operation and make it a low-risk no risk proposition for them in order to do so and i think there's a lot of money to be made given the number of e-commerce brands in the us and how you could if you're in brazil or you're in australia or you're in canada or wherever i think you could become the leading trusted like kind of like we're we are your canada go to canada go to market plan for canada and we just do all the work for you this is actually quite common in media so there's business insider india there's business insider australia there's business insider germany i believe um and then uh um i think i believe the wall street journal does the same thing for those same countries but it's uh there is buzzfeed france uh huffpo france huffa australia it's actually pretty common in media um so so is it run out of the us or they hire a team there or it's a local team there that just licenses the brand basically when they report the revenue it's under licensing and so i don't exactly know what that means though because i was trying i was thinking about us and i was like man we have a lot of people who are uh english as a second language folks uh in germany so like uh i guess germany i guess is one of the most populous i don't know i don't know numbers i guess it's one of the most populous places in europe it's uh very business focused so you know the germans liked us um same with australia australians loved us and i was like yeah let's go do it but what the [ __ ] do i do do i just fly over there and just start recruiting like it's it's crazy i would love to partner with them and then another thing is in particular china and japan and there's actually a whole word for this there's a word i can't remember what the word is but there's a word that describes why it's difficult to break into japan um and the reason is is that once it's hard to break into an island in particular japan and i would love to have paid someone to be like hey can you be my japanese uh consecuti like my my capo on the ground those are all mob terms because i'm into the mafia now uh can you be my my guy on the street of japan and let me know is this good am i getting the right people i think that's incredibly interesting yeah exactly so i'm i'm not saying that this doesn't exist i'm saying there's still a lot of room there because i know a lot of people i have a lot of friends who are doing ecommerce right we host club ltv there's you know 75 to 100 e-commerce brands each doing over a million dollars a year in there and every single one of them i think has the same problem which is that we're all u.s focused and why are we us focused because it would be too much of a lift too much of a lift to go figure out how to do australia it's too small of a pie to like do manpower on or spend brain power on but if somebody in australia was like hey look this is what we do this is our business model we help you get sales here and we just take our cut and uh and so i just think that like there needs there's more opportunity for this and that's cool that media it sounds like there's also an opportunity to do it in media too or being done in some way by the big players it's being done in some way but like i remember when buzzfeed uh like were going through some troubles they had a layoff like their whole french office and i was like buzzfeed has a french office what the [ __ ] that's the opposite right that's we have a french office and then you have to do things like that when it's like not working out i'm saying no investment no consulting fees you just take a royalty on sales and these are all incremental sales that i wasn't getting otherwise and you take care of the whole operational headache in this case for ecommerce about like i just ship your goods to your warehouse you ship it to local customers customers don't have to overpay customers don't have to do import duties uh for every order they make and so i just think that there's a opportunity in e-commerce to like be the the go-to brand for every d2c brand to partner with in each of these locales what country would you go to next um i think europe is probably the best because you want um what the you know the next wealthiest high populous place um but really it could work anywhere it's just like the biggest market is doing it you know throughout europe now europe is made up of so many countries maybe that's a pain in the ass if not like canada's the no-brainer australia next japan is a good one um those would be the ones india maybe like for example i know a bunch of people in india who did this so uh my dad introduced me to these guys and i was like oh wow why is these guys their house is humongous how you know what do they do it's like oh yeah they um they partnered with jockey underwear and they just became the jockey like seller here they have exclusive rights to sell jockey in india next guy at the dinner table what do you do oh we're the domino's guys in india what yeah we're the exclusive franchisee of dominoes for india um okay what does that mean well we have like indians didn't really eat pizza before this so we're like teaching people to eat pizza they [ __ ] love it turns out and so we have like you know 9 000 dominoes throughout india now like oh my god what is going on here it's like you know local franchisee but for what's this called what's the terminal what's the term for this i don't know you know maybe i should have gone to business school i think it's probably just like in brick and mortar i think it's just called franchising um franchising was the way to sp spread geographically you know when your brick and mortar can only scale so fast uh that's how you would do it you would franchise out and then the franchise would pay a royalty back to it back to the master franchise of the brand of their sales and they're they're the local operator but with e-commerce or with digital media it's a little bit different but it kind of has the same problem so i don't know if there's a new word for it man i think this is wildly fascinating this is a i didn't think it was that interesting at first but now i know what you're talking about where uh i've heard so many stories of the same thing but not maybe not of india but i am the official uh importer of x y and z yeah we're the distributor of x or like for you just think about for your business right like would could you have sold for more if you had like 250 000 you know or like 500 000 subscribers in japan and like dude i think there's a world where i would have been where i could have made more money in those markets than i did in america because even though america has more people um i don't think the french or i don't think that the germans um i don't think facebook kicks as much ass over there as it does here with instagram and everything and so i think the ad markets because i i do think that europe sorry europeans if you're listening i do think that you guys are five or ten years behind when it comes to some technology stuff um and the ad markets suck because of facebook and google so like if you could still capture a little bit of that revenue i think you could well i don't know if any of that's true but what i do know is that it's true trust me as you're building well i think like everybody uses facebook everywhere so that's the part i'm saying i don't know um well sorry but what i mean is like old media still does quite well abroad okay that's fair that's fair uh the thing i'm just saying is like if while you were building your u.s business and all your employees are focused on your us business if somebody said i love your product i'd love to license the brand from you or or i'd love to be your partner in in the uk or in japan or in australia and i will build i will use the same playbook it'll be under your company i just want my cut for building this for you because i'm going to private you would have done it means there was an opportunity for some entrepreneur that should have been reaching out to you saying this is a no-lose proposition you still own it you still make money off of it it's still your name brand i just get to go i get to basically take your brand take your head take your product and localize it or distribute it here where i'm from and i know the market yeah and my product's way easier than yours it was because it's pixels it's not anything real and i would have loved to have done that and i used to have people emailing me all the time and then we had a bunch of people in russia some people in mexico who would just verbatim copy our [ __ ] and i would say i would have to i'd find it and i'd be like you guys stop this dude you're not allowed to do this and then i'd have other people who would email me like hey can i try did you stop anyone from doing that i feel like you can't do [ __ ] if somebody takes your newsletter and they just word for word transcribe it in russia and they're like we're called whatever how hustle are you no there's nothing you could do the only thing that i was able to do the only thing i was able to do we had someone do this an italian we had someone do it in russian and we had someone do it in mexico uh yeah mexico and i basically shamed them i said like i'm just gonna i'm just gonna call you out and so i would tweet at them or i would email them uh i i would just would make it well known and my network was large enough that someone of someone knew them and they were embarrassed and they yeah and they stopped doing it but no i didn't do [ __ ] yeah and i had people email me all the time saying hey can i do this for uh spain and i would say yeah but i don't really know anything about you i don't know if you've got good taste i don't like i don't i know nothing about you and i would just throw it off to the side and just kind of forget about it feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like my days off on a road less travel never looking back

we talked about the background is we talked about chess.com last episode i tweeted about it because i was even more people loved that tweet dude that tweet had tons of engagement um it was good and the the summary of this is that i actually we underestimated it so chess.com gets around 200 million monthly uniques they have 60 million registered users they uh traffic has grown significantly if i had a guest they do at least 100 million in recurring revenue subscription revenue uh potentially is worth a billion dollars super fascinating company um go ahead what were you gonna say we were trying to hype it and we actually were under hyping even even though we were trying to hype it um and by the way the guy who started he's like a ex stanford guy or the guy who owns it uh you know it's two i think stanford guys uh which is cool like you know they didn't go the same track probably as 95 of their classmates and they're going to outperform 99 of them just by by doing something really simple that the world wanted so i started thinking about this because we talked about it you brought it up cool topic cool bit really cool business it really fits the what we call the new zealand type of business that andrew wilkinson kind of coined that that phrase which is it's this independent thing it has like a cult following it's profitable it's simple it's not nobody competes with it it's like new zealand nobody's going to war with with chess.com uh you know the biggest competitor i think it's called lie chess or something like that it's basically like an open source free you know like kind of like alternative and it's also doing extremely well and those are like the two uh but it seems like people kind of prefer chess.com so i started thinking okay what's the nextchest.com what are the others is there a whole slew of these guys because i think that's where we didn't talk about last time that we should have and so i wanted to double click in a little bit so i started and that was that's a really really hard question i've been thinking about it too i only came up with like dominoes i looked into solitaire websites they a lot of them crush uh but yeah that's a hard question to ask so i spent 10 15 minutes on it but that was enough to tell me something very interesting so the first one that came to mind was because here's the characteristics that you need you need a game played by tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of people that is not owned by a brand chess forks checkers also works but the problem with checkers is it's so simple that it's not as like uh there's not as much depth to it therefore not as much of a like kind of like uh money made and passion around the sport uh sudoku was the second one that came to mind so i went to sudoku.com and sudoku.com it's just like chess.com it's like you you go to snoke.com and there's already a sudoku board waiting for you with clock going and it's like oh play here it is you don't need to download you don't need to sign up you don't need to do anything just play sudoku i love that then they you scroll down a little bit and you see like this advertisement for like a mobile app a mobile soku app so i click that i'm like i bet this app i bet this is an amazing distribution for this app app crushes so this company called easy brand behind it so the sudoku app that they have has 50 million downloads the uh on just google play forget about iphone that's just google that's just android um probably 100 million total lifetime downloads the website itself gets you know 10 to 20 million visitors a month uh so they're getting free tr like basically free traffic to their mobile apps where they're able to monetize and easy brain basically makes they're like a mobile app developer that makes these apps they've had over 750 million downloads lifetime of these little simple number game apps starting with sudoku then like a remix of sudoku then like another number game if you like that one and they just cross promote them within each other i bet this company is crushing it they're based in europe and that's like i have information on on them i just found some interesting stuff when i googled them and went to the website there was something amazing about them that immediately stuck out and and just this quick google it i'm wrong but it is based in cyprus any time a company is based in cyprus it it's like it's turns out these guys actually are uh from like the belarus they're actually from this area but they're based in cyprus so i just googled it real quick so uh did you know that it was they were acquired um three months ago no i did not know this so that's okay that's not the piece i have their revenues i have their profit and i have the uh all their user numbers and i have can i guess i'm going to be totally wrong but i i like to guess by the way a little tip always guess before you hear any number that's how you get good at knowing numbers because you guess and then when you're wrong your brain remembers that and you you start to hone that gut instinct okay so here's here's my guess okay well uh how much were they what what's their revenue i'm gonna guess that their revenue was 400 million dollars a year okay what's their um profit 90 million dollars a year pretty good um all right how much were they required for i'm gonna guess that they're required for 852 million dollars okay and how many um how many daily active users do they have across their 15 games i'm gonna say they have 25 million dau okay so i didn't do you didn't do horrible okay so easy brain was acquired uh last this most recent february uh they were uh acquired for 640 million dollars in stock and up to 120 million dollars of additional consideration if they hit it so 640 yeah what is that that isn't that exactly 850 no what's six uh what 640 plus 100 is 740 plus 25 is five seven eight so great job you guessed 8.50 great job you're almost there um they their revenue is uh in 2020 revenues were 210 million dollars okay so you were off there by half you guessed 400 million but their profit was 70 million you guessed 90. right pretty good um they've had 750 installs over the course of their the lifetime of all their other things all their games they have uh 15 live games with 12 million daily active users you guessed 25 million okay not bad not bad um what a company so okay so that was the first one i thought of and by the way i think that there's other versions of that like you know i don't know go look at like you know sudokuonline.com i don't know what's that like you know all the things people are going to google search if you can get the top level domain for those that's really interesting um so then i started looking at some others poker.com so i went to poker.com and poker.com is like kind of like this crappy like just describe what you're looking at when you go to it let me look at this but you can't this is an actual poker right you're not betting it's not even a as you can't play there it's just like reviews here's it's like an affiliate site so it's like oh here's a place to play poker here's where you can go because they get big kickbacks for basically sending a player to pokerstars or wherever if they deposit and so this is horrible website um crappy kind of like affiliate and reviews site dude you could do so much more with this website like if somebody was like dude i'm gonna i have a if you have a mobile poker app that's like good i would pay like ungodly amounts of money for poker.com i think that that's a and they also if you like do their traffic search see what they get it's nothing so they should be getting a lot more traffic having poker.com um okay so then there's some other ones crossword puzzle.com crossword.com the go to this like they don't even like crossroads.com or something it doesn't even like render it's like a there's like fun asterisks on the screen yeah like what's going on here because crossword is the other game that's like sudoku it's like chess that people played religiously and they love we talked about how how much the new york times makes off their mini crossword game the number was uh 90 million dollars in subscription revenue from crossword puzzles for the new york times so so i am surprised that crossword puzzle across the puzzles.com crossword.com i can't believe that these sites are not being like leveraged so i was very surprised to see this and follow-up uh yeah so you go to crosswoodpuzzle.com it says please email suggestions to dkw99999 yahoo.com right so i emailed the guy so so so you see this the website is basically like a white page with a bunch of text and it's basically just the very bottom things the very bottom it says this dome no this domain is not for sale please do not inquire about purchasing it all emails from anonymous are unknown companies asking me a price will be ignored sorry last updated july 2007 right so i emailed this guy i was like hey uh saw your website um like i think it's awesome that you're not trying to sell this but i'm curious like why aren't you trying to sell this and uh what's your you know what do you want this to be why do you believe like why do you believe that it should be done this way i you know i'm just super curious like what's your thought process so we'll see if he replies i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back

the very bottom it says this dome no this domain is not for sale please do not inquire about purchasing it all emails from anonymous are unknown companies asking me a price will be ignored sorry last updated july 2007 right so i emailed this guy i was like hey uh saw your website um like i think it's awesome that you're not trying to sell this but i'm curious like why aren't you trying to sell this and he's like refuses to monetize it refuses to sell it i think it's hilarious what what is this i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking better let's talk about business ideas um first of all let me give you an update did you see someone in the facebook group um launched a pickleball newsletter because we told them to uh a few months ago because we told you and it's now it's now their full-time job and they traveled the country uh getting their products into stores and things like that so it started as a pickleball newsletter right and then they partnered with the pro tour of pickleball which i don't know it was a thing and then they started selling their own stuff out of a van their own pickleball equipment and now they're in retail stores what's your name give a shout out thomas shields good job thomas thomas um looks like a young kid he looks like uh a younger better looking version of me uh let's see what i can't uh yeah he looks young he looks real young so congratulations thomas shield that's great i think the ceo or the founder of pickleball either listens to the pod or he messaged once being like yeah i'm down to come on so we we can have them on if you ever want to we could do an episode about how like alternative sports basically and do some research and have them on as well great and speaking of alternative sports you want to talk about chess yeah so i have a follow-up there i don't know if you have one or or just what i put there um go ahead what were you gonna say so we talked about the background is we talked about chess.com last episode i tweeted about it because i was even more people loved that tweet dude that tweet had tons of engagement um it was good and the the summary of this is that i actually we underestimated it so chess.com gets around 200 million monthly uniques they have 60 million registered users they uh traffic has grown significantly if i had a guest they do at least 100 million in recurring revenue subscription revenue uh potentially is worth a billion dollars super fascinating company um go ahead what were you gonna say we were trying to hype it and we actually were under hyping even even though we were trying to hype it um and by the way the guy who started he's like a ex stanford guy or the guy who owns it has two i think stanford guys uh which is cool like you know they didn't go the same track probably as 95 percent of their classmates and they're going to outperform 99 of them just by by doing something really simple that the world wanted so i started thinking about this because we talked about it you brought it up cool topic cool bit really cool business it really fits the what we call the new zealand type of business that andrew wilkinson kind of coined that that phrase which is it's this independent thing it has like a cult following it's profitable it's simple it's nobody competes with it it's like new zealand nobody's going to war with with chess.com uh you know the biggest competitor i think it's called lie chess or something like that it's basically like an open source free you know like kind of like alternative and it's also doing extremely well and those are like the two uh but it seems like people kind of prefer chess.com so i started thinking okay what's the nextchest.com what are the others is there a whole slew of these guys because i think that's where we didn't talk about last time that we should have and so i wanted to double click in a little bit so i started and that was that's a really really hard question i've been thinking about it too i only came up with like dominoes i looked into solitaire websites they a lot of them crush but yeah that's a hard question to ask so i i spent 10-15 minutes on it but that was enough to tell me something very interesting so the first one that came to mind was because here's the characteristics that you need you need a game played by tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of people that is not owned by a brand chess works checkers also works but the problem with checkers is it's so simple that it's not as like uh there's not as much depth to it therefore not as much of a like kind of like uh money made and passion around the sport uh sudoku was the second one that came to mind so i went to sudoku.com and sudoku.com it's just like chess.com it's like you you go to snoke.com and there's already a sudoku board waiting for you with clock going and it's like oh play here it is you don't need to download you don't need to sign up you don't need to do anything just play sudoku i love that then they you scroll down a little bit and you see like this advertisement for like a mobile app a mobile sudoku app so i click that i'm like i bet this app i bet this is an amazing distribution for this app app crushes so this company called easybrain behind it so the sudoku app that they have has 50 million downloads the uh on just google play forget about iphone that's just google that's just android um probably 100 million total lifetime downloads the website itself gets you know 10 to 20 million visitors a month uh so they're getting free basically free traffic to their mobile apps where they're able to monetize and easy brain basically makes they're like a mobile app developer that makes these apps they've had over 750 million downloads lifetime of these little simple number game apps starting with sudoku then like a remix of sudoku then like another number game if you like that one and they just cross promote them within each other i bet this company is crushing it they're based in europe and that's like i have information on on them i just found some interesting stuff when i googled them and went to the website there was something amazing about them that immediately stuck out and and just this quick google it i'm wrong but it is based in cyprus any time a company is based in cyprus it's like it's turns out these guys actually are uh from like the belarus they're actually from this area but they're based in cyprus so i just googled it real quick so uh did you know that it was they were acquired um three months ago no i did not know this so that's okay that's the other piece i have their revenues i have their profit and i have the uh all their user numbers and i have can i guess i'm gonna be totally wrong but i i like to guess by the way little tip always guess before you hear any number that's how you get good at knowing numbers because you guess and then when you're wrong your brain remembers that [ __ ] and you start to hone that kind of instinct okay so here's here's my guess okay well uh how much were they what what's their revenue i'm gonna guess that their revenue was 400 million dollars a year okay what's their um profit 90 million dollars a year pretty good um all right how much were they required for i'm gonna guess that they're required for 852 million dollars okay and how many um how many daily active users do they have across their 15 games i'm gonna say they have 25 million dau okay so i didn't do you didn't do horrible okay so easy brain was acquired uh last this most recent february uh they were uh acquired for 640 million dollars in stock and up to 125 million dollars of additional consideration if they hit it so 640 yeah what is that that isn't that exactly 8.50 no what six uh what 640 plus 100 is 740 plus 25 is 765. so great job you guessed 850. great job you're almost there um they their revenue is uh in 2020 revenues were 210 million dollars okay so you were off there by half you guessed 400 million but their profit was 70 million you guessed 90. right pretty good um they've had 750 installs over the course of their the lifetime of all their other things all their games they have uh 15 live games with 12 million daily active users you guessed 25 million okay not bad not bad um what a company so okay so that was the first one i thought of and by the way i think that there's other versions of that like you know i don't know go look at like you know sudokuonline.com i don't know what's that like you know all the things people are going to google search if you can get the top level domain for those that's really interesting um so then i started looking at some others poker.com so i went to poker.com and poker.com is like kind of like this crappy like just describe what you're looking at when you go to it let me look at this but you can't this is an actual poker right you're not betting it's not even a as you can't play there it's just like reviews here's it it's like an affiliate site so it's like oh here's a place to play poker here's where you can go because they get big kickbacks for basically sending a player to pokerstars or wherever if they deposit and so this is horrible website um crappy kind of like affiliate reviews site dude you could do so much more with this website like if somebody was like dude i'm gonna i have a if you have a mobile poker app that's like good i would pay like ungodly amounts of money for poker.com i think that that's a and they also if you like do their traffic search see what they get it's nothing so they should be getting a lot more traffic having poker.com um okay so then there's some other ones crosswordpuzzle.com crossword.com the go to those like they don't even like crossroads.com or something it doesn't even like render it's like a it's like fun astrix on the screen yeah like what's going on here because crossword is the other game that's like sudoku it's like chess that people played religiously and they love we talked about how how much the new york times makes off their mini crossword game the number was uh 90 million dollars in subscription revenue from crossword puzzles for the new york times so so i'm surprised that crossword puzzle across the puzzles.com crossword.com i can't believe that these sites are not being like leveraged so i was very surprised to see this and uh yeah look at this follow up from this so you go to crosswoodpuzzle.com it says please email suggestions to dkw 999 at yahoo.com right so i emailed the guy so so so you see this the website is basically like a white page with a bunch of text and it's basically just the very bottom things the very bottom it says this dome no this domain is not for sale please do not inquire about purchasing it all emails from anonymous are unknown companies asking me a price will be ignored sorry last updated july 2007 right so i emailed this guy and i was like hey uh saw your website um like i think it's awesome that you're not trying to sell this but i'm curious like why aren't you trying to solve this and uh what's your you know what do you want this to be why do you believe like why do you believe that it should be done this way i you know i'm just super curious like what's your thought process so we'll see if he replies there's another website that's like this so bray you see if you could find the name of this i don't remember called thumb head but sam you might know this there is a website that's like it's like a misspelling of google.com or gmail.com i think it might be gmail.com or something like that and it's the same thing it's an all-white webpage that's like yeah frank and susan you know we were married in 1977 and like blah blah no if we are not going to put ads on the site no we did not we owned this before gmail came out it's like they basically just have this web page that gets like and they have a counter of how much traffic they get uh and they just show that they're getting like hundreds of thousands of hits a day and like he's like refuses to monetize it refuses to sell it i think it's hilarious what what is this what uh brady did you find it try to find it i'll find it after the pod otherwise i i have this in my like things to tweet about uh you know full that's actually such a funny idea oh so like if if we just looked at the most visited website and find out what the typos are for each one and go and look at what those are so like right if you go to goggle.com so g-o-g-l-e google owns it so it redirects you most of the time the company owns like their plurals and their misspells but sometimes they don't and then those are hilarious oh my gosh i just uh i was looking at bing i change it to bang don't go there found something else yeah don't go there um what else is there that's like a what what's a like a like a youtube spelled wrong like you can do like facebook uh but you could do like i don't know like you you lose the a or something like that i don't know see what that is god that's so interesting um that that's actually an interesting thing facebook owns facebook with 100. pretty interesting that's actually an interesting thing i'm going to research that after this i don't know if you know the guy who owns bitcoin.com so this guy roger van der whatever i don't know his name is but he's like kind of hated in the bitcoin community by like 80 of the people because he tried to create his own fork of bitcoin so they forked bitcoin i think it's bitcoin cash or bitcoin satoshi's vision bsv i forgot which one he's associated with i think his bitcoin cash but basically he created you know they forked bitcoin and have their own but this guy owns bitcoin.com and uh and so he's like a billionaire guy from bitcoin and like he refuses to give up bitcoin.com but it's like it's like points to the other version of the not popular version of bitcoin you know it's like the this the fifth of jonah's brother who's not in the band or whatever you know it's like it's basically like oh this is kind of a waste and nobody can sue them because it's there's no company behind bitcoin and nobody owns the trademark uh that's a pain in the ass i hate that yeah i'm looking at it now um let's talk about um which one you want to go through we have a bunch on the agenda here um okay does this interest you well first of all i want to tell you about a company i just invested in um and i want you to criticize it or tell me if it's awesome okay oh you actually read it okay so i'm doing we just did a podcast a second ago and sean talked about angel investing i've been doing a little bit of angel investing now and my whole thing is i'm doing this thing called a syndicate i almost did a rolling fund like you but i didn't really want like a full-time job so i was like i'll just do this so it's deal by deal or not a full-time job but whatever it is for you right um and my premise is this and you confirmed it a little bit by your reaction what i'm trying to do is find interesting deals that other angel investors who i think are smarter than me or other like firms who are smarter than me are also investing in but i try to find them where they're explaining the company really poorly and i'm spending time with the founder listening to them and then i'm rewriting a memo about the company and i'm sending it to people to invest in and it's kind of working so i sent you one deck and it was really bad it was confusing um and then i just rewrote it and you're like oh i want to invest in this company maybe yeah and it worked i was kind of gushing i was like dude did they write this memo like who wrote this memo i was like this is the best investment memo i've ever read you were like dude shut up i just wrote some 20 minutes i was like no no trust me i read a lot of these things and i was like it's all the memo was so good that i had to separate the writing which was really entertaining and persuasive and likable from the business because i was like dude i don't want to just like convince myself this is a good business i wanted to be a good business i you know like i love pitches where the founder can just barely explain what the hell they're doing but then i'm like oh that makes total sense and i'm like yes that's like you you get it you're not like a salesman so i'm not like gonna invest in this like hand-wavy [ __ ] it's like no it's real and it's working and you're explaining it in kind of this nonchalant way but it's actually super legit you just don't like get really excited and animated and you don't have great words to describe it yet uh and actually i can help you with that it sounds like you're thinking about the same thing um i'm actually thinking i'm going to simplify my thing which is like just helping them with their landing page and their communication because almost every company invest in their landing page kind of sucks and landing pages are really hard to make good but um they need a lot of help and it's like something that not every other investor is offering to do for them and they actually are not that good at doing it and so uh anyways as i got off topic but your memo was really great i actually want to like publish it in some way without like i don't know what you can do but like i feel like that should be public uh i wanna point to that be like this is great writing here's why you can go to uh you could if you like go to angellisthamptonvc and you can invest if you wanted to or you could even just say you're gonna invest and then like look at it um and then once it's done i'll probably you can publish it or i'll publish it but they uh this company it's lobby.com l-o-b-b-i-e dot com uh it's so funny because he actually did something really good basically and this kind of sounds like simple and negative but it's it's it's a cool company i've invested in it it's basically software that helps doctors uh schedule appointments or patients of schedule appointments with doctors in a in just a good way and it's kind of like an archaic space but he was like we're making the lobby digital and like and i that's so much better than creating than saying we are creating software that's just a crm for the doctor's office and i'm like they're like no we're making the lobby room the lobby digital we're going to save people so much time and so basically the software what it does is it you can you can schedule an appointment online and they'll alert you if the doctor's running late and when you get in the parking lot you can tell them so you just wait your car and they'll tell you when to come in yada yada um i mean it's like the interesting thing about it is the guy has already started and sold the company in the space and uh it's at worst gonna be okay at best might be big um anyway i just thought it was so interesting how it was digitizing the lobby or the waiting room of healthcare and i just wanted to bring that up because i think it's so cool how they repositioned that to make something that isn't that cool sounds kind of neat right yeah you know that that's that's a skill that's like a superpower in and of itself uh i don't have a ton of thoughts on the business itself so i don't have too much to add there but i agree with you basically the most interesting part of talking about lobby was your memo is so damn good and i think we should uh show it to people so that they can see how do you explain how do you make a business seem really juicy to be a part of uh to invest in because i think you did a good job of that well that's what and that's what we're gonna do so i'm doing it with joe and i'll you and i will probably do a bunch together i hope where i'll invest in yours and you mine and the whole thing is i'm not trying to sell people i'm not trying to convince people to do it um you either want to do it or you don't like i'm not going to try and convince you to do it because that's that's kind of unethical but i just want to paint the business in the most positive light or at least what i believe it to be accurate like an accurate it is cool and i want to make sure you know it's cool and i think that this whole copywriting thing for angel investing might end up being a a hit yeah i think it'll be it'll be easy for you to get people into your round because people like you and the memos are good so i think i think those will be those will be good i have a company i wanted to tell you about that's a cool company um that i think you're going to have a good opinion on so uh have you seen what keith reboy is doing as his new startup no so you know who he is yeah so he's the guy who uh uh he was like ex paypal then he was the ceo of square he's kind of a known investor at founders fund then he started he's a known [ __ ] like people think he's a total [ __ ] on twitter super hilarious to follow because he's a just absolute jerk to people um you know his like number one tweet is just like wrong the period and he won't tell you why he won't argue back he just calls you an idiot and then if you like try to argue he's like this is why i'm i was more successful at the age of 27 than you are at 40. and he just like rips people like that and like who does that that's nobody does that so i think that's just like really crazy and entertaining to me um but anyways he's doing so he did open door and what open door is is now is like a publicly listed company because it did us back and open door's a multi-billion dollar company and basically it was like selling your house is a time consuming and stressful process what if like the day you want to sell you could just sell your house right away give you a price you say yes or no and that's what opendoor did so they basically would just buy your house and then they had a lot of data to know how much to buy your house for and then they were the brokers they could keep the broker fee for themselves buying and selling and then they would sell it within like 90 days hopefully and they do this in a whole bunch of markets like arizona and stuff like that and so they've done very well you know kind of like on paper and like zillow now like does the same thing to try to compete with them they kind of changed the way that the the business model of these big real estate companies worked where now like the money to be made is in basically like auto buying your bit auto buying your house and then reselling it for you and using a bunch of technology to do that anyways his new company he's starting uh with with jack abraham is uh called open store and so we have open door and now you have open store i no they haven't released a bunch of details but i think i know what it is which is it is open door for buying businesses so it's the same idea for buying i think it's going to be specialized in online businesses but maybe not um where basically you just say here's my business and then they say here's your offer we'll buy it off you and and so i don't know if this is going to be specialized like e-commerce roll-ups like a thrasio um i don't know if it's going to be online and offline like uh where did you learn about this and what what can i go is there a website yet uh they announced it so i heard about it a few weeks ago like six weeks ago maybe and i was like oh that's super interesting how did you hear about this so somebody told me about it because their friend interviewed at the company and so that's like the only way you could know about it because like when you interview they like kind of tell you the premise of the company and that guy was like oh dude you know keith was doing a new thing it's basically open door for bit buying businesses and i was like oh that's sick that's a great idea because buying but selling your business is also just like is even more than buying a home in terms of time consuming stressful uncertain on what price you're going to get uncertain what price it even should be and um and the marketplace is to do that online like buy biz buy biz sell or whatever that website is like dot com buy business sell they're so like old school you know like on how they do that and so um so i think there's like room for improvement there so i found that to be really interesting let me bring this up real quick which is it's so crazy how often internet marketers who often are accused of being sleazy and many of them are i mean they're accused of being that because they are but they're often ahead of the game so for example email marketing email newsletters are all the rage right now uh scammy guys like i don't think this guy's actually scamming me but david d'angelo used to sell dating books in the 1990s by having these long emails i just stole and copied from him um the other thing is paid memberships paid memberships have been a thing for decades now guys like greg your friend our friend greg is doing a paid community thing and greg's like a cool guy um and so it's like it's like cool to do it um and there's so many more and this is another one buying and selling businesses online has been a thing that internet marketers so for example flippa where you could buy affiliate websites that's been a thing for years empire flippers is another one yeah empire builders and if you go as empire flippers or empire builders i think those are actually two but they but if you go to those websites you're gonna a lot of people are gonna be immediately turned off you're gonna think what the [ __ ] is this and [ __ ] startup guys like us we just come in i guess that's what we are we just come in and we take the stuff that these guys have been doing for years and we just say put some lipstick on it yeah one 2.0 make it a flat beautiful color uh it's so funny because like cool this sounds neat but this isn't unique right uh yeah i think you know there's no unique ideas really there's you know remixes of ideas there's old ideas that you make new there's new platforms but but i think it's cool and i think it could be big uh it's one i'm gonna keep my eye on then i saw another business like this so i started to put together a little bit of a pattern here and i said oh what is open door for x so what other parts of life and and uh in the world could use instant liquidity because that's what this is it's basically taking something that was kind of illiquid like your house and it takes a lot of time to get liquid where you actually sell the thing and takes a lot of pr you know you got to like you got to move out you got to stage it you got to repaint it you got to get a broker you got to list it you got to do tours no instant liquidity we buy your house today don't do any of that [ __ ] um same thing with your buying your business what else needs that and then i saw another one and this business is called um i grabbed the name but it's basically doing this for used electronics it's called backflip just got funded and backflip is basically saying we'll instantly buy any of your used electronics and uh because that's not a new thing either and and i think it's awesome and so it's not that it's new it's basically that there is a big swing being taken by people who are going to try to do this at scale using like the modern kind of internet marketing and models to do it and so like you know like we buy gold or whatever what else those billboards cards you know like gift cards yeah exactly like um and there's like a gift card there's actually a gift card startup that's crushes uh that that basically took the old bottle and just doesn't know what's it called raise i think raised yeah i'm i'm on their website right now i'm looking at raise.com holy [ __ ] i can look at the traffic and just tell you these guys are printing money yeah raise is gonna be like a billion dollar plus win uh and nobody even like hears about this company nobody talks about this company but you know super simple business of like you know gift cards the gift card business resale of gift cards essentially and so uh so anyways i'm interested in this open door for x which is basically instant liquidity for things that were pretty interesting all right let's play off that so houses okay there's equity zen which i think is badass uh so equities then let's see what he's in kind of looks more like flippa than it does like open door meaning like it's kind of hard to get in it's kind of obtuse you got to like sign up to see [ __ ] not everything is there it's like a 10-step process to do an investment it's like equity zen is not like it's not robin hood on my phone where i can just like do my thing and so like secondary shares yeah it's like a shitty name like i don't know like it's just bad all around and forge global is the other one it's like also bad i don't know i feel like somebody can do this better carter is trying to carter x is trying to do this better um right now which is like secondary shares of private companies yeah i'm not a fan of carta but um i could see them doing well but i'm not i'm not a fan of carter so i don't know if i want them to be the best at this um angel is also trying to do it there's a bunch of people trying to do this second trying to do open door trying to do what they're trying to do is a little bit different they're just still trying to do the marketplace what opendoor did was different it wasn't like open door wasn't just another housing marketplace it was i will buy the thing off you right now because i know what i can sell it for um and i'll i'm comfortable with this five percent spread that i will i will keep so you give up five percent of your upside but you get the certainty of it being done now and i'm comfortable in that five percent spread so somebody would need to do this for secondary shares would they just go you want to sell your your company stock done and then i will figure out how to re-flip this thing on the other side with my own spread so there's a few people that have done this with furniture and furniture's really hard because furniture doesn't ship well yeah um but there is if you i don't know if you know i mean i buy i like buying used furniture because you can get like 10 000 couches for like three grand um and what's oftentimes they're really nice used furniture is not really a thing on the internet uh or at least it's not hugely popular but you could i think there is still an interesting way you can do this with used furniture right um so i think training cards is one so i know a lot of people that have sports cards they collect it as a kid it's in their attic somewhere it's in a box they kind of heard of cards are worth something but they don't like they don't know what they have they don't know what it's worth they don't have them graded they didn't send them into psa and pay the money to get them graded so i think if somebody basically did the shoebox model where you basically say put it all in the shoebox and mail it to us and we will pay you for it uh we'll do all the work of figuring out what it's worth and then we'll pay you you know 70 cents on the dollar for for what it's worth and like today you're getting nothing for it and like that that's the and if you don't like our offer we'll send it back and i think that somebody did that they could just hoover up all the long tail of like trading cards that are out there um that people are not doing anything with that they want to monetize that's interesting okay so uh we've we've furniture is not that good trading cards pretty interesting because it's a lot easier cars everyone a lot of people do cars carvana does cars and i think that that is so sick they're a multi-billion dollar is that the same model they use where they'll just instantly buy your car off you yeah like they'll buy it in a matter of minutes which if you told me this like years ago i'd be like no way that can't be done but they made uh 5.6 billion dollars last year in sales so it works okay so it's working open door for cars working yeah yeah it totally works um what else is interesting what's a huge thing like what's what are some of the bigger assets that you possibly have in your life that you want to wow carvana's market cap is 45 billion dollars holy [ __ ] yeah it's working um what else is there i don't know there's gonna be some obscure [ __ ] like oh like life insurance policy payouts or something or like you know like something like that that i'm like i don't even know that space but that makes sense it takes you know it's something that you get or like social security like i know like my parents are getting to the age where they can collect social security like would they take a lump sum of all their social security now and you know at at 70 cents or 72 cents on the dollar and then you know this company just collects the the payments over time like probably i don't know like there's a lot of people who would make that trade dude did you know this so there's this uh a company i have to go and look at what it is but you guys could probably google it actually but i think some banks do it like goldman will do it but if you have a winning lottery ticket they'll buy it off you right and they'll give you the money up front and it's structured in such a way where they're they're still able to make their profit but they'll buy lottery tickets from you like we're talking like 10 million dollar lottery tickets or seven figures uh i i uh it's kind of interesting people buy winning lottery tickets off of people that's actually kind of an interesting one um i would actually need to do some research how many people do how much money do you think is won in the lottery per year oh dude i have no idea i mean i feel like the weekly lottery the powerball every week is like you know between 50 and like 200 million dollars it's like it's like that's that's like on a weekly basis that it's so now it doesn't get one every week that's how it accrues and that's how it gets bigger but like you know i don't know you have the number in front of you i feel like it's i don't know no i i uh no i i can't find it there there's 1600 lotteries created each year so there's at least 1600 unique winners um no i don't i don't have the numbers but lottery tickets might actually be kind of interesting because you said the life insurance i'm like what do you wait to get paid for that you would take a discounted upfront payment lotteries is kind of is actually kind of interesting um and i do know that some banks actually do that right you know who else does that is whitey bulger you remember whitey bulger i've never even heard that those words in my life do you do you know the movie that departed yes you know jack nicholas's character okay yes it's modeled after whitey bulger he was a gangster in uh boston he was an italian or an irish mafia guy he uh mobster guy he ended up going to jail recently they found him and they um um he got beat to death in jail so it was like a crazy ending to the story of him he was america's most wanted man for like 20 years and um anyway he as part of his story he won the lottery three times and the way that he did it is people who had won the lottery that in the neighborhood they would have to go to him and he would buy it from you and he would go and cash the ticket and uh so this is like a fame like the numbers game they call it that it's like a famous mafia thing wow okay i had no idea um yes i don't know maybe if people have good ideas on what what part of life could use instant liquidity i'm curious to see to see what that that would be um okay so a couple other things i wanted to bring up one is a pain point or kind of a business opportunity maybe this exists if it exists tell me because i want to use this service so in e-commerce most e-commerce brands are just local in their own geographies and most are let's say most u.s ecommerce brands basically just sell in the u.s and then it takes time and then you start selling in canada and then you start selling in europe and then you know but it takes a long time and the reason it takes a long time is because of the like international logistics so for example you want to ship something to canada they have to pay like pretty heavy duty like a import duty on the product so you sell like a 50 product they're gonna have to pay like 20 of import taxes in addition to the shipping so it just becomes like irresponsible to buy uh and still some customers do because they can only get the product from the us-based company but it really sucks and then the company has to like fill out this form that says these goods are worth 14 and then you submit that at the thing and it's just annoying right and so i think there should be a company so there's these brands trying to do these e-commerce roll-ups i think you should do it differently i think some enterprising entrepreneur can basically say look i will boot up your canadian operation today i'll boot up your uk operation your france operation yeah i'll do europe i'll do uk i'll do um australia whatever right so basically say i'll import your brand today you do no work so all you have to do is you need to ship me this product to this warehouse so here's the address ship me your products uh i need like you know whatever your normal inventory is ship 10 to me and let's see how i do and basically you get one giant warehouse where you're warehousing for all the brands that you're going to work with and you just say look in exchange for doing this you pay me no money i will start generating sales for you but i want a royalty i want a royalty of 10 cents or 15 cents for every dollar but what's your point what like how is this how's this interesting or new uh because i don't know of a brand that does this that exists so you know my wife has an e-commerce brand we sell in the us i would love to be making more money by selling in europe but the time the operational overhead to go to europe right now is just crazy so why aren't there more people that are reaching out to ecommerce store owners and basically saying i will run your international operation and make it a low risk to no risk proposition for them in order to do so and i think there's a lot of money to be made given the number of e-commerce brands in the us and how you could if you're in brazil or you're in australia or you're in canada or wherever i think you could become the leading trusted like kind of like we're we are your canada go to canada go to market plan for canada and we just do all the work for you this is actually quite common in media so there's business insider india there's business insider australia there's business insider germany i believe um and then uh um i think i believe the wall street journal does the same thing for those same countries but there is buzzfeed france uh huffpo france huffpo australia it's actually pretty common in media um and obviously so so is it run out of the us or they hire a team there or it's a local team there that just licenses the brand basically when they report the revenue it's under licensing and so i don't exactly know what that means though because i was trying i was thinking about us and i was like man we have a lot of people who are uh english as a second language folks uh in germany so like uh i guess germany i guess is one of the most populous i don't know i don't know numbers i guess it's one of the most populous places in europe it's uh very business focused so you know the germans liked us um same with australia australians loved us and i was like yeah let's go do it but what the [ __ ] do i do do i just fly over there and just start recruiting like it's it's crazy i would love to partner with them and then another thing is in particular china and japan and there's actually a whole word for this there's a word i can't remember what the word is but there's a word that describes why it's difficult to break into japan um and the reason is is that the one it's hard to break into an island in particular japan and i would love to have paid someone to be like hey can you be my japanese uh yeah consecuti like my my capo on the ground those are all mob terms because i'm into the mafia now uh can you be my my guy on the street of japan and let me know is this good am i getting the right people i think that's incredibly interesting yeah exactly so i'm i'm not saying that this doesn't exist i'm saying there's still a lot of room there because i know a lot of people i have a lot of friends who are doing e-commerce right we host club ltv there's you know 75 to 100 e-commerce brands each doing over a million dollars a year in there and every single one of them i think has the same problem which is that we're all u.s focused and why are we us focused because it would be too much of a lift too much of a lift to go figure out how to do australia it's too small of a pie to like do manpower on or spend brain power on but if somebody in australia was like hey look this is what we do this is our business model we help you get sales here and we just take our cut and uh and so i just think that like there needs to there's there's more opportunity for this and that's cool that in media it sounds like there's also an opportunity to do it media too or being done in some way by the big players it's being done in some way but like i remember when buzzfeed uh like we're going through some troubles they had a layoff like their whole french office and i was like buzzfeed has a french office what the [ __ ] well that's the opposite right that's we have a french office and then you have to do things like that when it's like not working out i'm saying no investment no consulting fees you just take a royalty on sales and these are all incremental sales that i wasn't getting otherwise and you take care of the whole operational headache in this case for e-commerce about like i just ship your goods to your warehouse you ship it to local customers customers don't have to overpay customers don't have to do import duties uh for every order they make and so i just think that there's a opportunity in e-commerce to like be the the go-to brand for every dtc brand to partner with in each of these locales what country would you go to next um i think europe is probably the best because you want um what the you know the next wealthiest high populous place um but really it can work anywhere it's just like the biggest market is doing it you know throughout europe now europe is made up of so many countries maybe that's a pain in the ass if not like canada's the no-brainer australia next japan is a good one um those would be the ones india maybe like for example i know a bunch of people in india who did this so uh my dad introduced me to these guys and i was like oh wow why is these guys how their house is humongous how you know what do they do it's like oh yeah they um they partnered with jockey underwear and they just became the jockey like seller here they have exclusive rights to sell jockey in india next guy at the dinner table what do you do oh we're the dominoes guys in india what yeah we're the exclusive franchisee of dominoes for india um okay what does that mean well we have like indians didn't really eat pizza before this so we're like teaching people to eat pizza they [ __ ] love it turns out and so we have like you know 9 000 dominoes throughout india now like oh my god what is going on here it's like you know local franchisee but for what's this called what's the terminol what's the term for this i don't know you know maybe i should have gone to business school i think it's probably just like in brick and mortar i think it's just called franchising um franchising was the way to sp spread geographically you know when your brick and mortar can only scale so fast uh that's how you would do it you would franchise out and then the franchise would pay a royalty back to the back to the master franchise of the brand uh of their sales and they're the local operator but with e-commerce or with digital media it's a little bit different but it kind of has the same problem so i don't know if there's a new word for it man i think this is wildly fascinating this is i didn't think it was that interesting at first but now i know what you're talking about where uh i've heard so many stories of the same thing but not maybe not of india but i am the official uh importer of x y and z yeah we're the distributor of x or like for you just think about for your business right like would could you have sold for more if you had like 250 000 you know or like 500 000 subscribers in japan and like dude i think there's a world where i would have been where i could have made more money in those markets than i did in america because even though america has more people um i don't think the french or i don't think that the germans um i don't think facebook kicks as much ass over there as it does here with instagram and everything and so i think the ad markets because i i do think that europe sorry europeans if you're listening i do think that you guys are five or ten years behind when it comes to some technology stuff um and the ad markets suck because of facebook and google so like if you could still capture a little bit of that revenue i think you could well i don't know if any of that's true but what i do know is that it's true trust me as you're building well i think like everybody uses facebook everywhere so that's the part i'm saying i don't know um well sorry but what i mean is like old media still does quite well abroad okay that's fair that's fair uh the thing i'm just saying is like if while you were building your us business and all your employees are focused on your u.s business if somebody said i love your product i'd love to license the brand from you or or i'd love to be your partner in in the uk or in japan or in australia and i will build i will use the same playbook it'll be under your company i just want my cut for building this for you because i'm going to private you would have done it in a heartbeat right and so the fact that you didn't means there was an opportunity for some entrepreneur that should have been reaching out to you saying this is a no-lose proposition you still own it you still make money off of it it's still your name brand i just get to go i get to basically take your brand take your head take your product and localize it or distribute it here where i am from and i know the market yeah and my product's way easier than yours it was cause it's pixels it's not anything real and i would have loved to have done that and i used to have people emailing me all the time and then we had a bunch of people in russia some people in mexico who would just verbatim copy our [ __ ] and i would say i would have to i'd find it and i'd be like you guys stop this dude you're not allowed to do this and then i'd have other people who would email me be like hey can i try could you stop anyone from doing that i feel like you can't do [ __ ] if somebody takes your newsletter and they just word for word transcribe it in russia and they're like we're called whatever how hustle are you no there's nothing you could do the only thing that i was able to do the only thing i was able to do we had someone do this an uh italian we had somebody in russian and we had someone do it in mexico uh yeah mexico and i basically shamed them i said like i'm just gonna i'm just going to call you out and so i would tweet at them or i would email them uh i would just would make it well known and my network was large enough that someone of someone knew them and they were embarrassed and they yeah and they stopped doing it but no i didn't do [ __ ] yeah and i had people email me all the time saying hey can i do this for uh spain and i would say yeah but i don't really know anything about you i don't know if you've got good taste i don't like i don't i know nothing about you and i would just throw it off to the side and just kind of forget about it i wish i would have i'm surprised this doesn't happen more i'm surprised there's not just like freemedia.com based in cyprus that basically takes all the content from behind the paywall of wall street journal and just says cool if you ever hit a paywall come here look like input put the url you're trying to go to here's the article for free i'm surprised somebody hasn't just tried to do that like it's totally bootleg it's piracy right but like it is so hard to enforce that stuff i can't believe that somebody internationally isn't doing that that seems like the way to do it do you know what outlined.com is i know about it and i know i don't know what i could say publicly about it but uh yeah i know explain it i don't have any insider information so maybe you do i i don't i'll explain why so outline.com it's uh the tagline is read and annotate without distractions frankly i have no idea what that means but the way that i use it and the way that everyone else uses it is when you come across a paywall website you put the url into outline.com and you can see the whole article um it just it doesn't work for everything i don't think it works for new york times but uh you can get you can get like i think a bunch of bunch of sites they they kind of stopped working on but initially it worked on everything and uh the person behind this is somebody we know that's like a well-known kind of tech person that works at one of the big companies and was like they had to like distance themselves it was getting like millions of hits like people were using this thing they had to distance themselves from it because they were like uh yeah like i was kind of told i had to knock it off he's like i didn't make it for that purpose it just it works that way but uh yeah is it a brazilian no sight oh my god oh okay i uh yeah yeah i see yeah i know who you're talking about how interesting outland.com what the heck it's that big i just googled it uh or i just looked at a similar way about how big it was outlined.com crazy fascinating yeah so so i think that one's cool um all right i'll bray you how did we do on the wait hold on yeah just a quick question does outline.com make money uh i don't think so i don't know i have no idea wow this person is so interesting all right uh that's it that's the episode uh by the way for the people listening we actually just did like a q a before this it was sean i think it was too much talking we got to do the q and a in the second half because oh yeah i'm [ __ ] exhausted right now but like i feel like there's so much drain from my body right now no if we're going to do two hours again we have to do the i'm trying to be lifting in the front i tried to keep the energy high but like in my brain and i also haven't eaten anything today so i'm just like dying on all fronts right now i'm hurting i'm hurting yeah q a is going to be a separate episode dude so we are we're getting two episodes out of this yeah we gotta i can't do it next time yeah yeah i thought we would be able to but yes this is painful maybe this is hard instead of the way for another one tomorrow yeah i can do another one tomorrow i can do i can do one a day easy uh i think i think i can yeah we'll have to try something else if we want to keep doing the q and a's i like that one i thought the q a was almost better than the actual episode maybe because you guys were tired but the q a came out a lot better than i thought i think people are gonna like both of those yeah no the whole thing is good so good job guys i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road less travel never looking back

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
one interesting thing that i found so what i like to do is i like to find out who um is buying different parts of real estate or different real estate so i go to the realdeal.com and there's this one segment called yolanda says it's like this fake author name yolanda he goes i heard a rumor that this person's buying a house the owner is this this and this yolanda hears that um they're gonna offer this much money i have no idea jolan is a fake person right it's just like a blog a blog website gossip blog yeah for real estate mostly in new york and la though so they're kind of famous famous e-purse people doing it and what i love to do is find out who bought who's buying the real estate and then i go and research them and the reason why is one of the best ways to figure out if someone's actually wealthy or not is by the real estate holdings that they own that's one of the few things that it's really hard to fake i mean you could fake it but if someone has bought a 20 million dollar home the likelihood that they're worth 100 million plus is incredibly high um you know it's hard to like that right and so real estate holdings is one of the best way to get an indicator of someone's wealth or it's a great way not the best way but it's a great way and i found one that interested me a ton this guy's name was brian carringer and he uh bought a house in malibu in 2019 for 20 million dollars i hadn't heard brian i know a lot of internet entrepreneurs um i hadn't heard of them so i researched them and this is the guy who started dictionary.com kind of a crazy thing when you think about it because who really thinks of dictionary dictionary.com so in the 1990s this guy started uh in 1995 he started a business called lexico publishing and lexico publishing owned the thesaurus.com and dictionary.com and he bootstrapped it and he grew and he sold it in 2005 to iac for a hundred million dollars and then uh two years ago iac sold dictionary.com to dan gilbert you know dan gilbert quicken loans yep he sold dictionary.com for uh or they sell dictionary.com for a hundred million dollars so they they didn't do a very good job with it but dictionary.com gets around 40 dictionary.com and thesaurus.com gets around 40 million uniques a month and does about 20 million in revenue and they have barely any employees i i believe dozens of employees it's incredibly fascinating because this is the one i call it how do they make money it's just adsense or is there something else just ads i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on a road less travel never looking back

let's talk about jack first okay so we have a friend jack butcher who is uh he's behind this account that's kind of very popular on twitter called visualize value he himself was kind of like a designer background so very like kind of artistic guy and um by the way every time i say artistic i think i'm about to say autistic and so i have to like you know catch myself each time make sure i didn't call them autistic so it could be that who knows well actually the thing about jack is he's very smooth very very low-key nicest guy in the world and uh i i met i met jack a year ago a year ago i contacted him and asked him to do this design stuff and then he was just up and coming right and sarah and i my wife became friends with jack and his wife and we they spent thanksgiving with us down here in austin where uh they just had a baby and we've been friends with them talking all that stuff and he did his story is that he used to live in new york city him and his wife he's british he he came here 10 years ago they shared a one bedroom or sorry a studio apartment that was 400 square feet and he was they were nothing i mean they were they they tried to start an agency business it didn't go so well and they were on their last dollar and this was only like 18 months ago right okay so so he he kind of pivots to basically saying okay within the agency it's work that i do the part that i like and i'm good at and other people don't seem to like what they really want are these like pitch decks i'm making i'm really good at making these slides where it's just a rectangle and i communicate some information on it and so that's where the visualized value brand came from was he was just putting out like a little you know like an image a rectangle that would take a concept and like bring it to life visually and so he started off getting popular by just taking a bunch of naval's popular tweets you know sayings his little kind of one-liners and he would create a graphic out of it and he has this one graphic style you if you're on twitter you've seen it it's just black and white uh it's always a black background with white text on top and a little kind of like very simplistic minimalistic um like graph or chart or drawing on top of it okay so that's visualized value so he does like the normal creator thing he gets a little bit of an audience his twitter grows to a hundred thousand people he creates a course he creates kind of like a paid community for people who want to learn this thing and he's doing well for himself right and that's where we met everybody and he he he's it does he does north of a million dollars a year in revenue and the only uh expenses are like the small software stuff and then him and his wife exactly and um so he's doing he's doing very well for himself right but it's all relative she's doing much better now so what happened um this craze around nfts came out and if you don't know what nfts is just think of it like digital art that people buy and uh crypto people people really like it because it's virtual art in the same way that crypto is sort of like a virtual money or a digital money so anyways jack starts doing nfts so jack basically takes his same art that he's posting on twitter for free and he's like no now you can own this piece of art so now you can own this post that i'm putting up and so he just dabbles you know just does an experiment i don't know what the first one sold for i think it was like one ether right uh one when he used two two or three thousand dollars it was like yeah just close to two grand and uh it was like 1.5 ether or something like that so it's like two or three thousand bucks still pretty sweet right like this is just a you know dot png file that he otherwise uploads to twitter for free and now somebody wanted to own the dot png file because their fans are his and this meant something to them and they had a bunch of crypto gains that they could reinvest their chucky cheese money right and so um okay so now he's like stepping it up so we'll fast forward he does some more nfts he releases another nft this one gets bid up and gets bought for 33 eth which is i think something like um what is 33e 338 times like 70 grams like 70 grand so he sells one of his images for 70 grand and i called him right when i saw that i go jack is this real did someone he goes yeah it's crazy mate that's all i said right right exactly because he's not like he's not like a schemer in any way but i think he is smart and he is interesting he likes to dabble but like he wasn't he's not trying to pull a quick one he's like putting his art out there and people are buying it and so i actually message the buyer and i go why the heck do you buy this thing it's some random you know random username he just goes oh you know i love jack and i think this is going to appreciate value and i just you know i just really love this like i just love the i love the art and i was like wow okay fantastic so that's the guy bought it for 70 grand so then he did something even crazier which i'm talking about the packs do you know the packs yeah so to explain that one so the the part of the story is the the crazy there's two crazy parts of the story the most recent thing that happened which we'll talk but the first crazy thing is he was like you know what if i did like people love jack he's got a cult following probably more than sean people love sho they used to love me that they moved and what he did was he created a website where you were buying a pack he had 12 packs all it said was pack one pack two pack three it looked like a imagine like a baseball card but with a jack butcher cover on it it was just black and it said visualize value pack one right and you would buy these packs having no idea what the nft art was in it right he had 12 of them and people were bidding on them and each one sold for around 10 to 15 000 which is i thought amazing till we get to the final part of the story or at least the most recent part of the story exactly so he so he gets to today i log on to twitter as i do first thing in the morning uh what's going on in the world tonight holy [ __ ] jack butcher has listed a new piece of art for 76 million dollars something like that what is this what's the exact number 72 76 million he basically and it's called fame and what he did was the most the highest um priced nft thus far in the history of mankind was beeple the the artist people uh who's like jack but even more popular so people had done a a few drops those drops were like kind of in the one to five million range-ish and then the most popular nft of all time was sold for 69 million dollars recently and like there's some rumors that like that was sort of a manufactured sale like somebody came in and did it just to like they're gonna like i don't know these are rumors but rumors were that they kind of made it a publicity stunt so anyways jack uh basically says cool this is a nft called fame and for fame is it it'll be the number one priced uh piece of artwork in a digital artwork in the world right so he prices it above the people i wasn't i wasn't referring to this i was referring to what he did last i didn't even see this this is crazy today last last week what he did was he he wrote he did an nft and it says here's the difference between a uh a jpeg and an nft and it just had a verified it he basically made a tweet and then he sold that tweet for like 150 000 right which i thought was crazy this is way crazier yeah because it's crazier because it might work exactly so okay so let's walk through this if you're jack why i'll tell you why do this and why it might actually work why do this well um if if nothing else this is just a great way to drive attention uh press and um and just do something that's bold right so pricing you know pricing a piece of your artwork for 77 million dollars it doesn't even mean it doesn't even matter if somebody buys it just pricing it for 77 million dollars is uh is already going to put you on the map the second thing is this might be a you know let's say you take the three outcomes somebody actually buys it for 77 million dollars right um there's been crypto punks now the the number one crypto punk sold for oh bro you look this up how much did that crypt the top crypto punk sell for i think it was like seven seven million dollars something like that people sold for 69 million so there is a chance there is a maybe five percent two percent chance that this thing actually sells for 77 million dollars which would be incredible second thing this might be a shoot for the stars you land on the moon situation uh yeah the crypto poke sold for seven and a half million um and the guy who bought it by the way this is kind of cool i don't know how you pronounce this but the person who bought it his handle is perugia or pervugias i don't know what it is i'm not in the art world but that's the same that's an homage basically that's the same name of the guy who stole the mona lisa which is what helped catapult the mona lisa to fame was when it was stolen um and that was like part of the part of what made the mona lisa even more remarkable and more valuable now most valuable piece of artwork in the world um and so so okay so by the way great usage of the word homage yeah thank you um we're trying to class it up right here so all right so so he might not sell it for 77 million but even if it sells for 1.7 million that's 1.7 million dollars that he just you know manufactured through his own creativity and you know and probably i would bet you like four days of effort um i got i have chills looking at this tweet that he put out the reason why this is so crazy is it might work someone might be crazy enough to do this right he basically has a no loss situation and because jack's brand is because he is authentic he is um not kind of like a you know quick flash in the pan trying to make a quick quick dollar like he's literally almost like he's more of an artist really than he is like anything else and so he's been doing this for a while he's been creating daily content he's been building up a following and so just like people did that people did people did a new piece of art every day for 10 years and so it's like you know he's an overnight success 10 years in the making and i think jack's very similar so i see jack having a no lose situation and this is nfts are a thing that basically fits his skill set and so like there's a lot of reasons people kind of [ __ ] on nfts right now one is that it's overvalued it's a bubble what do you really own look i can just screenshot and boom i own the thing too you know like there's a bunch of ways you can make fun of this but one of the good things that came out of this is that um you know in most of these these like kind of hype cycles it's the suits on wall street that get rich uh this time at least it's starving artists that get rich and so you know at the very worst even if the whole thing comes crashing now at least a few artists got paid and you know who could be really too mad at that i i can't so so i think this is kind of like an amazing thing jack's doing this boggles my mind should we ask him to come on do you want jack to come on yeah we should be sure are you friends with him yeah all right not as close as you guys but yeah we're close you should mess with him let's see if he hops on today um just be like you free to come talk about your thing for for five minutes let's see if he hops on at the end of this all right i just texted him all right we'll we'll come we'll come back to that i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
do you see with jacket it's crazy i thought he meant you selling one nft for like a hundred grand i didn't or however much you sold that like what's the difference between a jpeg and an nft thing i didn't see that you have one for 76 million dollars just put it up this morning do you think that's gonna work look at this i love it i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on the road uh just kind of an update on my bitcloud thing that i wanted to talk about but we can do it we can do it later if we want it doesn't have to be at the beginning uh what i would rather you you t you lead it unless you want to talk about jack butcher like we have a ton of like this is all related crazy there's like the world is so weird right now and amongst our friends i think that there's probably a tier or two above but we are in such an odd tier where we have very close friends or you and me a little bit but less so have made a fair amount of money on all of this new stuff happen yeah it's kind of crazy so i'll say if you're tired of us talking about bitcoin and nfts and all the crypto stuff um this is probably not it'll probably skip ahead to the part where we're gonna talk about you know dictionary.com later so so i would say we're gonna go we're gonna show you some range today we're gonna talk about a website that's like 25 years old and then we're going to talk about uh you know a website that's like 25 minutes old which is uh big cloud so let's talk about jack first okay so we have a friend jack butcher who is uh he's behind this account that's kind of very popular on twitter called visualize value he himself was kind of like a designer background so very like kind of artistic guy and um by the way every time i say artistic i think i'm about to say autistic and so i have to like you know catch myself each time make sure i didn't call them autistic so it could be that who knows well actually the thing about jack is he's very smooth very very low-key nicest guy in the world and uh i met i met jack a year ago a year ago i contacted him and asked him to do this design stuff and then he was just up and coming right and sarah and i my wife became friends with jack and his wife and we they spent thanksgiving with us down here in austin where uh they just had a baby and we've been friends with them talking all that stuff and he did his story is that he used to live in new york city him and his wife he's british he he came here 10 years ago they shared a one bedroom or sorry a studio apartment that was 400 square feet and he was they were nothing i mean they were they they were they tried to start an agency business they didn't go so well and they were on their last dollar and this is only like 18 months ago right okay so so he he kind of pivots to basically saying okay within the agency it's work that i do the part that i like and i'm good at and other people don't seem to like what they really want are these like pitch decks i'm making i'm really good at making these slides where it's just a rectangle and i communicate some information on it and so that's where the visualized value brand came from was he's just putting out like a little you know like an image a rectangle that would take a concept and like bring it to life visually and so he started off getting popular by just taking a bunch of naval's uh popular tweets you know sayings his little kind of one-liners and he would create a graphic out of it and he has this one graphic style if you're on twitter you've seen it it's just black and white uh it's always a black background with white text on top and a little kind of like very simplistic minimalistic um like graph or chart or drawing on top of it okay so that's visualized value so he does like the normal creator thing he gets a little bit of an audience his twitter goes to a hundred thousand people he creates a course he creates kind of like a paid community for people who want to learn this thing and he's doing well for himself right and that's where we met very well and he he he's it does he does north of a million dollars a year in revenue and the only uh expenses are like small software stuff and then him and his wife exactly and um so he's doing he's doing very well for himself right but it's all relative she's doing much better now so what happened um this craze around nfts came out and if you don't know what nft is just think of it like digital art that people buy and uh crypto people people really like it because it's virtual art in the same way that crypto is sort of like a virtual money or a digital money so anyways jack starts doing nfts so jack basically takes his same art that he's posting on twitter for free and he's like no now you can own this piece of art so now you can own this post that i'm putting up and so he just dabbles you know just does an experiment i don't know what the first one sold for i think it was like one ether right uh one when he used two two or three thousand dollars yeah just close to two grand and uh it was like 1.5 ether or something like that so it's like two or three thousand bucks still pretty sweet right like this is just a you know dot png file that he otherwise uploads to twitter for free and now somebody wanted to own the png file because they're fans of his and this meant something to them and they had a bunch of crypto gains that they could reinvest their chucky cheese money right and so um okay so now he's like stepping it up so we'll fast forward he does some more nfts he releases another nft this one gets bid up and gets bought for 33 eth which is i think something like um what does 33e 338 times like 70 grand it's like 70 grand so he sells one of his images for 70 grand okay and i called him right when i saw that i go jack is this real did someone he goes yeah it's crazy mate that's all i said right right exactly because he's not like he's not like a schemer in any way but i think he is smart and he is interesting he likes to dabble but like he wasn't he's not trying to pull a quick one he's like putting his art out there and people are buying it and so i actually message the buyer and i go why the heck do you buy this thing it's some random you know random username he just goes oh you know i love jack and i think this is going to appreciate value and i you know i just really love this like i just love the i love the art and i was like wow okay fantastic so that's the guy bought it for 70 grand so then he did something even crazier which i'm talking about the packs do you know the packs yeah so to explain that one so the the part of the story is the the crate there's two crazy parts of the story the most recent thing that happened which we'll talk but the first crazy thing is he was like you know what if i did like people love jack he's got a cult following probably more than sean people love shawn they used to love me then they moved to sean now they love johnny love jack and what he did was he created a website where you were buying a pack he had 12 packs all it said was pack one pack two pack three it looked like a imagine like a baseball card but with a jack butcher cover on it it was just black and it said visualize value pack one right and you would buy these packs having no idea what the nft art was in it

we should leave you hops on today um just be like you free to come talk about your fame thing for for five minutes let's see if he hops on at the end of this all right i just texted him all right we'll we'll come we'll come back to that uh [ __ ] crazy i uh yeah i almost have chills talking about it would it be weird going to a different topic or do you want to stay on nfts and stuff like that um we can do whatever you want is everything less is everything less exciting well i think it's going to go two ways it's going to be if i'm listening to this and i'm most people who are listening to this are kind of like not as knee-deep into this world as we are and and we're still like just kind of dabbling and so the average person is probably not you know familiar with all these things definitely not taking action and definitely not getting rich all these things so there's i think it's going to be kind of polarizing some people are going to think oh wow this is really cool i should go check this out and learn more about this some people are like this is so stupid i think this is all just like you know a giant carnival game that you know some kind of ponzi scheme that i don't want to hear more about so i don't know it's probably polarizing let me move let's do a different one um let's do a different one and we'll only spend about 10 minutes on it and then we're probably going to come back to this all right i actually want to come back to this i want to come back to big cloud i want to talk come back to angel investing okay um okay but someone i i tweeted out that i'm gonna start a youtube channel and someone said you should talk about your research process and that's a really hard thing to talk about but i want to bring up one one topic uh of my research process as well as one interesting thing that i found so what i like to do is i like to find out who um is buying different parts of real estate or different real estate so i go to the realdeal.com and there's this one segment called yolanda says it's like this fake author named yolanda he goes i heard a rumor that this person's buying a house the owner is this this and this yolanda hears that um they're gonna offer this much money i have no idea jolan is a fake person right it's just like a blog a blog website gossip blog yeah for real estate mostly in new york and la though so they're kind of famous famous e-purse people doing it and what i love to do is find out who who's buying the real estate and then i go and research them and the reason why is one of the best ways to figure out if someone's actually wealthy or not is by the real estate holdings that they own that's one of the few things that it's really hard to fake i mean you could fake it but if someone has bought a 20 million home the likelihood that they're worth 100 million plus is incredibly high um you know it's hard to like [ __ ] that right and so real estate holdings is one of the best way to get an indicator of someone's wealth or it's a great way not the best way but it's a great way and i found one that interested me a ton this guy's name was brian carringer and he uh bought a house in malibu in 2019 for 20 million dollars i hadn't heard brian i know a lot of internet entrepreneurs um i hadn't heard of them so i researched them and this is the guy who started dictionary.com kind of a crazy thing when you think about it because who really thinks of dictionary dictionary.com so in the 1990s this guy started uh in 1995 he started a business called lexico publishing and lexico publishing owned the thesaurus.com and dictionary.com and he bootstrapped it and he grew and he sold it in 2005 to iac for a hundred million dollars and then uh two years ago iac sold dictionary.com to dan gilbert you know dan gilbert of quicken loans yep he sold dictionary.com for uh or they sell dictionary.com for 100 million dollars so they they didn't do a very good job with it but dictionary.com gets around 40 dictionary.com and thesaurus.com gets around 40 million uniques a month and does about 20 million in revenue and they have barely any employees i i believe dozens of employees it's incredibly fascinating because this is what i call how do they make money it's just adsense or is there something else just ads all it is is ads and it's an incredibly interesting company because it's one of the things that i call a for it you can let's call it i call it a forgotten property like just things that you forget that even exist but just quietly make money and are quite repeatable they're not like necessarily sexy um it's like the sweaty startup of internet yeah yeah you know if sweaty startup means a lot landscaping business this is kind of like that for the internet sure um and but they've done a really good job of staying relevant so they do a word of the day which people like particularly love like it's a huge email list of we just get the word of the day they also do a word of a year word of the word uh of the year so when donald trump was president in 2016 i think the word of the year was xenophobic because a lot of people were searching what xenophobic means right uh this past year in 2020 it was pandemic and it was it's almost like a recap of the year and it's actually kind of culturally relevant and also what they do is when someone like kendall gender or kylie jenner whatever the woman is who is quote self-made they they'll do funny stuff like they'll tweet the definition they'll retweet a tweet of her calling herself self-made and they'll they'll say actually the definition of self self-made is success unaided or something like that like they like they're pretty snarky i find this to be incredibly interesting um because it's something i didn't think about and that's kind of cool yeah you went from 100 to zero real quick there at the end yeah uh okay so we actually had a friend who was looking at buying dictionary.com you know about this no we had a friend that was looking at buying dictionary.com and merging it with another business i can't remember the name of it now urbandictionary.com is another big one that one gets about 40 or 50 million uniques a month and who owns that wait uh just a guy a guy in san francisco aaron peckham so there's a similar uh and you wrote another one on here that that's similar to me which is chess.com and so yeah i don't know as much about it as you do so fill in the gaps but i was looking at it i was like oh man chess.com is a great domain uh chess is this kind of like very quiet you know just like super sticky you know just relevant it's a classic game right it's just been relevant for so long and then with queen's gambit it got like way more popular recently there's all these crazy charts spiking the trends of people searching for chess chess boards check how to get good at chess like what is queen's gambit how do you do a queens gambit all those things and so it had they have 200 employees i bet you it's worth if you told me i heard a rumor they're thinking about selling and i would bet it would be worth a quarter of a billion dollars exactly that's that's what i was going to say they have a huge amount of traffic what's their traffic monthly it's uh i don't i'll look it up but they have around 50 million registered users right and they're not just like it's not flyby traffic like dictionary.com thesource.com they're going to have a lot more traffic but it's going to be fly by 200 200 million monthly uniques according to similar web most of which is direct incredible right and so 200 million they make money way more though do you know how they make money no i well i can guess tell me if i'm right so i would guess that basically they sell some kind of you know course tutorial a way to get better at chess do they do that yeah and so you can meet with coaches and you can pay coaches money right can they do they also have some kind of like premium pro membership where you get matched with better people and your stats get saved and something like that yep yep okay so so dead simple business model around a classic game that nobody owns the ip to right it's not like saying um monopoly well you can't do monopoly somebody owns monopoly you know i don't know who hasbro or whoever owns monopoly you can do it with chess and this is one of the reasons why we talked about religion as a really interesting fun uh you know fundamental or like base layer for any business because nobody owns religion but it's a highly recognized brand with super high affinity so i love businesses that are you know like prey the app that's you know basically calm for for christianity or there's versions of this for the muslim religion and so i love religion as one of the primary substrates because you have a billion people who know about it but uh nobody owns the ip so you can use the ip and so what what what was our friend gonna do who who i wonder who our friend is so i don't remember exactly i don't know how much we could really talk about it but they were gonna basically buy two properties at the same time dictionary.com and one other one and because they were like look dictionary.com gets a ton of traffic but it's not so sticky of a service it doesn't really have a great monetization potential it's just display display ads and then this other thing is a great business model and has um uh you know has great stickiness and maybe we merged the two like let's just okay here's a hypothetical i don't know if this is exactly what they said but if you're grammarly would you pay for would you go buy dictionary.com and thesaurus right because you're going to go get 50 60 million people coming to look up words and find out what words mean and you can say hey by the way if you you know if you ever feel like you want to sharpen up with this maybe you should uh install grammarly which is a great way to write you know choose better vocab write write perfect grammar and become a better writer right like they have a business model attached to it that that that makes sense and so i wonder if there were other things like that maybe i would if i was grammarly i would maybe buy dictionary.com um i just thought it was interesting because you don't really think about this another one that i've been i'm going to do research on is easyjiff.com do you know that i know that one yes i actually so i have a slack channel called buyouts in my slack and uh i just have my slack with ben and we have a slack of buyouts which is basically company uh websites that i think would be awesome to buy easy jif was the first one i ever put in that that channel because i was like oh my god i love this i love this simple tool that gets a ton of traffic it's zero to no maintenance and uh and it makes money you know remove.bg is another one like that uh where you can just remove the background of a photo and then you pay for credits so it's like you don't need to know photoshop to remove the background of a photo and i just think that's genius so easyjiff.com it's the letters e the letter z and then jiffgif.com eight million uniques a month you go there and you upload a uh video and it turns it into a gif uh i was doing research on it looks like the guy it looks like it's only one uh a small team a couple people um made in latvia uh uh lots if i'm dictionary.com uh one thing that they should do is they should take a page out of the new york times playbook so i don't know if you've you probably have because you're in the you know you're in media you care about the stuff but most people aren't aware of how new york times really makes money what it what its business looks like today and a pretty large part of their business i i haven't done the research because it's off top of my head but very large i know tens of millions of dollars a year i believe comes from their games division particularly one game crossword and so um i play this game every single day the new york times mini crossword it is uh literally a two-minute game that like kind of stimulates the brain and it's fun to do and it requires like no kind of hand-eye coordination type of thing and it's not you can't get super addicted to it because it's like one a day um so the mini crossword is like they took the crossword which is a big part of the papers okay now the paper's all digital how do we make a digital version of the crossword and then they made it mini so that it's actually like simpler for the average person to do you can like pretty much always win and um super fun game and so the i don't know what the the other revenue numbers of crossword and in the game so keep on going so if i'm dictionary.com that's you know whoever's the ceo of dictionary.com hey free idea that i think would generate probably eight to ten million dollars a year you should come out with your take all these popular uh games like word scramble or mini crossword or um you know all these different little word word puzzle games that are very popular in the app store and they have trouble with distribution good games trouble with distribution all you need to do is reskin that as the dictionary.com game and put it as a pop-up for people coming to the site to hey download this fun game and uh you know even if you're converting you know half a percent of your traffic to this thing you're gonna end up driving a lot of revenue because this game is these games work and all they need is distribution and maybe people who come to diction.com or they subscribe to the word of the day email like i think they would like to play these little word games they're very popular even my mom plays these little word scramble games okay so uh some information on new york times new york times is a publicly traded company so this is where i'm getting some of the numbers but i don't always break out the revenue by segment so i'm doing a little bit of guesstimation but i would bet i'm right within 10 to 20 percent um so in 2020 new york times said they had 600 000 people paying for the crossword puzzle only just crossword puzzle that was in 2020 2020 was a huge year for uh subscribe subscription remember everything's actually yeah everything doubles but let's just round that up to eight hundred thousand for six hundred thousand so eight hundred thousand i believe it cost six dollars and ninety five cents a month for a crosswind puzzle but so let's run that up to seven dollars so seven dollars times eight hundred thousand we're looking at 5.6 million dollars a month 60 million or uh 67 million dollars a year in subscription revenue only from crossfit puzzles right that's it that's just the crossfit puzzle division right [ __ ] crazy right right exactly uh and they're like i read an article recently uh where the guy was like you know someone from the new york times was like yeah we're quadrupling down on games games exploded during kovid crossword is already an amazing franchise for us the next they have another game i forgot what it is but they have like you know a few staple games that are like these classics and they're like you know we're we're actually a games company the guys literally said that he goes you know we we don't just you know just put the game the same exact game on a phone we like kind of reinvent it so that it's like even more fun on your phone we try to like put a twist on the game we're not just going to come out with you know the classic you know like for example 2048 if you ever played that little numbers game where you slide the tiles and it like you know it adds up to 2048 um the game's awesome and so new york times can come out with a version of 2048 which is like um you know their own twist on the game so i found that to be pretty interesting and that's what i would do if i was dictionary.com um so in this segment the takeaway should be learn about real estate and read the real deal and google all the entrepreneurs and the reason why you do that is you're going to discover stuff like dictionary thesaurus.com and you're eventually going to learn about crossfit puzzles and the reason why this is important what we're discussing is just interesting stuff but the reason why this is all important is we are showing that you can make a killing a [ __ ] killing hundreds of millions of dollars to the point where you're buying a 20 million dollar home on the beachfront of malibu more than most celebrities will ever be able to afford and you're doing it by building something that you're just like it starts as like a silly thing that you never would have thought could actually become this big and when you see this stuff it actually inspires you and or at least it inspires me knowing that like i can turn something silly into something profitable and that's a badass that is awesome just knowing that that's possible it is cool it's kind of like why does everyone why did five people break the four minute mile in the same year when previously no one had done it it's because when you see what's possible it it it pushes the boundary and it and it shows you what you can do that's neat to me so we should also say uh so two things that i took away from that you are really good at figuring out uh like you sniff out these little interesting stories because you just think who's that guy how does he drive that car how much is that car yeah how'd you get that money right and actually there's a famous tick tock channel that just does only this i don't know if you used to but he goes up to people getting out of like lamborghinis or like you know like just killer cars and just be like hey man uh what do you do for a living and the guy's like what and he just said yo well what do you do for a living i just i'm curious you guys like i'm in real estate real estate cool man and he just leaves right listen that's it yeah it kind of bothers them for a second and then you know the person will be like you know i'm a cannabis entrepreneur i'm uh you know i'm a hedge fund guy i uh i'm a youtuber i'm a whatever right well uh the joke of that channel is the people say one of two things the women say i'm a wife yeah and they like are joking and then they also or they'll say i sell drugs right right exactly and then they like zoom away um and so so i love that channel at first i think that's just like a really simple fun idea for a tick tock channel and then um but but there is some like kind of merit to that and it's really helped me in life which is basically anytime you see somebody who's got an interesting lifestyle i like to figure out two things one is is your whole day like this what's your day like what do you do how do you do that and i like to see how people architect their life right like and that sort of like it's like like you said about the four minute mile it opens your mind to what's possible so recently i got this like a private chef person who's like making meals for me they don't they don't come to my house they don't make food in my house but it's like a delivery service meal prep service but let's call it a private chef right because it's not doordash it's somebody who's giving me a menu or giving feedback yeah you're doing the same because i'm doing it you know trying to be fit you're trying to do this for the same reason you want to eat healthier and hey if you can afford it that's a convenient way to do it right where you know you got the the p word privilege to be able to do it and so uh the reason i think that's even possible or i realized that was because the investor in my last company he had a private chef that was like a former michelin star chef at a restaurant this guy elgin amazing chef who was like would be in his house and he would make you know lunch and dinner for them every single night and i was like whoa i didn't even realize people have that and it's not that oh you know i want that but it's i didn't even realize that's a possibility of a lifestyle that you could have it is a upgraded part of your life and so there's all these little examples i've i've had in my life of like like i have a cousin who has like a virtual assistant in the philippines and i asked him how do you do what do you do with that how do you set it up how did you find the right person right just get real curious about different people's lifestyles and how they architect how they design their life and you kind of you can pick and choose from there what works for you what you want out of your life the second thing is why did the guy behind dictionary.com like make it work right because it's like kind of a simple idea well he was early to a platform right so to get the domain dictionary.com you couldn't do that today but you could do it when the web was early and not everybody believed which is a perfect segue back to bitcloud new platforms by the way speaking of big clout uh i texted jack while we were talking he's going to be joining any second now oh perfect um so we brought this up on the last podcast because ryan beagleman came on a friend of ours came on and was like dude i haven't had this much fun on a product since like the early days of facebook i'm obsessed with this thing and he was asking us like are you going to use it are you going to claim your account so if you missed that episode let me just give you the like 10 seconds of what this is uh imagine you know if if like robin hood and twitter had a baby so it's basically a stock market for people so you go on the app bigcloud.com and you just see all these people and you can buy instead of just following them or just liking their content you can actually buy into their stock essentially you can buy their crater coins and so you could buy their coins and every time you buy the price goes up and every time you sell the price goes down and so it's kind of like a stock market for people's reputations and um and so when we did the pod my my coin was about 1500 at the time while we were recording it and ryan was like my fourth biggest holder he had bought up a bunch and he was like are you gonna use this thing or not i said sure i'll give it a try and i'll see what happens of course dude yeah you know like there's guys who take like like my friend jack takes every vitamin if you're like hey i have this vitamin boom done take it right like he takes every vitamin or he takes every type of supplement you could ever you are like that with bitcoin or any type of like this isn't bad but like schemes so it's like hey there's this thing called the big cloud okay hang on yep i just uploaded hundreds of thousands of the hundreds of thousands and i'm in that is you you you tried everything i learned i learned from you well i don't think it's all the best but i do at the beginning you know at the beginning it makes sense to be optimistic when everybody else is uh you know pessimistic or skeptical uh you're like you fall to this is the greatest thing i've ever seen that's your default no no my default is i'm game to try it and then if it starts to have some merit i'm like okay you know what's really cool about this x y and z even if a b and c but that's not how people perceive it i had people message me after our thing saying like why the hell is sean uh pumping this big club thing it's a ponzi scheme and i was like i don't know he likes it that's just right that's his opinion he likes it but they were mad at they were mad at me because we were promoting this and i was like i don't know so let me explain so we have two friends so you have one of your best buddies is jack smith um and jack he came on the podcast we did an episode with him back when this was an interview show and i asked him i said well how did you create this bungle thing that now sold for i know 750 million dollars or something like that and the root of his thing was i try every platform early as soon as something comes out i want to try it and in fact yes if you go on big cloud jack smith owns two cents of my my coin oh he was there before me of course he was right on product he became the number one power user as soon as product hunt came out he used it every single day with nfts and collectibles um he's like the number one power user on all these different platforms for digital for for for fractional ownership and collective yeah on uh rally road he's the number one buyer exactly and um and so that's what jack does and it's not that all of these will work it's that you only need one to work for it to pay off big right if you were early in twitter uh you know even just as a user you would have a big following if you were early as an investor in any of these companies if they hit it gets very big so that was the first kind of huh i noticed that from jack then i saw then i was talking to my friend fer khan he's the cto and was co-founder of my previous company probably the best kind of technology guy i know and furcon's always dabbling so he was the one telling me about bitcoin and ethereum before anybody else before and i didn't listen to him i didn't buy and he was just buying like he put like five grand into ethereum in the ico or something like that you know like and so you know the ico of ethereum was 17 cents and now it sells now every ether is is uh 1700 right so you can see the type of appreciation you get when one of these hits and he's had you know for every one that one ether that hits big like that he has you know maybe 50 or 100 things that don't fully pan out like for example he's huge on vr he bought me an oculus i was like dude let's play vr poker together let's try vr and like vr hasn't hit in a big way yet and he spent you know thousands of dollars on vr he spent you know hundreds of hours building in vr and so far that's yielded nothing but i asked him what's what's your deal with this is it because you like am i dumb i don't think vr is big you you seem to be all over he goes no what i do is anytime there's an interesting technology i'm just curious about it and therefore i'm liking the first 10 000 people that really understand every new technology and he's like because of that one of those technologies is going to be big so right now for example he's super into vertical farming and like hydroponic farming and he's just like all about indoor farming all about vertical farming and like so he's we have this one hour a week called the cool [ __ ] hour where i just sit back on zoom and he just kind of shows me the cool [ __ ] he's been trying out this week and this week was all about vertical farming and it blew my mind i didn't know anything about it and he was telling me all the reasons it's awesome why is this just not an episode that we do it should it really should be because it's so good it's kind of my edge right now because he tells me about [ __ ] and then i go take action on it and like he's even earlier than me so he gets more upside but i'm still very early just by being buddies with this guy so anyway that's a long way of saying it in technology it pays to be optimistic it pays to be an early adopter if you're willing to look stupid sometimes by by putting some time or money into things that fail you you will net out way way ahead just by being early into a bunch of interesting things at the very least you learn um but at the most one of these hits and then you gain a bunch of like you build a big network there or you make a bunch of money because you invested in it so anyways that's that's my overall philosophy i totally see the people who are like bitcloud is dumb this is a scam this is a sham this is you know this will never work hey i think there's merits to all those arguments but from my opinion i just thought this sounds interesting sounds very different than anything else that's out there i tried it and i immediately liked it so the first 24 hours i was hooked by the second 24 hours i had put a hundred thousand dollars into the platform you know don't tell my wife so right now my um you is a that's a lot of money that's a lot of dollars it's a lot of money yeah so let me tell you why it is a little bigger thing right now my thing is uh my market cap on here is it goes 170 to 200 000 i sold some of my stuff and a guy wired or um sent me money on coinbase uh ten thousand dollars right [Laughter] i'm like i think this is silly but like i told you this is silly and you're still gonna give me money okay fine i'll take it i sold some of mine yeah you sold some errors i have not sold any of mine uh and instead i actually invested money into the platform or bought a bunch of people's coins including yours and so um so i own a bunch of coins for all these different people that i think might appreciate and so i would say there is still a i would say in the long run this working in the long run i think there's like a less than two percent chance this works in the long run if it does work my hundred thousand dollars is going to be worth tens of millions of dollars but that's the that's the long run um two percent case okay well i wouldn't put up a hundred grand for a two percent win because i actually have a second way to win in this case which is that i have now been an early adopter of basically every crypto thing over the last i don't know five six years and some of them are dumb some of them work whatever and what i've seen is that anytime a kind of new exciting disruptive idea comes out whether it's icos or nfts or whatever pick your favorite acronym there's like a hype cycle that takes place there's the people who are there's the people who make it that's the people who buy in at the beginning and get get access and then there's like a bunch of crypto enthusiasts who are believers in the general like innovation space of crypto that then say oh cool this sounds fun i want to go try it and that's happening right now with nfts like we talked about our friend jack who's selling a bunch of nfts for you know hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars it's because there are crypto enthusiasts who say nfts are really cool i want to invest in that the crypto enthusiasts are not many of them hate big clout uh yeah sure some many many if there's crypto enthusiast is not one group of people it's broken up into like what's called bitcoin maximum list they don't want to talk about anything except for bitcoin and they don't want to they they want to invest 100 into bitcoin then there's ethereum people who are like all about ethereum then there's people who are just just trying to degenerately gamble across all the different like different crypto projects that exist i'm talking about more about them the gamblers because i understand the game more money have you made more money off bitcoin than you have selling your company no that'd be cool if you did it would have been sweet i think in the long run i will but uh as of now no but you know if you project forward five years i would almost certainly my crypto holdings will be worth more than what i sold the company for when i got out of the sale do you think that what percentage of your net worth do you have a crypto so i i tweeted out that i was moving 25 into of my net worth into bitco into bitcoin and not just like not just liquid net worth just net worth i ended up getting about 20 in but the price kept rising as i was doing it um so my my overall my average buy price is about eleven thousand dollars per bitcoin um but anyways my my holdings now are like i don't know almost fifty percent of my net worth just because crypto has appreciated so i didn't put in as much as i said i was going to it was a little bit less but it appreciated so now it makes up more and i didn't sell i didn't like sell to rebalance let's put it that way that's crazy so anyways the thing i want to tell you about is so that's my general my my let's let's play out three scenarios scenario one uh let's say with big clout this is a a scam i don't believe it's a scam given that they have backers and investors like andres and horowitz and sequoia chamoth coin you know coinbase capital the winklevoss like basically like everybody who's legit in the technology slash crypto space like these are tier one names that are invested in this thing i don't think it's a scam it's definitely not a scam in the sense of that's like it's malicious people right so that's that's like one one thing that does happen in the crypto world people take your money and they [ __ ] run away right that is literally that has literally happened so i don't think it's that um and i'll bucket in you know one of the big criticisms is you can't withdraw your money yeah you have a huge amount of value in there but you can't withdraw yet i would bucket that into the scam argument like if you think they'll never allow you to withdraw i think that's silly that would be a scam then after that podcast i kind of understood what the heck big clout was which is it's basically a social network where you can bet on the people who are gonna you know and their reputation and so as a as a as a participant you could say okay instead of just following sam if i think sam is awesome and sam's going to only get more popular over time i can actually invest in sam which is a little bit different than like patreon or sub stack where it's like i'll pay you for your [ __ ] that's different that's like okay do i want to buy this content or not instead this is i'm a believer in you and so like back to that thousand true fans concept it's like if i'm a believer in you i can invest in you and as more people realize that you're the [ __ ] um your price will continue to go up and i will actually i'll go up with you my my stock and you will appreciate so i can actually make money being a curator being somebody who um who recognizes talent before others do who recognizes reputations that are on the rise so i think that's really cool that's a new thing you couldn't do that before if i was an early user of snapchat or like twitter or facebook or whatever it was cool but like i didn't actually gain anything from it financially if i discovered jack you know you said you met jack when jack had a kind of smaller following you didn't gain financially from jack's following growing and so i think that's a new thing that that that's a really cool mechanic now on the other side let's say you're let's say you're the creator let's say you're jack you can basically go on and say cool you know what um i'm like a little mini warren buffett i want to have my berkshire hathaway summit my my shareholder meeting so you can basically say cool for my top 25 coin holders um i will meet with you personally and you know in a zoom or in person somewhere um and that's a privilege you get by being one of my top shareholders or i can say hey i'm gonna produce some premium content and instead of having to set up a whole different app like substance or patreon or or something else like you just say great if you own over 10 of my coin you get this thing um and so it gives people a way to not just buy the content but to be a long-term holder of you and i think that's really cool too as a creator and so so you're in your market cap right now it's like six hundred thousand dollars how did it did it get that high because you bought your own stuff or i've only bought net one coin of mine um so why are people buying you or how are they even hearing it i heard about it on the pod i think so i think that was one thing but then otherwise there's just people hearing about big cloud because a whole bunch of people join right like so even just in our little network right um andrew wilkinson joined two days ago and you know he's a super legit person and he tweeted out today i woke up at five in the morning thinking about big clouds and he's like you know and not just all good things right he said like the design kind of sucks i kind of hate the name i wish it didn't feel so shady because the way they're doing this this and this but here's some things that like the mind virus has infected him where it's like wait this does open up pandora's box of a whole bunch of new capabilities and things that you just kind of kind of couldn't do before and definitely couldn't do in a platform that had any legs and this has legs about 170 million dollars has been deposited onto this most of that is from their institutional backers like andrews and horowitz and sequoia and those other guys um but but the rest has been you know maybe eight to ten million dollars has come in from from users who are buying into the platform uh the cto of hubspot darmesh he's on there every day me and him are chatting on there all the time because he's like he's posting like you know he's a daily user of this thing because i think it's a cool new technology cool app and he's playing with it he bought money he he bought my stuff exactly and so uh i've had a lot of fun basically speculating on people buying a bunch of people's coins and i think i think those people are awesome or undervalued so for example i'll give you an example i saw this guy on big clout and he was posting a bunch of analysis so he's like exploring the blockchain and he's he says look because this is built on the blockchain it's all public you know if i go to facebook i can't tell you how many daily active users facebook has they have to disclose that information for me to know it but with things built on the blockchain you just see it and so um so this guy's posting like look here's how many new people signed up today here's how many posts there's been and so you can see like how much engagement this thing has or if it starts to fade you'll be able to see it fade so i bought this i bought a [ __ ] ton of this guy's coin i bought ten thousand dollars of this analyst coin because this guy was super low priced because nobody knows who the heck this guy is but i knew that if if there are people who are power users of the platform they're enthusiastic about big clout they're going to love all the information the 24 7 news cycle about big cloud they're going to love this guy's analysis because it's not easy to do it's not easy to go on the blockchain and figure this stuff out so i thought oh if this guy's if this guy's gonna put reports up every day he's gonna get popular and so already i've doubled my money on this guy just because um i was able to like have a strategy have a a skilled gamble as what i'll call it right same reason i love poker same reason i like investing in startups and the stock market is because there is definitely this like deep itch scratches of like trying to put in money and triple it and make more money um combined with some skill there is a strategy to it it's not just a slot machine where you just pull the lever and you hope for the best so for for whatever reason for some combination of reasons this [ __ ] is so addictive to me and maybe this will fade i'm only three or four days in but man i've used the hell out of this thing in three or four days and i don't know what's gonna happen i've only known it for three or four days but my life this is my vocation i found it that's what i hear from you well you hear what you want to hear i didn't say that what i said was i've had an amazing three or four days and this might fade um but i view it as a kind of asymmetric bet if this one if it fails i lose one i lose one times my money if this succeeds i'm going to make more than 10 times my money and so that's why it's a good bit for me speaking of betting on people jack we were talking about you earlier basically uh sean i didn't know so basically we gave your background we said that you and celia lived in a shitty apartment a little studio five 450 square foot studio or something like that and brooke tried to make it sound like slumdog millionaire he was like he's like you know they shared one ramen noodle each and yeah jack was that right was it 400 something square feet 450. in bad neighborhood crown heights that's right yeah i mean it was it was all right um and and uh basically started an agency it was only going okay not going that great and then like over the last 18 24 months you've just knocked it out the park yada yada i didn't realize until sean said it when he said do you see what jack did it's crazy i thought he meant you selling one nft for like a hundred grand i didn't or however much you sold that like what's the difference between a jpeg and an nft thing i didn't see that you have one for 76 million dollars just put it up this morning do you think that's gonna work look at this i love it okay so jack can you tell us about the 77 million dollar one what's the thinking behind that and then just in general what's the nft experience been like it's kind of mind-blowing yeah i think um interestingly enough this text message that got me on this podcast is uh kind of uh evidence for the strategy behind the 77 million 77 million dollar nft which the thesis is um it's rounded up from the highest bid on that b pool collage so that was 69.3 and obviously tracks to the price of ethereum but anybody who would bid on this would be you know the owner of the most expensive nft in the world um so you know part press play commentary on the world of nft's artistic statement uh i have very very very you know the the idea of that selling is obviously absolutely ludicrous but the fact that you can do something like that without permission and make a statement like that i think is like that's that's the uh the intent behind the the piece itself and the nft space like the last three pieces that i've been working on the last three pieces i've launched have been sort of a commentary on the world of nft so the first one sam talked about it's like what's the difference between a jpeg and an nft i put that image on twitter and you got a great response someone commented and said you should make this an nft let's just say no more made in nft and auctioned it and then the second one uh just finished today there's like a comment on the idea of non-fungibility right so anybody can save this jpeg but what we're really talking about here is like this mimetic status game that's all these different incentives coming together to you know some people are buying these because they love them some people are buying them in the same way that they're betting on a creator like a big clout uh the same thesis behind a big clout you buy this thing and you assume this person is going to keep creating for years and maybe they emerge at the top of the space and then your investment increases in value um i think there's a lot of parallels with what you're talking about with bitcoin it's it visualize value sort of was almost a layer on top of the business i was operating so i was making these graphics to you know create things that would get people's attention to then put something else in front of them and be like hey here's this thing so like my background is marketing and advertising and that's how that works right you make stuff to get people to look at other stuff but now there's like this convergence of you can get paid directly for the things you make which is completely different right i think you know patreon what do you think the odds are that someone's gonna buy this i mean impossible to say 0.00 why no well what's happened since since you put it up this morning no are people bidding on it can you can you bid below that ass no no so you have to enter that it's all or nothing yeah yeah okay can you see any of the activity of like traffic to it twitter well that's the only place i would have data and what's your what's your people would visit a few thousand i think is this like so far and i think it's like it's also an inside joke as well right like you have to have the context of the people thing mario yep who sean i saw you saw that tweet he added this layer of context to it which is like the reason uh you know it's very minimal in its execution but when you have that additional context i think it's like there's a light bulb moment that goes off so the thing i respect is that it's all or nothing if you had done it where it's like oh well hey may not get 77 million but i'll take you know 77 000. well then it's sort of like okay he's just you know it doesn't have the same artistic balls that it takes to say no this is the if we're either breaking the record and this is the most valuable piece of digital art in the world oh we're not and it's a commentary on the whole madness of the situation it's like we're either going all mad or we're laughing about how mad this was that we're not doing anything in between i'm not this is not a this is not some you know quick sale here again another parallel with bitcloud it either goes off or it just uh you know it just stays there forever as a memory right yeah as i that's why i tweeted i said this is either going to be an amazing investment or amazing lesson learned for me and um and and i mean that because i i intentionally invested an amount of money that would hurt for me to lose it um like i would really have to like lick my wounds if i lost this amount of money because it's not going to just go down by like 10 it's going to go down by percent or it's gonna go up by like ten thousand percent and so you know either way i'm gonna learn something out of this whole process it is so polarized and clear and i had to write down why am i doing this what do i believe about this and what and part of the why i'm doing this wasn't just here's all the great reasons to do this it was like well you know i kind of sat on the sideline at this other thing that i was early on and i missed out on this big wave and a bunch of my friends made a bunch of money doing it and so i'm kind of waiting for the next one and like now that this one's here i'm kind of over over compensating for it so i was really honest with myself about what was what are the psychological drivers and and i'll put put two things together one is one is that which is like here's the dark side of why i'm doing this meaning like here's the not so great reasons but true reasons that i feel motivated to do this right my own psychology put on a piece of paper the second thing is maybe this is um you guys have probably all heard this i know jack you have for sure sam you know the thing about the four levels of luck no because the four levels of luck i forgot mark andreessen shared this from somebody else and then neval shared it and that's how i heard it but basically it's like there's there's dumb luck or you're just you're standing still and luck just hits you upside the head something really lucky you just have you get struck by lightning right um that's just dumb luck you did nothing and something happened then there's like the second level which is you're moving around like crazy and you're doing a bunch of [ __ ] and then doing a bunch of [ __ ] you kick up a bunch of dust you move a bunch of things around and actually you have a higher percentage chance of colliding with luck because you were taking so much action right and so that's kind of like you know um uh you know the luck favors the bold basically you took a bunch of action therefore you're more lucky than somebody who didn't then there's a third one which is luck favors the prepared mind which is you're moving but you're also looking and when you see something you recognized luck before others saw it and so i would say jack is a good example of this which is he had the artistic ability to create really compelling visuals but he also had the like business brain and like kind of tech savviness and was in the tech world enough to see nfts as this opportunity uh that he could marry his two things together and give it a try and so that's where you recognize luck for what it is and then the fourth one is reputational luck which is you have built up such a big reputation that luck finds you well that's where some in some great company says sam we would love to have you on board because we've been reading your content for years you're such an amazing copywriter and we just think you could really help us out with that you know um and so boom luck came to your doorstep and that's that's sort of the analogy that naval gave or whatever was like someone finds a sunken treasure and they come to you because you're known as the world's best scuba diver so to me this is like luck level three um and maybe a little four but three in that luck favors the prepared mind so what i realized when i i looked back at bitcoin and i said i was being told by smart friends back in 2013 2014 that bitcoin is amazing and at first i took no action that cost me you know the price was i think 70 at the time so i let it go from 70 to 700 and then i bought it at 700 and even then i bought in such a small amount that it wasn't gonna like change my life either way i wasn't gonna care if i lost i wasn't gonna be rich if i won um and i i went and i looked back and i said well why didn't i take more action at that time right let's let's do the hindsight game and one thing i realized is that in order to i i didn't bet on it because i didn't have enough conviction i didn't have enough conviction because i didn't even understand what the heck it was so part of that is i didn't take time to understand it but the second was bitcoin was one of those weird things that you had to have two totally different skill sets in order to appreciate the how great this thing is you had to be really technologically sound uh in your brain to even under even understand it and be able to go buy the thing or mind the thing it took real tech savviness to do it at that that time the second thing was you had to really understand macroeconomics and very few people had that combination and the people who did have become billionaires and have been very wealthy people now but most people who had one or the other or neither they didn't they didn't benefit right so you need to you needed to understand that wow this solved the byzantine generals problem this is a computer science breakthrough and now we can have trustless systems without any central entity but you also needed to understand that hey the government prints all this money and has this inflationary effect and the reason that you know and actually this thing that we all take for granted the u.s dollar or currency has really only been around in its current form for i don't know 70-ish years and uh and you know before that we had gold and before that we had shells and money actually does evolve over time and maybe this is the new form of money and here's why it's a more sound money than these other things i'm familiar with right so very few people had that overlap i see the same thing happening with bitcloud which is on one hand you had to understand the financial incentives that this like the token economics or crypto economics that exists here what are all the incentives and why would this thing go up and when you if you understand the crypto economics the token incentives you're like holy [ __ ] this is so well designed this is a very high likelihood of going up if it going up a lot if it becomes a thing the other side is just understanding how social networks start and um when i saw that oh this is like probably the most brilliant growth hack i've ever seen these people who whoever made this is very aggressive and very smart they're aggressive because they went and scraped twitter and they put all of our profiles on their website and said come buy their coin without anyone's permission that took a level of aggression and sort of like willing to operate in the gray that most people wouldn't really have and then the smart thing was they said well how do we make this network really valuable well if we get really valuable people on it how do we get really valuable people on it well let's do this let's go to really legit investors so big name investors that adds credibility let's go get 100 million dollars from them and then let's invest that 100 million dollars into the accounts of all the influential twitter people and so when i went to the website without ever having used the damn thing my account had 55 000 sitting in it all i had to do was tweet it out and say hey i'm using big cloud come use it with me basically right and i had to tweet that to my 120 000 followers in order to claim this 50 thousand dollars that was sitting in there this like kind of imaginary fifty thousand dollars i was sitting there and um okay so that i was like that's gonna work a lot of influencers are gonna go see a hundred thousand dollars sitting in their account and they say all i gotta do is tweet this thing out like done like sam you think the thing's [ __ ] stupid but you did it anyways because you were like [ __ ] i got 35 grand sitting in here i'll take that and jack how much money do you have sitting in your thing uh about 150 i think last time i looked at it so 150 000 maybe is sitting in your account and have you verified your account yeah or claimed it no do you plan to i'm still i don't know man i'm getting text messages and phone calls and being invited on podcasts to talk about bitcloud so maybe i gotta do it yeah maybe you do and maybe you have a pretty big [ __ ] incentive to do it which is that there's 150 grand sitting there just for just for tweeting the thing out and um and so then you so then you go like layers deep you say okay so they're gonna tweet it out they're gonna claim their money and then they have a big following so then their people are gonna say oh if jack says it i trust jack and jack is jack is using it then i should probably use this thing they go on and because there's no withdrawals right now all the prices just go up and so everybody's going to get all these paper gains and then they're all going to talk about how this is the greatest thing since sliced bread cause they're just making all this money on here right like our friend ryan who came on was like dude i'm making a killing on this thing and then other people are gonna say oh [ __ ] my friend's making a killing on this thing i should go do that too i don't want to miss the next bitcoin i already i already missed bitcoin now i'm gonna miss the next one and they're going to get on and that's going to drive the price even higher and so what i saw was that this thing was brilliantly designed from kind of like a game theory perspective now let's take let's table like the moral questions and like is this a ponzi scheme like there's a whole bunch of other questions but i at the very minimum i thought wow this game is architected so that these numbers are going to go up this is going to have a hype cycle very likely chance of having a hype cycle and if it has the hype cycle these things just like bitcoin bitcoin is only valuable because everybody believes in it now and the more people believe in it the more valuable it gets the more certain its own success becomes the same thing is true for any network any social network too the more legit people believe in it and want it to succeed um the more likely it is to succeed and so then there's actually a chance that this does become you know a new a new wave of social networks so anyways that's my whole sorry i've i've known you for uh since uh maybe eight years now it was early on when i met you that you had some type of it factor and that you were at least mildly smart what what big clout and bitcoin has done for you has basically like brought out all of your confidence and all of your speech giving abilities now the whole high iq thing and if you're right thing tbd but your ability to convince people that it's awesome very very high i congratulate you on your confidence and your ability to persuade people i think it's i think i think i think you finally have come out of your shell now all right the whole are you right thing well no we're gonna i keep saying the thing which is there's a very low chance that this succeeds in the long run if it does you're gonna get paid super handsomely very similar to bitcoin back in 2013 2014 and very similar to the hundreds of other crypto projects that had the same promise and didn't pan out right so that's the thing with low odds usually they don't pan out when they do you can get paid handsomely there's a middle ground here where if this goes through a hype cycle there is a good chance that even if it doesn't succeed in the long run in the short run there's a bunch of money to be made that is the degenerate gambler side of me and many people anybody who is in the into game stop anybody who's you know going and trading a lot of people have fun speculating and trying to uh make money and they're not necessarily trying to be long-term holders so that's situation two it's situation three is it just flops it goes to zero there are all three scenarios on the table what i'm trying to say is the probability is i'm not saying this is likely or definitely going to succeed what i'm saying is i find it super interesting from a product point of view how they made it and i think there's a good chance it goes through the hype cycle beyond that i don't know so jack um what what what does this mean to you what what side are you on i'm just sort of waiting for it to shake out i guess i think the first time it came across my feed was like the ultimate bear case like you know this has broken the the commandments of crypto therefore you should not go anywhere near it and my understanding of the like mechanics of pre-mining and all of these like i wasn't paying attention to the ico cycle when it was happening years ago so i just felt pretty um you know unqualified to make a bet on it and i think to your point sean there's like reputational risk in endorsing it too before it gets to a point of i don't know some of the things that are left unsaid or haven't been clarified are clarified so i'm on the sidelines for the time being yeah i think that's smart i think that's the risk i run which is i think that when i say hey this is a this is a gamble you can lose all your money it's not likely to succeed that there's that there could be some money to be made here's my exact holdings i feel like i'm disclosing everything and smart adults are going to do with that what they want do your own research don't rely on me and come to your own conclusions i'm telling you what i've come to thus far three days in and so i'm always like oh people will get all that in reality all anyone's gonna remember is dude you were super excited about that thing and either i look like a [ __ ] genius or i look like an idiot scam artist that's the sad part about it is that nobody's gonna remember any of the nuance around how i was thinking about it anybody just remember dude you sounded so excited you said you put 100 grand in and either you know that's why you're the hottest things to slice bread if that becomes a 10 million steak or it's gonna be i lost my life savings how could you you told me this was gonna work and uh unfortunately um the way i wish the world the way i wish people listen to it is not gonna be how people actually listen to it as my guest are you the biggest uh the biggest bit clout bull in the world sean ah not even close like craig clemons uh who's you know friend of ours been on the pod um he was on it before us he's invested i don't know how much money but he's like the biggest whale you go to anyone's account he owns he owns like the majority of their coin like he he and he's like yeah i'm bullish um like you know he could speak for himself how he's thinking about the calculated risk but like you know he's got a huge stake and i'm you know envious of how early he was on and how bullish he was early because it's already he's got a lot of paper gains let's put it that way um as far as uh and then there's of course a bunch of other people like you know there's there's the big the the the the whale guy i forgot his name is big big clout whale or something like that he put a million dollars into his own coin and he's he also has you know the biggest kind of like nft collection out there i think well that guy bit he bought um he wired me or i keep saying wired but he sent me 10 grand in ethereum so one guy is the guy who's providing secondary market liquidity that's the guy you worked with then there's this guy who basically has the whale coin it's a community token a separate thing uh he owns two million dollars worth of nft art and he created a coin that basically says hey i collect this art if you own my coin you own a part of my art collection and um and so he's made he's made it big he's made a bunch of money in crypto he reinvested into nfts now he's reinvested at least a million bucks into big cloud as well so there's a bunch of people who are very very bullish on this thing you know but um and and you know there's but i'll also say like you know what are the downsides right like a if you go use the thing you'll notice three things right away it requires a password to join that's already has blocked like 80 of people now you could find it if you just twitter bit clout if you google big cloud password you'll find it easily but today that's a that's a challenge it's password protected because they're not ready for scale which is the second part you go use the thing and it's so it's like under such heavy load all the time that like i click the follow button and the thing [ __ ] spins for 30 seconds it's like super annoying that it's not a faster app it's like the thing is always going down because they can't handle the scale right now um jack are you are you gonna make more income from nfts in 2021 than you think you will from your real job or your normal business rather probably and three letters you didn't even know last year yeah it's a different market man different dynamics very crazy would you say three years ago where were you what where were you at was it now march i was just starting my agency so i was shooting uh car commercials on the uh like for uh you know just running around the desert with a handheld camera trying to make a car commercial and isn't it crazy how much things have changed in such a short amount of time the last couple months has been like compressed uh a ton of um just leaps and bounds of technology and culture and um last year obviously shifting to doing work fully online i think was one jump and now like the normalization of crypto is just feels like another like rocket um and stuff like you know what we're talking about here is like it feels like that stuff is just not just creeping into the mainstream but it's just a burst pipe now right like the top shot thing just went absolutely bananas then this big cloud thing is going to pull on the same like cultural levels that top shop did maybe it's successful maybe it isn't but it's like the cat's not going back in the bag at this point right so jack let me ask you because i feel like i feel a little torn right because i come on the pod because i come on the pod today and i say oh i gotta talk about big clout why because a i've been using it a bunch for last couple days one of the more interesting projects i've ever seen but b i'm like kind of embarrassed to even talk about it because there's such a good chance that this thing fails that it's gonna look pretty stupid and big cloud is even more it's gonna look even more stupid when it fails than like let's say like i guess like what i'm getting at is i think that it's you know it takes a long time to build a reputation of being smart and trustworthy and it's easy to lose it in a day um you know i think warren buffett said that once and uh you know it takes it takes it a decade or whatever to build a reputation and a day to lose it and so i kind of feel that way with with bitcoin but cloud crypto in general it's all such uncertain territory it's uncharted waters uncertain territory nobody really if anybody tells you they know what's gonna happen they're definitely not saying you know tell me the truth uh people speculate people have fun talking about it people place their bets and then the chips will fall where they may now do you feel that way with nfts like do you feel almost embarrassed or slightly guilty you know selling a file for 150 000 and you know let's say next year the nft market comes down to earth like i think right now top shot is top shot's getting slaughtered um it's going down like 30 month over month because all the whales are like hey cool we've made millions of dollars let's just do a coordinated sell-off and like you know like let's sell this baby now let's take something off the table and so topshop's like cratering right now and then as it starts to crater all the people who thought it was going to fail are like see you know i told you so this was silly to begin with um as somebody who's selling digital art for hundreds of thousands of dollars does a part of you worry like what happens a year from now when you're the same nft you sold for 150 000 is worth a thousand dollars and um what do you i guess how do you think about that yeah i thought a lot about it i think um coming into it originally had zero expectation of like the level of investment that people would be willing to commit to something like this one thing i will say is i've like i have a relationship with every single person who's bought one so because the twitter layer on top really the nft layer you you often they have links to twitter profiles obviously introduce yourself everybody that bids on the work and i think that to me is you know if you have a relationship with the person that collects the art that's different than throwing it into this anonymous market and you know profiting x off it i also think there's an argument to be made for like my background is commercial advertising right so i know you guys spoke to michael saylor a couple weeks ago and i just have this like um i guess loop in my head or this thing i'm thinking about around what is a marketing expense relative to a like a uh a technology in general so if you're an ethereum like whale let's say let's say you bought x number of thousand ethereum at seven cents or whatever it was back in the day and you want to see the technology you believe in the technology that made you wealthy adopted by more people you want to like spread the gospel as it were feels to me like there's a lot of people participating in this market for that reason so the nft explained piece which was by far the most expensive um or the largest sale of the last few i've done i think they've got four million impressions on twitter so if you think about what it would cost you to buy four million impressions on twitter or if what it would cost you to develop something that has that level of resonance i think it's easy to get distracted from that as as like the three of us have distribution but that is a valuable thing right to own something that has that level of cultural uh velocity to me is you know i don't want to say it's underpriced but i think it's like i think it's a uh it's a legitimate bet like if you can see that this thing has um this thing resonates with people and that's the beauty of having twitter so visualize value you can see this image that you own 3 300 or 4 500 people clicked on and said i like this thing so there's also a mega advantage there having that layer on top where you can evaluate how like how much this thing resonates before you sell does that make sense i yeah that does make sense and jack as like i i consider us close friends i wanted to like buy i wanted to i was willing to spend around five thousand dollars to buy one of your things just because i like look up to you as like a creator and i actually think your arts badass and i think you're gonna be like a far more important person than you already are i was willing i so i get the sentiment now without sounding like a douche like i i have money right and i was real only willing to spend five grand the way the re the way that someone was gonna spend 150 grand that either they're like way richer than i am or they're just crazy that's what i like i don't understand 150k but like maybe some people don't understand that i was willing to do 5k so these are the people who bought bought it very very well sure you could like do your ethereum wallet slew thing and figure out how much people have but well you said you know that right [Laughter] like i don't have to i don't have to know someone i'm like oh well the guy drives a g wagon he's from dubai some people don't have their real name but it's like hey um you know you develop a relationship here here's how it works the guy who bought the people uh artwork for for whatever 69 million or something like that um i i i i'd be mixing it up but you know meet covan that's his has his handle uh well i just read about him he he started a uh i mean he's probably worth hundreds of millions of dollars through bitcoin so he's really invested invested five thousand dollars into bitcoin and is worth over a billion dollars based on when he invested it so he's reinvesting like i said you go to chuck e cheese you're great at skee-ball you hit the 5 000 jackpot the tickets start spitting out of this machine you don't think about it like spending 150 000 you think about it like spending 70 ether and you have 70 000 ether or whatever right so he's spending a fraction of his like giant stockpile of crypto bucks and it feels different i'm shocked there's that many people that like jack butcher which who's like a relatively he's not people but he's like kind of a big deal that there's that many people that will just buy his thing for 100 grand i'm just shocked that there's that many people who have that i'm not on your own being shocked right and if jack if you do sell this thing for 76 million dollars i mean like obvious like who cares about history and how neat that is i mean that would like that would be gener i mean that would you the butcher family would be famous for five generations i mean that would be the most absurd that'd be crazy perhaps it would be it would be just so wild and so funny i i hope it works i kind of actually in a way maybe i actually hope it doesn't work because you know what they say about people who you're not exactly this because you've worked hard for it so it'd be like selling a company for you but you know what they say about people who like win the lottery and how like a huge some of them um a huge number of them they end up becoming mathematics and or they get they're broken depressed yeah yeah like they're already messed up a little bit and now they're just even more they're they're messed up times the amount of money they earn uh like i don't want that to happen no i don't think it would happen to you i would also be nervous like you know the the fact that there's even an outside chance of it happening is this the most ludicrous thing it's supposed to be like a piece of art in itself right that nobody interacts with commentary on the space but the fact that it exists on a platform where a transaction could actually happen isn't quite like just unfathomable and that would like definitely warp your experience of the world and i i can't even fathom what something like that would be like but um yeah yeah aliens will land before that happens that's crazy okay we should wrap this i don't i i don't know where we go from here but jack thanks for coming on what a weird yeah you know we texted you like 30 minutes ago or 40 minutes ago you hopped on so i appreciate that it was fun i hope somebody buys the thing i think that would be [ __ ] amazing um i think it couldn't happen to a better guy so so i think i i think there is a um i hope i get a text that's like holy [ __ ] and if i get a text today that says holy [ __ ] from anybody i know what has gone down so i hope it happens it's hard dude growing up podcast is the hardest thing i've ever done it's easier to just sell a picture for 77 million dollars than it is to get create a top 10 business podcast i [ __ ] you not it is actually easier to do one than the other find out i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like my days off on the road let's travel never looking back

super quickly can you give the analogy of the icos because that's basically what it is because just when it's positioned this thing has been positioned so many different ways and that's partially because it's still kind of half baked and things are being worked out and and it may evolve into other things but at least as to like what it is today i thought what you said about it was so spot on in terms of what this really is at least so far yeah sure so on paper and again i i think one of the reasons that bitcloud has been so successful is because they are master marketers like i don't approve of it but it's kind of like when your kid gets in trouble and you're like i don't have a kid but like you gotta know when kids get involved with them right yeah yeah you're like oh you're in so much trouble but i get it as well like nice job buddy you know yeah i don't so i don't i don't approve of what they did but they but it's a smart growth hack the other thing is that they're positioning this product in a very smart way where the reality of what it is has been abstracted away so what this what this is on paper is they've basically done 15 000 icos without the permission of the people who are backing those coins right by scraping twitter and creating an account for the top 15 000 people they've created they've done 15 000 icos and now they're basically just trying to get people to buy into those icos and i think anybody who's thinking of getting into this either as a creator or an investor should ask themselves you know one as a creator would i create an ico for myself if the answer is no you know think twice about just cause someone did it for you doesn't mean you know all of a sudden it's a good idea yeah and then similarly like as a as a backer would i buy so-and-so's ico it starts to kind of break down because like when you think about this as betting on somebody's reputation that's one thing you're like oh okay well you know somebody like kim kardashian or tim ferriss or steph smith these are all people that i think are doing interesting work and are probably going to become more popular on this platform so if i'm early i should buy in but you have to ask yourself the real question which is like if you know if i issued an ico tomorrow would you buy it probably not but what the platform's done is aggregate thousands of icos and make it extremely easy to issue a new one which could be useful like there's there's potential there but let's not let's not mince words about what it is these are just icos that's literally all they are

all right what's up everybody i'm here with ethan and we want to talk about bitcloud everyone's talking about it already we don't talk about it because you know we don't really care if it's a scam we don't care you can put your money where you want it's a speculative bet everyone knows that um but as something that relates to money it also relates to reputation right people are putting their reputations on the line if they're on this platform in some way uh how we're thinking about it right as we read through the one pager as we do some of our own research what kind of what ways are we thinking about this what incentives are there long term um and we're just here to chat about it because it's such a such an interesting kind of viral topic and platform right now so um i guess we have the one pager up you guys can't see it but we're gonna walk through and comment on it so uh ethan you wanna give us a start yeah sure so i'll say one other thing too which is that uh the reason this call came about is because steph and i seem to have uh sort of a contrarian opinion on this thing right now and i we we don't know why like it's kind of funny we've been laughing about it back and forth we're like what are we missing here because everybody seems to be super bullish on this but i keep reading through like like steph mentioned the one pager or just looking at the numbers as well and i don't get it so uh quick caveat like neither one of us are blockchain experts but um our full-time job is to kind of like understand businesses and markets and people and stuff like that so we're going to talk about this from that perspective open to feedback i want people to kind of come in and explain to me what i'm not getting about this because so far this terrifies me like it's like this is like a let me off the rocket ship kind of thing um and we'll get into why but uh that's a quick caveat i i don't agree more i i have like alarms going off in my head when i and the more i read into this but i also feel like maybe we're missing something so let us know if we are but yeah let's jump in all right so uh the first thing for anybody who hasn't heard of it like what is bitcloud i'm going to read the i'm going to read a sentence or two out of the very beginning of the white paper that kind of explains it but then i want to go a little bit deeper and sort of pull back the curtain on why their explanation of what the platform is might be different from what the actual sort of eventual outcome of the platform is so there's a difference between what it's being marketed as and like what it really is so uh from the white paper what is bitcoin bitcloud is a new type of social network that lets you speculate on people and posts with real money and it's built from the ground up on its own custom blockchain uh so what does this basically mean what it means is that bitcloud's created a platform where people are almost like stocks so somebody like steph or me or tim ferriss or chamath or anybody else you can think of can set up an account they can basically make that thing public and allow people to buy and sell this digital coin that's based on their reputation and um steph i'm going to pause here for a second to see if there's anything else that you want to add to this but there's a couple reasons why i'm like this is there's more to this than beats the eye to me and i i'm i'm curious i don't think it's quite tell us the whole story so is there anything you said something important which is it's kind of like a stock so some people i don't even think big clout is necessarily you know in their white paper i don't see anything that says we are the stock market for people i think they were very clear about that but then the natural association that people have is to be like this is the stock market for people and one thing that's really important there is it's not right so normally when you have a stock you have actual ownership over something and that ownership is very clear about what you get right so you get x type of voting rights or you get dividends or you also get the right to know what's happening within that company right through like public reports um and that's not true with this so even though there are certain mechanisms where it's like yes people have an asset that's based on a person so it's kind of like a stock it's not similar in that way that it functions so that's really important uh to call out for sure yeah that's a great point and there's there's something else that like grabbed my attention when i first read this there's three things in this first paragraph so i'm going to read the first paragraph uh from top to bottom so i think it's two or three sentences and then i'm just going to call out a couple of things so it says bit clout is a new type of social network that lets you speculate on people and posts with real money it's built from the ground up as its own custom blockchain its architecture is similar to bitcoin only it can support complex social network data like posts profiles follows speculation features and much more at a significantly higher throughput and scale last sentence like bitcoin bitclout is a fully open source project there's no company behind it it's just coins and code okay so three things that jump out at me from this which make me a little bit uh like less enthusiastic or i just i find myself questioning so first of all it says you can speculate on people and posts and that's really interesting i don't the speculating on people think makes sense to me because uh you know people can issue their coin and you can basically bet on whether or not you think the value of that coin is going to go up what's unclear is what do they mean by speculating on posts i don't know and i'm curious to learn more about that if anybody has any insight there but what's more important to me is this thing about the speculation features in general uh right now i think a lot of the um a lot of the excitement around bitco or bitclout is related to the values of all these creators going up so people um well for anybody who doesn't know the company basically scraped the top 15 000 twitter accounts and automatically created profiles for them um so they basically automatically issued coins for the top 15 000 creators in the world out of the gate the value of all those coins is going up right now all right and that's exciting and i think it's drawing a lot of attention and a lot of people who are kind of earlier making money what i think is a little bit unclear at this point is what they mean by these speculation features because uh the platform is unfinished so one thing that steph mentioned early on anybody who puts money in right now there's no clear path to take money out that's a feature that's probably going to come what i find myself wondering is what other features are they going to build into speculation will it be possible to short people's coins that's kind of the biggest concern that i have because if it is that opens up a series of incentive problems related to uh you're basically giving people an incentive to trash somebody else's reputation and i think to me stephanie curious to hear your take on this but that's like for me that's the biggest uh drawback related to this right now is that if those speculation features include some kind of shorting functionality then there's not just an incentive for somebody's reputation to go up there's also incentive for the reputation to go down yeah i think so there are issues with the platform as it exists today you mentioned one there's no way to take your money out currently there's also issues with you know how the platform was seated and all that was a super smart growth hack but you know parts of that were actually illegal right you like monetizing someone else's identity without their permission but let's just ignore those for the time being and say you know there's problems with the platform every platform starts half-baked it may evolve but to your point what i think people haven't really like thought far enough along with is like what what does this turn into right and of course right now it's small it's invite only to some extent um but as it evolves into something perhaps meaningful right in size in volume etc you're gonna have different kind of financial instruments created and there are all these financial instruments as it relates to companies you know most people are familiar with them with public companies but what does it mean when that turns into someone's reputation right and of course any at least in theory people uh would be opting into this as they joined the platform but i don't think people really thought about what it means to have people betting on your reputation right to your point like someone shorting your reputation someone actually creating things to manipulate the world such that you look good or bad of course some of those incentives exist today but not with the same um force i guess or the same kind of perverse incentive where there's money behind it and then you start to get into questions like okay so if i created a bitcloud coin right and i and i opted into the platform and eventually i realized well you know this isn't working for me people are shorting my coin they're talking they're making up stories about me that aren't true my own following is upset because they bought into this and my coin is going down and they no longer trust me how do i opt out that's another thing that i you know maybe they will find a mechanism where this works but i don't think people have thought into those aspects of the platform right when when you join twitter or when you join patreon or sub stack you have an agreement that's very clear as to what someone's getting and what they're not getting and you can end that contract right when once you've created a coin a big clout coin a crater coin and it's out there it's unclear how that relationship can ever end right and if it does end if there is a hard stop at some point you know someone's gonna be holding the bag right because all of a sudden that coin doesn't exist and it's just gonna be a race to trade out of it as soon as people possibly can so to your point i just don't think um i don't know if creators joining the platform have thought through what they're really opting into right and we had talked about this before ethan but you made a great point which is basically like someone opting into this is putting their reputation at risk in some way and the actual big clout platform has no um they're not really putting up any risk right it's they're basically offloading the risk onto a creator that's opting into sharing this with their audiences even past that if we just talk about like what someone gets if they buy into a crater coin um again some people i think a lot of people understand what it is today but it is not an isa it's not a stock right so you're not actually buying into um the future income or creations of that creator you are buying into their reputation which is a vague kind of amorphous thing um but that's fine there's a lot of amorphous things that people buy into and it doesn't need to be necessarily like a physical good but as you're buying into this one of the things that you mentioned before ethan is this idea that um you know you may also be able to buy or buy and sell trade uh posts and things like that i actually think that what they're getting at there is for example if someone owns a chemoth coin maybe chamoth opens up the door for anyone who owns this coin to be able to dm him or to access his his special newsletter or something like that i think there's merit to that but what doesn't bake out for me there is as soon as you start to incorporate those things i think it actually undermines this very amorphous thing that is reputation because we can all kind of vaguely say we think chamas you know his market cap at least on big club today is let's see i think it's like 40 something million dollars and you know you can be like okay that sounds right like he's he's important he he's well known um oh sorry it's 14 million dollars currently um but that's fine and you can buy into that but as soon as you start to be like hmm um he's offering dms for example as as kind of something that rewards his his coin owners the math doesn't bake out right and i think it actually again undermines the concept where all of a sudden you're like okay she wants a busy guy maybe he can he can kind of be willing to dm five people a day at the current market cap you're looking at like a single dm being worth like ten thousand dollars right and then all of a sudden i think people owning it are like okay like this is not worth the money right so i think you either have to keep it as this amorphous thing that is reputation or it basically becomes like a patreon or a sub stack where it's very clear like value for value and as soon as you start blending the two i think you actually just confuse people and undermine the original concept for sure this is one of the things that i am also a little bit confused on and so look we could talk about it through the perspective of of an example so sean curry who's am i saying his last name right is it pure i think it's curry i'm not sure john the co-host of the my first million podcast really successful guy he's put a lot of effort into building his reputation and you two were having an exchange on twitter yesterday which is really interesting so far sean's pretty bullish on this thing and um i think i understand his his take he has a couple of uh points that he made and he says something along the lines of like okay well here's why this is cool it's because as a creator i get to monetize my reputation building so it's not just it's i'm not just monetizing at the end it's like if i'm becoming more and more popular my personal value is growing along the way and i i think if i had to guess why people are bullish on this now i think a lot of them are kind of thinking the same thing it's this appears to be a win for creators because you're no longer building your reputation for free somehow monetizing that what confuses me though or or what i would push back on is is the idea that um there's two things to your point a lot of the features that are mentioned in this white paper are things that actually already exist and point number two is in my opinion this platform increases your risk and exposure as a creator so i think it actually like i don't think the value it creates is worth the risk to your reputation especially given that there are other ways to capture this this value elsewhere so i'll give you a quick example i'm just going to run through it um continuing through the white paper what the authors have said is like okay what are creator coins useful for there's a few things one they say the stakeholder meeting so you could like you said uh you could basically meet directly with people who hold your coin okay that's a cool idea uh a new way to prioritize messages so you could rather than having like this huge inbox that's just overflowing with people you could say just show me the messages from people who like own 10 or more of my coins or something like that you can prioritize based on ownership that's interesting sponsored posts premium content paid likes okay i get it these are all legitimate ideas but here's the thing you can already do all this on other platforms right like i already have a way to do a stakeholder meeting through something like patreon to your point or sponsored posts so it says right here creators have an inbox where anyone can bid to have them repost a particular post so if you want kim kardashian to retweet your fashion brand you submit an entry to her inbox and if she retweets it she keeps your money great but that's already happening like that already happens they've streamlined it a little bit here but here's the big question they've at what cost have they streamlined it the cost is the whole world can now gamble on your reputation and i don't know that long-term creators are going to see the extra value in that when they could just be doing this you know through other avenues last thing i'll say about this too the last thing they say one of the features is money likes so likes can be reimagined as purchases of the creator's coin so it costs money to like something i get that like technically speaking that's a feature that could be implemented but i i think my personal opinion that i think people are overestimating followers willingness to pay to like content like there's a reason facebook and twitter are free it's not that they haven't thought of monetizing those like buttons it's that i i just sincerely don't think most followers would do that so legitimate uses for this and i can see why people are excited about it but i have to question long term whether or not the audience engagement is there and and whether creators will really find value in this given the trade-offs uh and the risk that you face just to comment on that so there to your point a lot of these features exist in other places and people could argue oh well as you kind of aggregate them into one platform that's really interesting but i actually to what i was saying earlier i think that actually undermines aspects of it right so if you're just trading on reputation and you don't have any sort of direct relationship of like i give you x and you pay y then again this amorphous thing i don't i don't personally want to participate because we've talked about some of the like negative long-term consequences of people actually betting on your reputation but as soon as you start to introduce stuff that's more like something like sub stack or patreon where people again it's like a trade of a very clear value um the economics no longer makes sense because of the bonding curve that exists within bitcloud right so there's only going to be a certain number of people if people aren't familiar within bitcloud every time additional bitcloud is purchased it's done at an at a higher price right and there's going to be uh just a limit to which people are going to be willing to spend on your newsletter right or like to get a dm from you right and so it just like that actual relationship may sound interesting at first because you're like it you incorporate scarcity and you actually reward early early people who buy into you but it starts to degrade really really quickly um for something like this right so i don't think people have thought about that and then the other part is again i think big cloud has some really interesting ideas and if you were to take it and adjust it in certain ways and they'll talk about this it may make sense but the part that i think people are missing is like you have marketplaces for certain things like companies because of course companies die but companies tend to last for quite some time and even within like as a creator myself i can create something like a book that will outlast me and can actually have a shelf life for a very long time if you look at history in you know any sort of sense people's reputations are fragile and um short-lived quite frankly and and that's without these kind of extended incentives to actually manipulate that right and so it's very rare even top celebrities you know maybe their shelf life is is a couple decades but most of them it's you know a couple years max and then creators themselves again like you think about who your favorite creator is today it's probably not the same creator as a year ago or three years ago and so betting on people people's reputations is a little maybe silly is not the right word but i think of it as like betting on a stock that you know will almost certainly go to zero within the next couple years right yeah totally i think this is a really important point that isn't for whatever reason isn't being discussed widely enough like let's let's assume for a second that eventually there's a there's the ability to short these coins right now i don't think it's possible uh and it may be that the platform doesn't intend to build that ability at all but even if the platform doesn't people like if if there is incentive to create a monetary instrument like that someone will create it right yeah i agree with you there so if we assume for a second that that is the case then let's look at like statistically what's the smartest play for an investor what's more likely that somebody's reputation is going to continue to go up forever or that they will eventually be canceled especially in today's yeah i mean it's it's i feel like it's in inevitable for large people with large followings to eventually be cancelled exactly and which means that under you know if we assume that uh some sort of shorting instrument becomes possible then the smart money in my opinion is to bet against everybody like the smart money is on is actually against most reputations these days so uh it's kind of like when you think about it so the stock market over time is is expected to continuously go up right if you're talking about like an index like the s p um and that's why in general you you want to bet on stocks and not against them but to your point this is almost like the alternative right like the opposite where the the trend line of what most people not all people will tend to go to zero right um in terms of their reputation so to your point it's like actually betting on this maybe the same way that getting or shorting a stock can provide you some short-term return um and you can be speculative and when in the long term if you're betting on these things you're probably gonna lose right and if you look at like just the way that options work the the potential upside on shorting could be significantly higher than even owning your stock in the first place and i just think this becomes much more complicated when you introduce large financial incentives for tanking somebody's reputation so that aside i want to dig into something that you also mentioned uh which is the like the actual math on how these coins values change over time because here's so i mentioned before one thing that i understand is the the enthusiasm that this could somehow fund a creator's career right because you're being in this space i know how hard it is to make money from an audience and uh also just like really care about creators want to see them succeed so i get i get the enthusiasm for sure um for anybody creating like i'm sorry continuing through the white paper one of the things that they talk about is the creator coin supply curve so the value of these coins doesn't actually change based on perceived value of the creator it's not a direct correlation right the value of the coins goes up and down based on the supply alone when somebody buys your coin new coins are minted and the price of the coins goes up and when they sell your coins those coins are destroyed the price of the coins goes down uh what that means is that there's a very predictable price for uh the coin depending on how much has been minted you can literally tell me what somebody's market cap is today and i can tell you exactly how many coins are in circulation for them it has it has which means two things one this isn't really based on reputation it's based on i guess supply um and two it means that you can actually do some math related to how many of these coins you have to sell in order to make a certain amount of money so i want to talk about two situations in particular one is uh what it takes to make about a hundred grand on this as a creator now there are different ways to do this uh there are some things that are interesting about this platform so one is that as a creator you have the ability to set a percentage of the supply that you automatically get and what happens then is like you can set it i think it's you can set it at anything but they suggest 10 what means what that means is of all the coins that are purchased 10 percent go straight to you so if somebody comes and buys 100 coins you automatically get 10 of them and uh that's one way to do this the other way is to set it to zero zero percent and then buy a bunch of your own coin yourself uh so that just that your own value in your holdings goes up as other people buy two important things or one important thing to know about this is that and for whatever reason this isn't widely discussed creators they they only get uh paid on net coin sales what that means is that if i come and buy a hundred coins and then sell 100 coins you actually don't get any if you have your even you know if you have your creator percentage set to anything right uh there has to be a net purchase of your coins in order for you to be paid what's unclear inside the white paper is whether or not that changes or well two things it's unclear what time frame they're calculating that net purchase based on right so this is maybe it's hourly maybe it's daily maybe it's monthly maybe it's yearly i don't know it's it's not stated but what that means is like you know let's say it's let's say it's daily there could be tons of trade volume on you across the course of a day and you don't benefit at all if it's if it's net zero if it's monthly or longer then again you're not really benefiting from this as a creator if if it ends up being net zero so there needs to be some clarity around how quickly that percentage is actually calculated for the creator in order for me to believe that this is a benefit to creators themselves rather than just the people behind the platform here's the thing that's uh i think is interesting so if you let's say you set your percentage to ten percent all right based on the economics of the coin if you want to make a hundred thousand dollars then that means you have to have 132 coins sold uh at that point your coin would be worth about seven thousand six hundred dollars and uh people would have pumped about 339 000 into your stock as a as a creator so here are a couple of things that i think are interesting i agree that that is exciting on the surface right that you could make a hundred grand from people speculating on that but i think there's a question here which is if you can get people to spend 339 000 on you do are you capitalizing at the highest possible rate and is there a better way for you to capture more of that directly from your supporters than to allow them without risking your reputation yeah then to allow them to bet on you exactly that's what i'm thinking of right now yeah i think a couple thoughts there is just you're right that right now in in being able to reap the rewards of being a creator on the platform you need to basically you need to push someone to buy your coin which is what their incredible growth hack right you've got to give them kudos such a great growth hack of preceding the platform although partially illegal what they did we should say um partially legal but incredible growth hack but that is basically what's happening right that's what's pushing people to the platform but just remember there's these incentive structures where as a creator think about like as a creator today ask yourself the question like would i shall would i sell my uh supporters a shitty product right and some creators are cool with that and there's mlm schemes and all that stuff but most creators would be like no i care about how my audience views me because i have a long-term relationship with them that i hope to keep right and as soon as you start pumping them into this reputation scheme and you no longer have control right because i have control when i say hey steph smith audience i want to sell a book and i and i've created it and i understand what's in it and i think it's valuable right as soon as you start trading on this reputation mechanism and especially if you're the one pushing people to actually buy into this then if it crashes which again we talked about reputation life cycles are short so it's not guaranteed but it's i would say likely then you have in some way probably sold your audience to this what i would call potentially a shitty product right people may view this differently but that's kind of how i'm thinking about it as a creator where i want to only push my audience to buy things or to monetize them in some way but i'm proud of what they're getting from it right and of course people can say speculators can speculate whatever right but there is there is something really important here that um it's different if big clout is pushing people to buy crater coins versus if they're now kind of offloading that task which is again their genius growth hack onto other people to do this for them right um and i don't think or maybe they are and they're okay with it but i what i would just encourage if you're a creator listening to this is like if if you're creating coin and pumping it to your audience that is what you are doing um you may think it's actually a good investment and if they're early they can make money off okay cool but just know that you are selling something to your audience right and that's why where i think this does differentiate between something like a twitter right and something where there's actual financial incentives for sure and and the interesting to me like the interesting thing about what you're saying is that this isn't just your audience these are your biggest fans these are the people who are literally willing to put their money on your reputation the ones you you have to take care of the most right so it's it's this very complicated scenario where the people who you're supposed to protect the most are the ones who stand to lose the most if an outside force takes an interest in your stock price and this is not there's not just not a lot you can do to control it so it's a very complicated situation now let's talk about this super quickly can you give the analogy of the icos because that's basically what it is because just when it's positioned this thing has been positioned so many different ways and that's partially because it's still kind of half baked and things are being worked out and and it may evolve into other things but at least as to like what it is today i thought what you said about it was so spot-on in terms of what this really is at least so far yeah sure so on paper and again i i think one of the reasons that bitclout has been so successful is because they are master marketers like i don't approve of it but it's kind of like when your kid gets in trouble and you're like i don't have a kid but like you gotta know when kids get involved without them right yeah yeah you're like oh you're in so much trouble but i get it as well like nice job buddy you know yeah i don't so i don't i don't approve of what they did but they but it's a smart growth hack the other thing is that they're positioning this product in a very smart way where the reality of what it is has been abstracted away so what this what this is on paper is they've basically done 15 000 icos without the permission of the people who are backing those coins right by scraping twitter and creating an account for the top 15 000 people they've created they've done 15 000 icos and now they're basically just trying to get people to buy into those icos and i think anybody who's thinking of getting into this either as a creator or an investor which should ask themselves you know one as a creator would i create an ico for myself if the answer is no you know think twice about just because someone did it for you doesn't mean you know all of a sudden it's a good idea yeah and then similarly like as a as a backer would i buy so-and-so's ico it starts to kind of break down because like when you think about this is betting on somebody's reputation that's one thing you're like oh okay well you know somebody like kim kardashian or tim ferriss or steph smith these are all people that i think are doing interesting work and are probably going to become more popular on this platform so if i'm early i should buy in but you have to ask yourself the real question which is like if you know if i issued an ico tomorrow would you buy it probably not but what the platform's done is aggregate thousands of icos and make it extremely easy to issue a new one which could be useful like there's there's potential there but let's not let's not mince words about what it is these are just icos that's literally all they are so um i think that's an interesting way of looking at it one other thing that's really important related to what i was talking about earlier is like how you actually capture value from this as a creator so in the example that i gave um you know if you wanted to say build a hundred thousand dollars in value you'd have to have roughly 132 of your coins sold at that rate again the the the value of each coin would be about 7 600 bucks now what happens when you want to take your money out so he and again this is an example that sean gave and i think it's a good one this is like he said um and i'm paraphrasing let's say i want to take a year off and just work on you know creating or take some time off something like that i can cash out of my ico or my coin and uh go do that right okay so if you've gotten yourself to the point we have a hundred thousand dollars in this in value in order to get any money from that you now have to sell you just sell your coins if your coin is trading at seven seven thousand six hundred bucks which it will be that's a concrete number you can't change it um oh actually no i'm sorry i'm wrong these figures are based on the current cost of bit clout so if bitcloud goes up your coin could be trading it considerably more but current cost um you would have to sell a hundred thousand dollars worth of your coin at seven thousand bucks a pop you're talking about selling around 10 or 12 coins which would be most of your holdings as a creator what the curious thing about this is is that with only 130 coins issued if you then sell 10 or 12 of them you're destroying roughly 10 of the uh stock and the value of your ice of your coin will go down by 10 so here's where this becomes a dangerous thing i think is if this actually takes off it's like a legitimate way to gauge somebody's reputation what happens when you want to pull your value out and all of a sudden the market sees your reputation go down by 10 percent maybe nothing happens maybe people buy in maybe people start looking more trying to figure out why your reputation is tanking and they start finding reasons i don't know but it just doesn't seem like uh it seems like something that creators should at least be thinking about right because there are better ways to make a hundred thousand dollars at least there's other ways to make a hundred thousand dollars yeah there was a tweet in response to some of the conversation that was happening and um this guy john basically said the bonding curve encourages creators to pump and dump their own reputation i know creators who have bought up their own big clout cheap and then dumped it on later investors horrific incentive structure right so again it's this idea we're like sure you can you can make money off of this right there there's endless ways especially if you're early to make money off of this but just remember that even though this seems like an easy way to make money anything where you make money there there is a cost right and in this case part of that cost is your reputation if it's your own coin right and i'm not just talking about the like philosophical reputation but people if you pumped to buy your coin who did it and put their real money into this and you end up selling because you want to net that profit they lose money one quick question though i had is in the same way that there's and this is like a genuine question i don't know the answer in the same way there's a bonding curve where the more um the more demand there is and people buying the coin the price of the coin goes up as you sell the price of the coin goes down right um yep okay and is it also that same exponential relationship where well the reason i'm asking because you said if you sell 10 of the coins wouldn't it actually go down more than 10 in value it would go down exponentially the same way that it went up exponentially yeah so this is this is something that's a little bit unclear i can tell you what they say in the white paper so give me one second to find this okay so it says uh buying creates coins well and while buying creates coins while pushing the price up and locking money into the profile while selling destroys coins while pushing the price down and unlocking money from the profile okay this means this means a couple of things first of all and again this is something that's kind of unclear based on the way this is written how much value do you get to hold on to as a creator if let's say you have your your your percentage set to 10 if people sell your coin does that money disappear from your account i think it yes no it does so that's what i'm saying you own a certain number of coins and what i'm trying to get at is this just as quickly as a coin goes up in value from what i understand about the way this bonding curve works it goes down in value right so if you sell a coin at seven thousand the next coin you're selling isn't at seven thousand and if you said sell ten percent of the coins that ten percent is actually going to reduce the price of coins by more than ten percent i don't i can't do the math on that in my head but it's going to be a lot more than ten percent you're yeah you're absolutely right so i've got i've got the chart here and the uh just to give you the idea so if you're at 132 coins which is about like based on today's prices where you need to be to make 100 grand as a creator your coin would be selling for 7 600 if you then sell 13 of those in order to capture your money right that would bring you down to 119 coins and it would be going for 6 hundred so that's a difference of fourteen hundred bucks which is about twenty percent right exactly yeah so i mean one of the things that this kind of makes me think of is just sure it's great to be early to a platform this is not investment advice obviously if people want to speculate go speculate i don't have a problem with that it's more so just be aware of i guess the difference between is this platform providing value to people and therefore they're engaging or is it set up in a way that where they've just done some excellent growth hacks they have excellent kind of incentive structures to get people to want to participate um like which one of those is happening and really i mean it may be some combination of the two but just remember like right now the the door is closed you can't exit so the price is only going to go up right now right people know this but that's something really important to keep in mind in addition you have all these people who they've incentivized by preceding their accounts who are now sharing it with the platform but it's early days right so you don't have the the kind of negative stories that i think will come right everyone right now is making money everyone right now um has people who are excited and they're cr their their audience is excited because they've told them about this thing and more people are rushing in and you know at least for now they're making money and again i think there's totally an argument to the fact that you can make money off of this platform today and there's there's a reason to speculate on it potentially but just keep in mind that the structure that it is today is is just it's only going to go up today so that's why people are excited that's why people are telling other people about it of course these short the short term is very clear to me in terms of what will happen but really what we've been talking about is like you know what happens when those stories start coming coming out and some creator you know just told their their audience to buy this thing and they're left holding the bag how does that creator look right how does it look once a creator decides to exit the platform we finally see what that that looks like as an example we were talking about this earlier but i was actually one of the people that was not part of the original 15k but someone decided so outside of the 15k you can just create an account and someone i guess impersonated me right they took my stepsmith io handle they put my picture in the same bio for my twitter um and i was like how can this be and it's because anyone can just create an account today so that's something that they'll probably fix but i emailed them and you know to their credit big clout actually took it down i will say they took it down without verifying who the hell i was right so so someone could have just done that to another person's account as well but there was not much but thousands of dollars worth of big cloud at least in theory within this this coin what happened to it right we haven't even seen what happens to um these systems because we were only in this like exciting growth stage of like because it's literally geared where it can only grow right there's no backdoor there's there's nothing that can happen today that would be negative but as soon as those things start to happen i just i i guess we're just encouraging people to think past this early growth stage and think about where does this platform actually extend to because it's not as simple as as like what it seems to be today for sure yeah i think there's a very um lopsided view of what this actually is in in large part because of what you're talking the gearing and also in in small part because of the the network effects of the way it was launched like a lot of the people who are on this platform know each other they're all friends and the only people who have access right now are like friends and super fans right so it's all just kind of a party everyone's having a lot of fun with it what happens everyone's happy when they're making money until they aren't right yeah exactly and the other interesting thing is that this is okay it's worth it's worth discussing this by the way we don't want to turn this into like a hate fest so after totally we want to get into some of the the legitimate uses and like where we what we would need to see in order to be more bullish on this um but it's worth pointing out too to anybody who's a creator this is not this is not geared towards your happiness like we there's a so there's already an example of um of this playing out once once you open yourself up to be better on by the world the only incentive is for people to make money they they they may like some may buy your coin in order to support you to show support uh but major players and i guess i'll say that's certainly not the incentive for everyone the major incentive is to make money regardless of whether or not you are happy and so we saw kind of a funny version of this play out recently where ryan beagleman was on the um the my first million podcast ryan's a friend of the show he's a really interesting guy he's built some successful media companies and he was early to bit clout and so he was the one who was kind of brought on as like one of the one of the experts on this to talk about it and while he was on there like so ryan and sean are bullish sam was a little late to the party and he was kind of he was asking questions and he wasn't really sold on it um and ryan was kind of trying to stir the pot a little bit like he was he was trying to get sam to uh take on austin from the uh morning brew and see who could get their value to be higher again just friendly competition ryan's friends with both sam and austin and he's invested in both those guys so not a big deal but the question is like first of all sam said something which was small but i think important which is like he just said i don't want to do that he's like i've made my money man like i don't want to take on this competition now and like like you know he's got no reason to compete with austin over reputation but everybody who invests in those stocks has incentive for them to do that right so in this case it was a it was like an example of friends just kind of bantering but what happens all of a sudden when larger money moves in and and has the exact same incentives they they don't they are not set up to care about your happiness the same way that your friends are and right now the whole platform is mostly friends uh and fans so i think that's extremely lopsided and is creating a different image of this thing than will ultimately play out to be um just gonna quickly add on this idea that like right now the platform is benefiting from people with large audiences and to your point these people have money right if anything the thing that they um want to retain is their reputation and how they're viewed in the world right because they already have enough money to last them their lifetime um and i think what we're going to see quite frankly is that as some of the negative aspects of this platform potentially emerge these people are going to be like i don't i don't need this right like i've got what i need and why am i putting my reputation on the line where people can or have these incentives to um or additional incentives i should say because there are incentives already on certain other platforms but additional more concrete incentives to take someone down i just or manipulate their reputation both positively or negatively they're just like i don't i don't need this right and these people already pay tons of money to be seen positively in in different ways whether it's like buying art or wearing certain things or being on certain shows or hanging around with peop certain people and i think they're just gonna be like this doesn't make sense for me and that is big cloud's ability to um at least today grow and i think that's actually going to reverse at some point when people start to say i don't want this anymore for sure it's like their their genius is also their downfall in that they they they conscripted 15 000 of the most influential people in the world in the beginning it's like you you could not have a better marketing team out there right but you also couldn't have a worse enemy and as soon as as if like you said if hypothetically people find that this just isn't worth the upside then i think they're going to start encouraging their audiences to take to get off the platform and that could spell at the end for this now it's possible that that's all it needs like like you and i mentioned there are some legitimate use cases for this and maybe all it needs is a little bit of time to develop the more legitimate sides and you know in five years from now like we won't be talking about big clout as a betting platform but the underlying infrastructure which is more important we'll still be around if that's the case great but i think it's a different conversation than whether or not this really is the future of reputation management and by the way i mean to your point managing your reputation is hard enough without like incentives for other people to manipulate it so i don't i don't i just don't see why people who can make you know significantly more money on their own will continue to do this but i could be wrong i mean here's the other thing we're ready to be wrong here um and and this is certainly not like a black or white this is absolutely gonna happen it's more so us being like have people thought of this right and maybe they have and maybe they're just like we're cool with this or or i actually think that's probably unlikely to happen or whatever but i do think there's a portion of people who haven't thought through like what incentives exist or will exist given this structure and how will that evolve over time i just really think to your point like their excellent marketing is also just not going to work over time right and it's actually going to reverse in some way where the people who grew the platform are just going to be they're so important or i shouldn't say important so wealthy and and have reputations already they're gonna say i don't want this i don't i don't want to risk this or add these additional incentives when i don't need to so let me ask you a question then because uh i think it's important to be or we both think it's important to be balanced here we we've talked about this a lot we're like how are we going to make this not just like a hate fest on bitcloud because we have some legitimate ideas here okay so i have a question which is what would you need to see in order to believe the opposite like what would you need to see in order to reverse your current opinion on the platform and think that it's actually a benefit long term yeah it's a great question and totally agree with you if people are listening i i think in most cases you want excuse me a platform to succeed right any sort of innovation tends to be good i just think if you think about it like a spectrum where anything that you create is gonna at least at first be half baked but on one side of the spectrum you're talking about like putting up like a gif online which is just for fun who cares if it's half big it's not hurting anyone and then maybe on the other end you've got like a vaccine or something like that we're just like this cannot be half baked right if you're injecting this into someone this matters do not mess it up and then this isn't somewhere in between right and the reason that i think it skews more towards um getting this right is because people's reputations are all they have right i mean of course you have assets and stuff but um this is the only thing that will carry with me from the day i'm born until the day i die is my reputation everything else comes and goes relationships people assets um and that matters my reputation matters in terms of my ability to build an audience to be wealthy to be happy right all of us you know whether you want to deny it or not like the way that people perceive us matters to some extent and then on top of that you're laying on not just reputation but money right so anything that relates to people's finances and investing also needs to be a little less half-faked right a little more baked so to your point i think there are ways that if bitcloud could evolve and be less half-baked in certain areas there's something here although i don't think it looks quite like bitcoin does today so some of the things are that i think this idea of trading on people's reputations if you're gonna do it it needs to be um well it needs to be regulated in some way and i'm not talking about like the sec or something like that but it needs to be opt-in right fully opt-in right now they're they're seating of 15 000 people incredible growth hack borderline or maybe fully illegal right um so that needs to be it can only be opt-in and you should need to be able to verify that this person is the person that they are and then on top of that there needs to be very clear outlines of what happens if this person no longer wants to participate right because i do think that's a very very likely scenario for some people at least the second is if you you could keep it as this vague amorphous thing like reputation but i think that starts to falter because again it i think it it's hard to understand what that is and maybe that's okay but what i do think makes sense is right now they have this kind of amorphous like is it reputation is it your betting on posts can you can you know creators can make like pick and choose what they get well if that's the case and the marketplace itself should be very clear about what people are getting with a certain coin right today it's nothing but if you're gonna create it then maybe certain creators have more of an isa maybe certain creators do have the ability to like you know have one-to-one conversations with their audience but then you start to get more into like again things that exist like a patreon or a sub stack just that happen to be built on the blockchain um so that's important just clear terms that doesn't exist today and i think it should and then the third is just transparent marketing right and so i think most people have caught on to this idea at this point that bitcloud is not or i should say crater coins are not really equivalent to a stock but that is important because if people are buying in and thinking that they're getting anything in return for buying into this creator other than just speculating on their reputation then i don't think that's right and again in certain circumstances you saw um certain things like this happen at the beginning of twitter right um where they appreciated platforms or people were pretending to be other people but again when you're talking about people's reputations and then on top of that people's finances i just think it it's got to be more clear right you can't have people saying this is a stock market for creators when it's when that's confusing right and misleading for people in understanding what they're actually buying for sure i totally agree if you were if you were to ask me like what would it take for me to be pro bitcloud fully agree it's gotta be opt-in absolutely has to be opt-in if you want to participate in this by all means i would never stop somebody it seems crazy but like hey you do you you know if this if this seems like a fun way or exactly that's fine but it's got to be opt-in and it's got to be controlled like right now everybody has like everybody if you are making your money online or if you have an online presence at all which is you know most of the world at this point you now have to protect against this because it's not opt-in it is opt-out can we just talk about that real quick before you go on with my case in that scenario when i tweeted about you know someone impersonating me or whatever you want to call it um certain people were saying you know steph like you should just create your own big clout so that you just let your audience know hey this is me not this one i don't want to do that like i shouldn't have to and again if people want to participate go participate like this is not a conversation about like what people should or shouldn't do but if i personally as a creator don't want to participate my course of action shouldn't just be okay go you have to participate to block other people from impersonating you right for sure i i was thinking about this yesterday i actually think there's a really big opportunity here for some crypto law firm to get involved because at this point and again i'm i'm nobody i like i'm just i have a tiny tiny audience just kind of starting down this trail but i wouldn't want to have to think about this and i think there's an opportunity where law firms or talent agencies could basically i don't know if it would be an issue a token or what but charge to to do reputation management on this and basically police these platforms to make sure that your your identity is not being used on them i think there's a huge opportunity there even if uh you know big clout eventually pivots unfortunately i think this is the kind of genie that can't just be put back into the bottle there are whole blockchain is open source meaning even if they change it it wouldn't take much for somebody else to spin up something similar so we now live in a world where it's possible to spin up a betting platform based on people's appear like appearance and reputation you can't just undo that so there is some kind of opportunity here for law firms to get involved uh which i thought i'd call out and then to your point like this shouldn't be something that people have to opt into in order to protect themselves from so that would be one major thing opt-in i like your idea of transparency and then related to this i think this rolls up into transparency but the founders have got to have some skin in the game so like this here's the thing that's one of the things that's crazy to me this platform was built by a pseudonymous founder so you know people say that they know the person behind it maybe they do maybe they don't but at the end of the day the person who built this has no potential downside for their own reputation on this platform and like one of the things that's kind of funny i told you about this yesterday stuff but i'll just tell everybody listening like people are already tweeting there's this tweet from um uh michael arrington who is the founder of techcrunch he basically said you know psa bitcloud is not there's a there's a twitter account that's now trolling bitcloud so there's a twitter account that's not associated with the company that's insinuating that they're associated with the company and is about to make money off of like issuing coins and stuff and early users of big cloud are trying to kind of protect against this and getting a dose of you know their own medicine i don't know if arlington arrington is is involved as an investor in bitcloud but it was just funny to me to hear like bitclout is now facing a situation where a pseudonymous user is insinuating that they are like involved in their company and they're making money off of it it's like yeah it sucks it's a terrible way to launch a business so yeah i totally agree i mean here's the thing i feel like people listening and even i created a document where i walked through some some of these concepts and some people you know or at least one person commented something along the lines of like the fact that i don't understand crypto or the blockchain or whatever one i think you know we may not be experts but we've done a little bit of diligence to understand it at least at a base level but separate from that this isn't even just a conversation about crypto right like crypto obviously or the blockchain rather underlies this platform and of course there are elements that are very similar to other financial assets but like i can say candidly like i'm invested in in cryptocurrency and i i actually buy into aspects of that being the future but not all crypto just like not all parts of any innovation are not good and in this case when you actually are when crypto is decentralized right um and that makes sense when you're talking about some some entity just like money right but when you are talking about people's reputations that should not be decentralized because i am centralized i am a person that that is impacted by this platform and therefore as a person if i want to take myself off the platform or to take legal action or to do something there are reasons that certain things should be decentralized and certain things should be centralized to some extent right and in this case when you are actually dealing with people's reputations when you may even be breaking some laws by preceding a platform um you have to be responsible right there this is always this fine line between centralization decentralization or something being um you know anonymous or not is that anonymity has a lot of uh good behind it in certain cases but the kind of counter to that is always like okay well there where does the accountability lie if something is anonymous and as soon as you go into this again this realm where you're dealing with other people's lives that are not anonymous there's got to be an entity that is responsible for that and so i agree that again like i just i something that maybe bothers me is just people look at crypto or anything on a blockchain as very similar and that the mechanisms should always apply and that's where i disagree um and and i think that in this case that there should be like you said something that people can look to to be responsible the same way that twitter is responsible for fake accounts the same way that all these other platforms are responsible for the things happening on their platform this should also be true totally agree so tell me this long term what do what do you think the outcome is here i have no idea i think we should quickly comment on the fact that if people don't know already there is a lot of money going into big cloud and not just from the from the like uh retail investor perspective but from um specific large vc funds so sequoia um i should actually look this up but i know sequoyah and dreesen i think chamoth has publicly said that he has invested and i think several other investment firms but something to keep in mind here before we get into like what we think is the future is that just because you see someone betting on this especially a venture capital firm if you understand the way venture capital works is they make tons of bets in the hopes that something becomes huge right and most people already know this but just because venture capital is investing in this that just means that they think that there is a a chance that this thing can become big and they're okay if this thing falters and they actually just like every other bet they make not specific to bit clout they expect it to fail actually right um they just expect that one of the many investments that they make the long shot happens um so that's something important to keep in mind in times of how i view this is i think you know they're gonna they're gonna add certain features that people are talking about a lot right now they're gonna add a backdoor probably especially if they're backed by these these funds um they're going to probably improve on some of their verification processes and stuff like that in terms of where i see it long term though i'm not sure because i personally do think that people are going to realize that betting on people's reputations doesn't make sense so i think what you're ultimately going to see i think is the evolution of this into something very similar to one of the platforms that exists today if they really focus on the social aspect it'll end up being a twitter clone if they really focus on this like transfer of value between creators and in their their audience it's gonna be more like a sub stack or patreon if they focus more on this what i actually think is a more interesting concept is this idea of being able to um to sell part of your future earnings and really like incentivize your audience behind you that's more like an isa right and you see like if you've heard of like what's it called i think it's called big league advance i think they talked about in my first million that's where you know this is already happening in other industries this is for for athletes where they basically give away part of their future earnings to a company that that's on them early on so this stuff already exists but really what i think is that you're going to see bitcloud pivot in some way after they make their initial feature adjustments and it's going to look like something that already exists today and it may succeed and and in that case like you mentioned earlier that's a different discussion right so we're not necessarily saying big clout forever will be terrible um or even that it's terrible today but just the long-term view of its current trajectory has some very serious questions that's a great way of putting it yeah and to piggyback on something you mentioned with the investment i think there's um two things worth calling out for anybody who hasn't looked closely at this yet and again i i'll fully admit i may be misinterpreting things here so if i'm doing the math wrong or something like that shout us out and like we're i would i would also give one more disclaimer which is like we're both in media i am more than willing to bring on the founder of this and let them speak their full uh piece if they want to right somebody's willing to come forward and discuss some of these potential questions by all means i'm not this is not meant to be a takedown this is just some of the things that are like occurring to me and if there's legitimate plans in place to curb them then we want to hear about it so that's the case in in terms of the initial investment there are some things that are worth calling out so as you mentioned vcs are getting into this like one question that steph and i both asked many times is what are we missing right there's so many smart people who are investing in this there's no way they haven't thought of these potential downsides there's just no way okay so one thing to know obviously what you said there a lot of these people are just taking a lot of bets also financially speaking if you look at the way the value of bitcloud scales you'd kind of have to be insane as a vc not to get involved in this so here's the deal if you read the the one pager the the value of the bitcloud currency the the base currency on which this entire model is built it doubles with every million coins that are sold um if you do the math again i might be doing this wrong but according to this tracker that like tracks the size of the website right now there's about 172 million dollars worth of uh money that's tied up in creator accounts okay so that means it's 172 million us dollars that people have so far actually used to buy creator coins if you divide that the current cost of bitcoin is 149 bucks so if that 172 represents all of the money that's currently on the platform that means there's about a million of these big coins that has been created 1.1 million um so long story short there's a million coins i couldn't even be wrong maybe maybe that's only 50 of the value let's say i'm 50 wrong and there's two million coins the value of this coin goes up it doubles every time another million coins is sold and the company says in their white paper that they're expecting about 10 to 19 million coins to be created first of all it's a pretty big gap but let's say it just goes to 10 right if you do if you run the math out on this i feel like i'm talking about a lot of numbers here but um if if it goes up to 10 million coins and there's currently say 2 million in existence that means there's going to be seven more doublings of the value of a bit clout coin which could be huge potential upside for anybody who invested early money your money will literally double seven times i hate to say that because it sounds like it's not investment advice all right okay now let's look at why the vc firms may have gotten involved right maybe they really believe in this but if you do the math out there were two million coins that were set aside uh pre-pre-launched for the founders and the investors which uh is a potential value of 534 billion dollars by the time 10 million of these coins have been issued you know what stuff maybe i should just share my screen real fast talk do you think i should share my screen talk through this real quick or no is this making no i think it made sense i think the main takeaway is the idea that so typically when you get into something early especially as an investor you see the upside of that platform in terms of like how many people like the revenue that it's doing and in here just in the way that the the bitcoin is structured it's like you because of the scarcity getting in early matters even more right and that's why you see people rushing to it not just investors but just this idea of if i get an early not only is this like i'm not calling it a ponzi scheme but you know in a typical ponzi scheme you benefit from someone else under you doing what you're doing and then selling it to more people this is like that or has similar mechanisms where not only do you benefit from other people you know who come after you but because of this the way that the coin is structured and how it doubles um and and similar with crater coins your upside is even more lucrative right and that's what i think you're getting at is this idea where it's not even judging anyone for doing this but just as you get into anything ask the question why is someone else sharing this right is it because like if i share a link to an article it's probably because i read the article and was like this is so great i think i want you to share in the value and maybe there's an element of that where someone is saying this is so great i invested early i also want you to invest early to share in this upside but there's an element to this where if i share an article with you there's no upside for me other than maybe like feeling good about myself right and this there's very clear upside of someone who got in early whether it's an investor or someone who just happened to create their own coin or someone who happened to invest in another coin like we talked about ryan beagleman investing in sam in in austin so that's really important just always ask yourself what are what are the incentives of someone sharing this and here i think that you know we talked about the growth hack and these incentives and this platform in the way that they like they set this up to grow they literally they designed it for growth so it was so intelligent but then it does make me question you know typically when you see a platform grow it's because people are getting value from the platform and what it provides and in this case in the way that the incentives are structured it really does make me question um you know is it is it really just because people have been incentivized in this way it's just something to be aware of right sure yeah yeah so these these you know two million coins were set aside in the beginning for these investors at this point right now today if they can pull that money back out based on the price of bitcoin right now that's worth 300 million bucks and if it continues to grow up to the 10 million coins that they expect to issue the uh you know the value of 2 million coins will be somewhere in the nature of 534 billion so that's tremendous potential upside uh the other thing that comes to mind too when i think about early investors getting into this i don't know if this is the case but it strikes me that the way they launch this is extremely dubious right so it's possible that the investors bought in in order to protect themselves because like this is another thing that can happen right because the value of the coin scales in a certain way if you understand how the value of the coin scales you can set up a blockade against character assassination by just buying enough of your own coin to drive the prices up so that most people can't buy it you could buy like a pretty significant chunk of your own coin if you have the resources and uh would it would just drive the price up so high that you would own the vast majority of the coins that will ever be issued for you these mega firms maybe that's what they did who knows i don't know if if they really believe in the idea or if they did it as like a potential protection against you know future downside that just happens to come with enormous potential upset that i i don't judge it like when you look at the potential cash out of this i don't judge anybody that did it because it makes perfect sense turning a few million bucks into billions and billions of dollars is literally why they exist so that makes a lot of sense but it's worth remembering that you know saying that every major investment firm is involved in this is kind of like saying that every major influencer is involved in this the company didn't give anybody a chance to opt out so it's worth questioning that initial assessment as well um long term in terms of what i think is going to happen here's what i think is going to happen uh similar to what you're saying i i i actually don't think this platform will disappear forever i think the people behind it and the like the incentives are too strong this is a genie that got out uh i do think that we're overvaluing uh people's willingness to interact with creators and so i don't i i don't necessarily think that's gonna be a long-term feature i think we're also overestimating the willingness of creators to stay on the platform so here's what i think is going to happen i think all the prices are going to continue to run up for the next couple of months while people get involved then at some point they're going to stabilize and at the same time ostensibly the company is creating a way for people to get their money out right once two things happen i think you're gonna start to see people migrate back off this and it's the platform's gonna have to pivot in order to continue to survive if people can get their money out i think it's gonna be a mass migration off as like you said um creators are just forced to deal with the downside of this right but also once that upshot stabilizes and like this becomes more like a typical stock ticker where you're not really increasing your holdings on a regular basis oh and you're potentially even decreasing them i think the upside is small enough and the downside is big enough that you're going to see people migrate back off the platform and bitcloud's got some time to pivot between now and then they're going to have to in order to survive but five years from now i don't think we're gonna be talking about a stock market for people um i i think there's something else related to that the last thing i'll say and this is the last sentence or the second to last sentence in the white paper is um let's see what does it say here in the same way that you can move bitcoin from one wallet to another bitcloud makes it so that you can move your clout in the form of your followers posts creator coin balances etc anywhere as well um thus in some sense bitcloud is decentralizing social media much the same way bitcoin decentralized the financial system if anybody is involved from these major vc's that genuinely believes in this idea i think this is probably why they did it i don't i don't think most like rigorous thinkers look at the idea of trading on people's reputations as like a good concept but this idea of being able to move your clout from place to place may not be great but it's better than what we've got in terms of social media today character assassination all that kind of stuff this is an important feature it's something that needs to be developed and it's possible that this whole bit clout betting scheme is just what was needed in order to kind of get the more important thing into the world so in five years if it still exists i think that will be the form that it takes decentralized social media will be much more popular but the idea of betting on reputation like a lot of people are going to get hurt in the meantime i think in terms of the financial incentives here yeah i would just i think i totally agree with that i think this idea of decentralized social media has merit i think the problem today is again there are some great ideas here and if implemented uh clearly i would say is is the important part right transparently where people know what they're getting there's some real merit here that just doesn't exist today and the problem again when you're when you're dealing with people's money is that today big clout has a little trouble iterating in the way that something like twitter would because twitter can just you know there's no if they launch a feature and it doesn't work they launch another one but there's so much baked in money already baked into this the way that big clout runs today and it's gonna be hard to pivot it as i was saying i do actually think there's there's merit to this idea where you can have your own coin and there's benefits that people have but again it's very similar to something like a patreon or a sub stack and the market caps for these people or i would should say that the largest ones just don't make sense right relative to if you were actually to pivot to something more like a sub stack or a patreon so i just think it's interesting to see how big cloud has launched and it's gonna be interesting to see how they maybe pivot or maybe don't pivot but if they need to pivot what happens to the existing coins and what are they worth and you know i just think that is gonna be interesting to watch for sure but i guess the the thesis there's a train um the thesis i think that we were trying to get at in this conversation which hopefully came across is not that like big cloud is is binary bad or good or anything like that but if you're going to participate whether you're a creator yourself and you want to you know create your own coin or you want to speculate do what you want to do right obviously this is not financial advice there's no judgment here but think through past today and what what it exists as and what this may look like and if you really want to participate in that or not even from an ethical perspective but like where where do you see this going as an investment because it's not so clear-cut as it is today when the system is literally structured so that things can only go up absolutely all right enjoy uh i guess we'll leave you with one piece of advice that i always say is just never invest in something you don't fully understand so do your diligence even if this sounds like something similar like a stock market for people do your diligence to understand what it is and where you think it's going to go i like that a lot and then the the last thing that comes to mind for me with this is uh i think it's charlie munger and warren buffett are both big on this concept of how trust is your really only long-term asset and if people think more about that they'll they will make different decisions i think than if you only focus on the financial upside so get out there good luck i don't know let us know where we're wrong we'll hear from you you know where to find us all right see ya

Sam Parr (@TheSamParr) and Shaan Puri (@ShaanVP) are joined by Ryan Begelman (@RyanBegelman) to discuss all things angel investing. The guys give their takes on angel investing: how much to make an angel investment, why angel invest, and how to get the best deals.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
well i spent what uh spent the better part of yesterday trying to teach my mom and my sister how to create coinbase accounts transfer answer bit by bitcoin transfer bitcoin uh sean do you think that angel investing like is this gonna be what's the future of sean pury i mean do you think that this is gonna be your full-time job angel investing is a way to for me it's like just dipping a net into a stream of flowing water with a bunch of fish inside i'm not taking a boat out spending you know an afternoon out in the water fishing and trying to catch something is this in front of my house there's this stream with fish going through and if i just put a net in i can catch some great fish that's what angel investing is for me and that's what it's been basically for the last i don't know six seven years where my own friends my own personal network or things that come inbound through getting more popular on twitter and podcast it leads you to some opportunities people want you in their deals and you get to see deals early and before i used to sit on the sideline i watched a bunch of those companies get big and then i started you know i asked a rich friend hey if i give you a good deal that you invest in can i get a piece of the carry i said yeah that's how i got into lambda school which is already kind of like a big winner and then as soon as i did that i was like man instead of a big like instead of getting a piece of this guy's carry why can't i just do this myself so as i got a little more money i started doing it myself and then with the rolling fund that just lets me do it on steroids where i can just do more and so what percentage of your net worth well could let's be you cannot answer this but let's just say that you invest four million dollars a year in eight years how much income do you think you're gonna do you think you're gonna make an additional two hundred dollars do you think you're gonna make 200 grand a year do you think you're gonna make it so do the millions so a a good fund is gonna like let's say 3x it's money over the kind of like seven to ten year period uh great will be you know five x or more and like if you're if you count if you caught an uber if you caught a coin base uh you know you're laughing your your returns are gonna be super skewed just by this one company that's now worth tens of billions but let's assume for this conversation let's assume you're only using so let's say you're the first um let's take let's take three x let's take the most cons like the most conservative version of winning right is i triple the money so over the next three years i'm gonna deploy 12 million dollars let's say i three x that money that's 36 million dollars um that gets that comes back into the fund after returning the money so uh so a total of 148 million dollars and so on the 36 that's the profit i get to keep 20 of the carry right so that's about 7 million ish is my mental math right um you know roughly seven roughly seven million dollars and that's seven million dollars over a let's call it eight eight to ten year time span it's not the biggest like that's that's why i don't go all in on it is because i can make way more money building a business in that same amount of time so if i well in seven so but that's there's a recap that's your mind how much in you say seven million that's my fault yeah that's a significant amount of money that's a million dollars a year so you're thinking this will make you a million dollars a year for seven years starting in seven years no i think it's like kind of like a lump sum that you get in seven years more like it i get nothing for for seven years and then as these companies as the as many of them die and some of them do okay then a few winners emerge eventually you reach a steady state where you keep going and you are making a millionaire yeah really what's interesting is where you scale and you start doing you know 20 million or 50 million a year 100 million a year uh and you know eventually that's why you could see yourself hiring investment professionals you could have a whole fund has any years paid out ryan yeah yeah but i i but i think there's another important point is it's not just about money it's about well-being as i'm always saying on the show like it's about like what investing has done for me is it's been a vehicle for learning and for connecting to really interesting people and for like getting to like kind of like go on these fun adventures where i'm like learning about like the latest things in crypto or the latest things in e-commerce and i'm connecting dots and then the other thing it's done is it's made my my primary businesses far more successful because i'm borrowing ideas i'm learning like oh wow look how this e-commerce company does performance marketing i've never even heard of performance marketing until and then i brought it back to a newsletter company and i'm like oh at our newsletter company we can buy facebook ads and google ads like this ecom company that i invested in called warby parker or whatever and like i'm now i'm like cross you know i'm taking you know kind of like what your show has done a really nice job but does it no does it distract you from your main job well that's that's where like that's why i think it was smart that this guy hired some people and how you know sean's hiring some people because then then you can kind of like be as you said in two places at once but no that's you just have to you just have to take the risk of hiring a hundred and fifty thousand two hundred thousand dollars well you're not you don't have to i mean i i haven't done that and i've still made a bunch of investors but but i missed a lot of investments because of that very reason because i was like hey i'm really laser focused on biz now and summit and powder mountain i'm not going to look at a deal every day i'm going to look at like a deal every like three weeks and so i'm just gonna miss a lot of stuff you know i missed like i mean i i have a one of my the ceo of my company invested 150 grand in a um in a in a crypto hedge fund and he's you know he's up to like almost six million dollars of value i don't know if i should be saying that here but you know he i missed that because i was just like i'm busy i can't look at that right now yeah that's totally true and by the way most of the time when people say like oh it's not about the money it's about the journey it's about the learning it's about the people you meet you know the kumbaya thing normally that's like you know that's the tell it's actually almost always about the money because if you took the money out they wouldn't do any of the [ __ ] this is actually one of the rare things where that's actually true because i actually was doing all these things i was meeting founders i was helping them with their businesses i was getting excited and digging into new spaces i was keeping a fantasy portfolio of like to learn like oh i'm tracking these spaces and i think these are going to be big and i want to learn about these spaces and here's some of the companies that are doing cool things and let me observe their growth tactics from the outside and try to see what's working and maybe apply that to my business i was literally doing all those things for fun before i ever put a dollar in uh you know i was subscribed to like i don't know 50 different um angelus syndicates because you didn't have to put money in but you could get the investment memo because i literally loved the learning so much and i had no plan at the time to be investing in any of those i put zero dollars in sorry to all those syndicate leads you know i was that annoying guy that was subscribed and never invested but it was because i actually genuinely actually wanted to learn and i wanted to meet these founders and so this is one of the rare occasions where when you hear that normally it's [ __ ] in this case i'm 100 on board which is everyone and like that's how i that's exactly how i think about it is this is like a my other friend described it as like it it's a great way to just blow off some entrepreneurial steam it's like you your brain if you're operating a business you all of a sudden start hearing about vertical farming and crypto and then like you know oh what the hell is you know what the hell are nfts and like you learn about all this [ __ ] and then part of you is like should i be doing that like what the [ __ ] am i doing this stupid like real estate newsletter i should be going out there building you know this ride-sharing company or whatever and so investing gives you a way to like get the high and dabble in that and have some financial upside but you don't it lets you stay focused as an entrepreneur so that's the other like like weird psychological things that comes from investing is aside from the learning aside from the good friends you make and the network you build and the learn you know the cross ideas you get you literally just get to like it's like a release and uh and then you can go back to doing your thing do you but but are you sean are you the reason i i did the syndicate thing i'm doing it with joe and we're i i bet my own money it's it's kind of like a rolling fine but it's not uh it's only deal by deal basis whereas sean you have like money that you could deploy a little more freely i didn't do the rolling fun thing because i didn't want to have customers that i have to uh appease and talk to on a regular basis because i didn't want like a job do you feel know now that you have like a job because you have a hundred people who have given you yeah no i write a once a month update uh and i like doing it anyways it's just hey here's the new companies we invested in why i would do that for my own documentation anyways what was the conviction at the time i made the investment here's what i believe here's why i believe investing in it i like having that anyways for five years from now that's an important thing for me so in this case i just publish it to my investors great um so that's the that's all the maintenance that goes into it there was a little bit again early on of like actually getting the investors on board but i took no meetings i took no phone calls i just said here's the link and because of this podcast because of my newsletter because of my own track record and the deck i made that was enough to raise the money for me and i know that that's kind of like a not everybody can do that part most people would have to go knock on a bunch of doors and really sell this thing um so that's that but the other thing you mentioned like for you if you just get busy and you just don't care about angel investing you could just not do a deal for the next six months and no sweat whereas for me i actually do need to deploy this money and so there is like a certain amount of like startup pitches i need to take every month in order to be doing great investments um and so you know i actually have to deploy this money i can't like just sit on my hands and decide i want to go go on vacation or like just go super heads down in my own business i can't like i can't do that because i've taken on a fiduciary like obligation to deploy these people's cash right what what i thought would be man i used to invest i don't know like 50k a quarter 100k a quarter max and now i have to deploy a million dollars a quarter and actually i run out within the first two months of every quarter so so it's actually not been an issue because i just my check sizes are bigger and once people know you're investing they send you deals your friends send you deals they're like hey i'm doing this this is a good deal and they're like oh wow i didn't need to like the fundamentals make sense and all is all the good there's other good co-investors there i didn't need to go find this deal it came to me and that's that's the best best thing that happens what percentage of what percentage of your liquid net worth did you allocate to before this because now with the rolling fund i'm investing rpm right other people's money i only put a small amount of my own money for the fund before this i was doing roughly 200k 250k a year was what i put in and i don't remember what that was at that time of like liquid net worth it was like kind of substantial like it was it wasn't wasn't i don't know half a percent or something it was like like that mattered to me but also if i lost that money or like i knew going in at the very least this money is locked up for a long time i can't use it to go buy a vacation over or under 15 over under 15 or 10 percent like was it more than like 10 because that's a lot i don't know i'd have to think what what i don't know how much money i made at the time because i made more money in the last couple years than i did back then so i don't know actually how much money i had then what i do remember is thinking when i very first started i thought i need about 300 000 of a bankroll to even do this to have enough of a portfolio to give myself a shot because angel investing so many of your deals are going to be losers and so i thought okay i need to have you know 20 to 30 bets i need at least 300 to 500 000 of bankroll to go do this and at that at the very beginning i didn't have that that would have been an irresponsible amount of money for me that was like at the time i don't know half of the money i had or something like that so i said okay i can't do that that's why i started talking to other people and being like hey if i scout for you can i get kerry and you put up the capital and that's how i got started [Music] i really like this as opposed to buying public equities when you have very little money because of the learning and the connections and like the benefit that that could have on your own business like i was betting a very high percentage of my money initially and it really helped me because i rather than just buying like coca-cola or walmart or some publicly traded company where i learn nothing i meet no one you know i it doesn't really help like the day-to-day of my like newsletter business or my community business or you know the the real estate business if these things were basically benefiting my ability to make money on my day job so that's why i i actually think when you're small it's actually not a terrible idea and in fact a high point i've read a tim ferriss thing a while back he wrote a long time ago before before he started investing and he was basically like i'm just going to fund my own mba like if i was going to spend 200k yeah business school i think i can learn more investing that 200k in a mix of you know public stocks and private you know startups and when i read that i was like oh absolutely like i will build a network i will build business knowledge i'll have skin in the game and actually this might become a profitable thing you know but the worst case scenario this was my rather than going to you know wichita state and like going get my mba like why would i not do this so once i read that that's how i started thinking about it was like i'm going to put 120k in that's like that's business school and let me let me just get going well so we we not only thought about that with investing but we we lost 25 000 on the first summit we held various private summits in between summits where we would lose 20 grand here 10 grand there to throw like an event and i always saw that as an investment like you're saying like in like my network or my learning and the same thing i was talking to a guy the other day about he wanted some coaching and he was like debating whether i was worth like the monthly amount and he had like 400 grand in his savings and i was like well what do you want to do what else do you want to do with the 400 grand he wanted to put it into like robin hood and buy stock and i was thinking like man if i had known about coaching or consulting or some of the things i now know about you know like trainings that you could go get online you're taking like a writing course from like you know purell online like those things are so valuable like they're so worth the like three grand here the five grand there that if you have you know a little bit of money saved i think that's so much better than trying to make like you know the index return on the stock market when at least when you don't have that much money i i think um somebody said to me you know concentrate to get rich diversify to stay rich like when you don't have much money like put your money into building yourself up building up your learning building up your network and then later when you're when you're much richer then diversify and have a you know an allocation and a portfolio like that i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back

big cloud is so addictive and so much fun and so lucrative so far on paper that i just can't i can't talk about anything my wife wants to throw me out of the house right now like so the good news here guys is that i signed up for big clout but i pretty much only signed up because ryan just called me and said uh i want to talk to you about this sign up i i don't really know what it is so you guys could talk about it and i'll be the one asking the questions on behalf of the audience right like an idiot so let's let's take a stab because it's kind of new and foreign and most almost i would say 99 of the people listen to this are not active on bitco yet um let's each take a stab at it ryan and see if we can get to a simple explanation of what the heck it is so here's my here's my simple explanation sam big clout is basically like a stock market for people so me and you and ryan and anybody else uh we each have like a little coin a price where you could buy some of our stock let's call it um and so people are going on there and they're using bitcoin to buy our stock because they believe that we're going to continue to get more popular and our reputations are going to grow and that owning a piece of our limited um coin uh the you know if i own ten percent of your your stock basically uh i feel good about that because i think in the next 10 years you're gonna be getting even more popular right so it's a way to bet on people and so that's the which we which we've talked about a lot we love this we've we've looked at humanity like what we talked about before which is like is it for income sharing is it for x is it for y is it for z right now it's literally for nothing and so the reason this is cool right now is because uh nobody knows who's behind it they're kind of like being stealthy about it people know but nobody has publicly outed who's who's behind it um i do know the name of the people behind it but i know people who know the person people i trust say they know who it is and they because i asked they they were like yo i'm buying your coin are you gonna are you gonna actually use big cloud or not i was like well i don't know is this like a scam it kind of looks scammy to me and they were like yeah i thought so too because kind of the the secretive way that they're going about it but actually i know the founders they're like legit people from the tech scene they like kind of have a reputation in our circles um and a bunch of the big name tier one vcs are involved in it now that doesn't mean it's not gonna fail it doesn't mean it's not as like maybe something unethical is gonna happen or that's gonna get hacked or who knows any any number of bad things can happen but it's not random guy and you know not nigerian prince is kind of the the main thing that that i've heard now you you guys you're forgetting a major part here which is if you go to big it's bit clout c-l-o-u-t dot com you can't actually do it you don't have a password it's all you need a password so you guys are forgetting it's inviting only right now and you have to have this you know similar to clubhouse and superhuman like you know this is one of the techniques in silicon valley now to build hype and get early adopters to want to in is to not let them in and then make it so they can only get in if they have the secret secret codes so okay right that was my my attempt what would you change about it how would you describe it differently yeah i know i think you nailed it i mean it's a social currency platform i think you put it more simply you can bet on people so like take sam so i called sam last night i'm like dude what the heck are you doing how are you not on big cloud yet you need to get on here you need to create your profile so he goes on he creates his profile i put in two thousand dollars into this at the same part on big cloud i then you know i i then watched it overnight and when i woke up this morning i had already made like five six thousand dollars what and so yeah so ryan let's walk through me and sam's coins so can you just pull up actually the site's down which which is sort of problematic besides that so so that's a that's a bit of an issue it'll come back up but it's getting hammered with traffic i think so last ice last you saw ryan what was my coin trading for and do you remember my market cap i don't i'd so it's so annoying the sights down because i was hoping to have it ready but i want to say you you were pretty legit first off i just want to say like you're you're you were trading at a at a relatively high number relative to like your fame and like your twitter handle you were which which i what i've noticed is people who are known in the crypto world disproportionately are doing well on the platform so like like i bet yesterday on chuck norris and i'm because because part of my strategy is to buy people who are trading at a cheap number relative to like the following they have on twitter or instagram and like [ __ ] norris was trading at like 200 dollars but you know he's got a huge like he's a big following he's obviously pretty famous even though he's like you know a scene celebrity but i don't get any of that you do so you can set whatever percentage you want to take of the of the coin that people invest in so the default is 10 so if i buy like a thousand dollars worth of sample i believe the way the math works is uh you'll take ten percent of that in coin and so what's cool about that is like as you become more famous as you build up a reputation and as you keep your reputation you know good in the public eye like in theory your big clout uh market cap will grow and you'll take ten percent of that now what i've seen some people do who have money like you sam is they they set their percentage down at zero instead of ten percent which is the default because they don't want to discourage people from buying their their coin and then they just buy their own coin and then they bet on themselves which is something oh my gosh as okay i saw this a few days ago and i saw oh wow some people have bought like i think somebody had bought thousand dollars worth my coin um and basically i was trading for almost two thousand dollars per coin and my my own holdings that they kind of like give you through your i don't know if it's like a founder reward or like a a ten percent vig you hit on every buy or something like that my own holdings if i claimed my account i had sixty thousand dollars worth of my coin ready for me so the the the genius of their model is this wait you had six months my own coin what i what they basically what i had gotten from the way that the site works if i if i verified my account so here's how it works this is the genius the growth hack that they have which is very very smart and so what they do is they pre-made all of our accounts they took the top 15 000 twitter accounts i think and they made profiles for all of them they made coins for all of them immediately and then they let some people in with bitcoin to go buy up whoever they wanted so people start buying coins and of course every time you buy a coin the default is a 10 if i buy 100 coins of yours 10 of those coins go to you and 90 come to me so there's like a like the brokerage fee goes to the creator themselves so what this did was you're elon musk you're naval you're you're you know on a smaller scale us um and you you go on the site and right now it basically says cool if you log in and verify that you are you you you are sean vp on twitter you get to claim your coins uh your coins are sitting there in this account so i have a 60 like last time i checked this was a few days ago but before several friends bought my coin so i might have more now but i had a 53 000 uh bounty just waiting for me all i had to do was connect it to my twitter account and tweet out hey i'm on bitcloud you know like uh come buy my coin or whatever if i did if i know i didn't do that because at the time i didn't know is this legit am i promoting a scam and so i went did some background checks i asked a few people who i knew were buying my coin i said what you know is this real or is this not like ryan you know and others and so um and so that's how simple it is so so think about that mechanism right now i have cornered the sandpark market if you look at sampara i are his biggest holder um and and i plan to buy more sandpark as soon as the site comes back guys listen it wasn't like it wasn't i can't tell you what's like the red pill blue pill phrase what's the what's the what's the pill that you take what your perception is completely changed it can't go bad okay maybe i'm just like a blue pill guy here but like it wasn't that long ago that i was so poor that i would put two pieces of pizza into one whole foods box and so i could just like only pay for one or where i would like eat half the food out of my container before i weighed it uh like it wasn't that long ago that i was that poor where i where i was stealing food from the grocery store now we're talking about sean just logging in and being like oh beep bop boop fifty thousand dollars in my account yeah does this stuff freak you out this kind of freaks me out no it does not freak me out at all i think it's awesome that i could log in and get 50 000 i think that's cool now okay here's some of the criticisms right uh and this is where sam your [ __ ] detector is about to like you know fly around the room you're about to raise your eyebrows all the way to the moon when you hear this which is that you could transfer money in and you could buy coins but there's no withdrawals right now you cannot so i could go in and verify i could claim my fifty thousand dollars what i can't do is put that in my bank account um that's a feature that conveniently is not available and not built yet now they are going to do it um the the main thing for them is that um they say oh we're building it it's not ready yet in reality my theory is basically if you allowed people to immediately come in grab 100k grab if i can come and grab 50k withdraw it out of the system it's going to kind of crash the network it's not going to like the whole system kind of fails there's this there's a theory about sort of um you know like one of the reasons bitcoin is so valuable is because the central philosophy of the religious bitcoin holders is to hold the coin uh if you're selling out of it the price drops and so what they want right now is for everybody to hold their hold coins so that the network can get big enough get enough strength and then it once it's bigger and more popular you can add liquidity and people can trade it and now and it won't just completely crash the system so do we just have so much money going around right now that we have to invest okay so here's okay so let me explain to you because i also was like what the hell is this and then i was sent the one pager and i want to actually read to you guys the one pager pdf uh this might be a little boring a pdf but honestly when i read this so i talked to ryan i don't know like 40 minutes ago on the phone before this podcast i was like yo okay we're coming on i'm excited about big cloud i heard a little bit about it but i haven't had time to look at it i just had a kid like i haven't had a chance to go in and kick the tires and he was like dude this is like the most you're right you said this right you're this is the most addictive thing since for early facebook for you the craziest thing i've i've been i'm like all my friends have been up all night like one one's in alaska heli skiing another one is in utah like we're all texting all night hey who's buying chuck norris has anyone figured out like oh i just 10xed on gwyneth paltrow like a number a number of my friends like guys who worked for me at summit who have like maybe 50 000 saved have put in like a quarter of their net worth and in the last like four or five days of five to 10x their money right like but they can't get anything out they can't get enough they get it out yet but i i contacted the founder of a pretty major um like crypto hedge fund and he assured me that they bet quite a lot on this and that he's confident that they will there will be a way out plus the founder also said that eventually there'll be an exchange you know where you could sell it um it's just the easiest thing i've seen let me give you both how do i make sampar the game style yeah yeah well first of all calling it game stock is perfect that's all right you're already memeing yourself stop yeah whatever so okay so here's the okay because when we were talking on the phone ryan i was like so you're buying my coin great what what's the reason why would you want my coin what does that do for you like i get that if i get more popular in theory my coin could get more popular but that assumes more people will want to buy it why would they want to buy it what are they getting out of this it's like well then they think you're going to get even more popular then the next person will want to buy it right so there is definitely like a greater full theory that underlies this whole thing which is that i'm buying it today because i think somebody else is going to come buy this tomorrow either because the creator i'm buying is going to get more popular or big cloud is going to get more popular in reality right now both are going to happen and um and so so i think it's actually a good bet even if you know going in that this is greater fool theory this is i'm i'm looking to pass this to the next guy and make a lot of money before the music stops so i think that's the skeptical way of looking at it now let me tell you the like why this actually might be a thing long term and i'm going to read to you from the pdf um what they say this is okay so sam i'm going to read read this to you and you just tell me paragraph by paragraph is your belief going up or down okay um where did you find this i just googled bit yeah i'll send it to you it's a white paper where are you guys getting this bro we're connected on the inside not connected enough to know who's actually doing this but connect enough to know the people who know the people um all right so big cloud is a new type of social network that lets you speculate on people and their posts with real money as built on a blockchain okay cool then it goes uh it's a fully open source project um there's no company behind it just coins and code so then it says um let me skip to the part about crater coins what are crater coins everyone has a coin every profile on the platform gets its own coin that you can buy and sell these are crater coins uh you get one you get you can have your own creator coins just by creating a profile and they already pre-created a whole bunch of profiles because you know i didn't do it but my my creator coin exists okay then i had to make mine then it says you can buy your favorite person's coin to buy someone else's to buy someone's coin you just go to their profile you click buy uh for the top 15 000 influencers on twitter it's preloaded into the platform um okay cool so now uh then it says tweet to claim your profile the owner of a profile uh can claim their profile by tweeting out their public key um this will give them full access to their account as well as the percentage of their founder rewards which is that's what i was talking about my 50k that's sitting there for me that's my founder reward for claiming my account now the genius of it is by me tweeting out like i have a big incentive to tweet this out right because i get access to my fifty thousand dollars so they're basically kind of like paying me fifty thousand dollars to tweet out about big cloud and if enough of the and the bigger you are the bigger your reward and so they're gonna get a lot of big people to tweet this thing out which is going to create this like enormous hype cycle um okay so then it says what are creator coins useful for so this is where it starts to become interesting it goes there's a new asset class that's tied to the reputation of an individual for example let's say elon musk succeeds in put being the first person to land uh land on mars put a person to mars his coin price should theoretically go up because he will be world renowned for it um and if in contrast he makes a racial slur during a press conference his coin price should go down because his reputation takes a hit his popularity uh goes down so you as a trader can make money by buying and selling the ups and downs of speculating on a person's future popularity okay so then it says state what could you use the coins for um so today it's just about buy and sell but in the future let's say that you know right now for example i think craig clemens is my biggest coin holder he has like i don't know ten fifteen thousand dollars in my coin ryan's got a right how much of my coin you got worth um i think i bought like three four thousand dollars what can i do to reward the people who own my coins so that more people want to buy my coins so one is a stakeholder meeting so you could basically say okay i'm going to do an ama or a q a for anybody who owns over you know 100 of my coins at whatever so what do you tell them like hey everyone i wanted to give you an update on the next quarter i'm thinking that i'm not going to say anything just because you're racist but i am going to do that i am going to film someone committing suicide which might make my think you're like report about your own popularity you're saying okay for my super fans who want access to me you want more access like let's say you know like for example our friend andrew wilkinson has done a thing where he says cool buy this expensive thing for charity and you get to do a lunch with me or you get to join this ama's q a exclusively with me and 25 people who pay the five grand to this all the proceeds go to charity it's that same idea if people want to do a want to ask you a question or whatever so here's a simpler version right that's like you get to attend a private meeting for people who own x amount of my coin the other way is to say look i get a bunch of spam in my inbox every day people email me people dm me and literally this is true there's so many of those that i don't respond to 90 of them and unfortunately some of the good ones just get mixed up in all the random junk that people send me so here's the thing i have an inbox the inbox is a has a contract that basically says anybody who um if you want to message me it costs you five coins um and my coin has a real price so you you you can do that by either having a huge amount of my coin or going and buying some in order to message me and i will respond to everybody who rep who sends me this paid message through this channel right so now i can have an inbox that has a price with it or i can prioritize it based on sort this by my biggest coin holders because those are my vips i want to talk to them first i want to give them replies first another another idea they have uh sponsored posts so i can have an inbox that basically says you can pay me you can you can buy a certain amount of my coin and i'll retweet your thing um and so it's just a simple like you don't need an essential middleman agency to set up like these paid promotion deals it's just i just set a price or people just bid a price and i just look at it and i say okay i'll take 100 coins 100 of my own coin for posting this thing i don't mind i actually like the thing you told me to post and then the last one like there's an only fans version of this where cool if you have this man if you pay this much coin of my coin per month you get exclusive content the last one is what they call money likes so let's say uh like let's reimagine the like button so instead of just being able to smash like on everything let's say that it costs a tiny amount of coin to like something so for me putting out a good post like let's say that clubhouse thing i did that went viral today all i got was fame i didn't make any money off the fact that seven million people saw that thing twitter made money but i didn't make any money so in this case if i put out great content that goes viral like my my clubhouse thing then every person who's hitting the like could be basically buying in order like they're buying a micro amount of my own coin and so i earn for posting good content um in that way and by the by that person buying my coin by hitting like they're actually sort of investing in in me right because they hit the like let's say it costs one sean coin to do it they bought one sean coin they hit the like button because they like my content now let's say i keep getting more popular they still own that coin so our both of us have an incentive to do that those are some of the ideas what do you think where i am right now is like it's there's one of three things happening one either my iq is just low enough that i can't keep up with you guys when you discuss this two um i'm just out of touch and like it's happening where like when my wife started getting a job at facebook her dad was like why do you need it why do they need all these people it's just a web it's just a website like am i am i getting am i getting out of touch or three um this is [ __ ] and i'm right well can i can i give you a simpler use case well right now i'm uh you know i've been doing executive coaching i think as you guys know and i've been i'm coaching the the founder and ceo of morning brew and i think we should pick austin reef and alex lieberman a morning brew against the sam at the sam par on big cloud i'm i'm going to buy coin in all of them and let's see who can become the bigger market cap in the next 30 days but i don't want to do that like i'd wouldn't it be better if i just spent time in like making money on [ __ ] that i own in the entirety of but these this is like the i thought these guys are like like your nemesis this is a newsletter war between the hustle and the morning the final i've cashed out dude i've won like i like like i i have everything i need i've i've i have i've won my game as far as i can tell austin is crushing you on big cloud in terms of his market gap right there he goes now now those competitive juices are starting to flow he's like i don't care but if you're saying he's crushing me at a game i don't care about i start to care about the game a little bit no i have the game i care about is my bank account and what time i could wake up in the morning your popul no that's not my big account what how many houses you'll be able to cash scenario one these guys never build a way to cash out this whole thing is a scam all the smart people that are involved in it are wrong cool there is a percentage chance that that is true i don't know what that percentage is might be one percent might be 50 let's just take that off the table because if that's true then yeah there's no discussion it's stupid and useless if if you're buying if you can only buy in but never sell out like you know what is this you know robin hood like you can't you can't do that so here's the the other side of it let's say it is liquid where you can trade some of your coins for actual cash if you want it or bitcoin if you want it um but people are going to be betting on hey this podcast going gonna keep getting more popular sam's gonna keep getting more popular he's gonna keep doing more things i've seen his twitter account growing he posts awesome content i want to get on on the ground ground floor of sam and they start buying your coin because they want to hold a piece of the sampar popularity like clout score basically and they believe more people are gonna buy it so now more people do start buying it and um your stock goes up your stock goes up because you sold the hustle and then this podcast hits number one on the charts and more people hear about it and then we do some viral thing and then that goes viral you get more popular there now what but shaw do you actually want this do you actually want yes people betting i'll say something i like about it is i've always kind of tried to be an early adopter of certain things right that i was excited and like naturally curious about and i would tell all my friends but i had no way of like riding the wave with the person i was popularizing i would go i'd be like yeah you really should check out this awesome musician and then they would just get really famous and like they would get way richer and in fact i often couldn't even talk to them anymore because they became too big a deal to even you know return my calls and like i would have liked to have been like on the ride with them like financially that would be really sam i met you before you started the hustle right and i was like this guy's the [ __ ] this guy's you know totally switched on he's dynamic dude okay if you could if i could have just bought stock in you and not bet on like for example i had the opportunity to invest in the hustle the media company i was like well i don't know if this is gonna be like this humongous billion dollar company or what i don't know if this fits my profile whatever i don't know about media but i was bet i was believing in you the whole time and if i could if i could have just bought sam and owned sam for 25 years that's something i want to do i think that you are going to become a hitter and you're already on your way to becoming a hitter and if i could have done that from the beginning or like you know we've talked about the founders of calm i was buddies with them early on now calm is so big that i feel guilty even hitting them up to go hang out with them because i'm like ah they just everybody wants their time they're busy with their you know huge company what am i gonna do i really wanna go hang with them now so you know i'm a fan from afar now but at the time if you said that you could buy alex too and you could buy michael actin smith you could buy their uh their their coins i would i would bet in all my friends coins right i and i do with my time but i don't ever get to benefit financially from spotting future stars today i uh that was a good speech i think that i'm a little bit uh on board now dude i feel the exact same way there's so many entrepreneurs including uh the guys at com that i met through summit early on and for whatever reason i didn't persist in getting didn't get the ability to invest in their company you know they it was mentioned i i didn't i didn't like you know i missed the email a friend of mine heard about it i wasn't at the right event when they were raising i met him three months earlier whatever now i can actually bet on these people it's it's i don't know well this is one there's two there's two huge problems is the fact that you've just put tens of thousand dollars on this website and you get you can't get the damn thing to [ __ ] turn off right now for this entire podcast this podcast has been on for 45 minutes and it's it says big big clout is under brief maintenance all funds are safe thank you for your support it's a black screen with a red text yeah i remember when facebook first came to my college and i was like we were one of the first colleges and i remember like calling it was really fun that this is the first time i felt like that in a long time that's why i wanted to come on the show and talk about it but there's two major differences which is you didn't have money on facebook and two you you knew a little bit about the background and who made it we're looking at this anonymous thing that isn't working and you have money on it that's a little nerve-wracking and also you can't even get your money back out if you want to by the way sam do you know how many of my like angel investments went to like i had no clue someone was like you should try like this guy said from this person then you should throw 50k and i was like what the least i could do could i do 10k okay cool here's 10k and you know so over i think now 25 of those or so have gone to zero but a few of them pop so i i'm looking at this like an angel investment right like i'm looking at this as like one in ten but i get it i'll do it i'll do it but i'm not gonna like i think that people like youtube need someone to criticize you because like just everything on paper that we're doing here it's just like this sounds like a horrible total scam and i think you should be optimistic about it and i'll definitely dabble in it so here's the other thing right like let's let's say you said something earlier like facebook didn't have money in it like i think you meant i think what you meant was you didn't have to put in tons of money to bed and facebook you could just start using the thing and it's kind of like you know the risk like brian just said that that his uh normal young friends had a quarter of their life savings uh you know yolo so so okay so so here's the part that i think is exciting and a lot of people have talked about this this is the first attempt that it actually clicked with me and i'm like oh this might actually work so there's a whole bunch of people that since crypto came out that were like oh my god we need to take the social networks and we need to convert them into crypto networks basically what we need is why don't like why does facebook and twitter and instagram why do they make all the money and we do all the work we make the content we like each other we put our attention and our time into viewing the content viewing the ads and um advertisers spend all the money and they don't you know they're hoping to make a return on the other side but the users who do all the work to on these user-generated content platforms reap only social value no financial value and so a whole bunch of attempts were made people tried to make steemit which was like reddit but like instead of the karma being kind of funny money it was like real money you know type of thing but never took off and uh but the the fundamental always did make sense which was if you did get on a platform early and you were one of the people that helped make it big why don't you ever get any reward for that if you were one of the first uber drivers first airbnb host first power users on instagram you know like what is it worth for those people that are on clubhouse today that are making content you know freaking 24 7 and trying to make clubhouse successful and they're they're not the investor in clubhouse it's you know andreessen horowitz and like easy and kevin hart and [ __ ] and so um so easy he's not an investor but well because he's dead one thing i love about this that you're saying is when i got into some of these you know awesome investments like uber i couldn't share them with anybody i'd call my mom and be like you really um sorry but i i can't even get you i couldn't get you in you know and now it's like i feel excited i wanted to come on the show and like share it with the listeners and like share it with trends because i was like [ __ ] everybody as soon as i get this password and as soon as the site's back up like we can all actually we're like as soon as the site works and as soon as they open it and as soon as withdrawals happen this is totally gonna be sweet but until those three primary fundamentals work this is garbage i say i was rightfully pointing out the obvious i feel like i can rule the world i travel never looking back

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
so i came on the show to talk about only two things and one of them is how is my investment strategy where after 20 years of of making like i don't know like 60 investments i've now figured out exactly how to do what you're just what you're talking about you want to hear the breakdown i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on the road let's travel never look sean all right we're live what's going on um i did something last night i had dinner with uh andrew hey hi becca and uh so the bat i gotta tell people the background of the story because it's fun uh basically shawn tweeted this thing got viewed by like probably six million people at the time he politely but he still said it that he thinks clubhouse is gonna like die it was polite whatever andrew chen who's a a friend of mine is basically discovered clubhouse i think he was their first investor he loves the company he thinks it's gonna be the biggest thing ever invested in um blocked sean invested in it black sean and uh sean po this sounds like silly drama and it is but it's fun but but it's fun uh sean blocked i didn't block him or sean got blocked and he sean you posted a a picture of it and that alone got thousands and thousands of likes so anyway i just think it's fun i'm a little caught in the middle so it sucks for me i'm not def i'm not actually defending i'm i'm actually defending both sides but i'm not i'm uh i'm staying neutral but i i think both both parties are actually right so did he block me because i think it's fine at me or why did he block me he just says that he goes i have a rule that i just don't like a lot of negativity on my twitter feed and also anyone that disrespects anyone that i'm associated with i just automatically block i don't even reply which i think is fair i actually think that's a good i'm on board with that i don't think you're disrespectful but i i it's cool that he feels that way uh yeah that's okay i i think it's fine um i was surprised because i met andrew before and we were friendly um like you know before this i would have thought andrew is somebody who um you know if i see something interesting i would send it to him i'd be like hey this i think this is right up your alley and he'd be like cool thanks man and you know we if we saw each other at a at a meet-up or a party we would say hello like you know it was it was like that so i was surprised when he blocked me him and mark andreessen blocked me so uh both of them you know followed before and then went straight to block without like you know anything in between i i'm cool with that i'm sure you guys will all be i'm sure you'll all be friends eventually you guys are all great i totally get it you know like if i respect them if i think someone's just being a hater or like you know and for them i think they get it from all angles like they're always fighting with what's her name taylor lorenz and like you know different people in the media and [ __ ] like that or they're probably just like dude i just like they're probably just tired of people who are critics uh or critical and i think there's a difference right there's one person who's a critic and this is somebody who sits on the sideline and they're a professional criticizer um and i think there's a difference between being critical which is to say hey actually like i'm trying to uh i've noticed some things or i've made some observations and here's my opinion and i don't know if i'm right or wrong i'm saying it as an opinion clearly and secondly i hope this is not true i hope they succeed and i was genuine about that that wasn't like just some [ __ ] i put in there um and i'm clearly somebody who has been through it i'm not just like somebody on the sideline throwing rocks you know like there's that thing that that quote uh that everybody loves that's like you know some teddy roosevelt quote or whatever the man in the arena you know it's not the critic who counts type of thing and i would say in this case you know i'm neither the man in the arena because i'm not doing this startup um nor am i the critic who just sits in the bleachers and you know boos you know i'm like the man who was in the arena got my ass kicked by the same competitor and i'm trying to yell to the man in the arena hey watch out this you know this this competitor is no joke and um here's why here's something if you try this move this might be a problem if you try this move this might be a problem i hope you don't try those too the issue the issue is is that your thing you're polite but criticism nonetheless reached so many people that it it you could actually impact the outcome i i i people might think i'm crazy i think that i think that tweet could potentially uh uh have a have a say i think this will have zero impact on the company uh in terms of that if anything it should have a positive impact or maybe the product people inside the company read it and they say okay you know what are the if you take the jokes and the zingers out and you just look at the actual like like the kind of the product observations what the challenges might be cool like do we think we have a good uh do we think this is true and if we do think it's true do we have any good um counter attacks for what this problem might be and how we might actually solve this problem um i think that would be the positive somebody people keep sending me these charts because the google trends in the app store keeps showing that clubhouse going down like sharply like recently and they're like oh the sean pury effect i'm like no no there's zero percent chance i could do that and if anything most people haven't even heard of clubhouse yet i haven't had access to it so if anything a bunch of drama about clubhouse should actually be driving interest up in checking it out or googling it and trying to figure out what this what is the fuss about uh if anything but you know the other thing is i get there what the thing that might have pissed them off is like okay the tweet storm was a little over the top you know maybe unnecessary but uh okay you know forgivable uh but then you know the next day i go on cnbc and do a two-minute segment about it and they're at that point you're just like who is this [ __ ] guy and why is he on this crusade against clubhouse why is he going on tv talking [ __ ] and like my only response to that is uh hey if i get invited on the cnbc i'm just going to say yes like i know that sounds a little silly or selfish but like i don't know put yourself in my shoes would you not want the opportunity to go on tv like i think that's fine and i don't think i said anything that was harsh or untrue to them so you know anyways i i could see them being annoyed i just got off the phone i just got off the phone with hubspot's pr people because we were talking about something and i was like you guys see shawn on a squawk box or whatever it's called and they were like yeah they're like he killed it and i'm like yeah it's it it made me happy that these like uptight they're not uptight but i i i pegged them in my head yeah i pegged them in my head as being such that uh they've been on board with you like you didn't do anything wrong but like you've made funny con you're talking about kim kardashian's butt and they were like it was awesome so i'm happy they're on board uh so in this episode we're gonna talk about big clout right but before we do that we have ryan beagleman he's on the line he's going to come on in a second before we do that i wanted to bring up two things with you the first thing do you remember a couple months ago when we talked about a carbon offset credit card so i have to learn exactly how this works but we discussed this of about this idea of basically taking a mastercard and just putting slightly different branding and slightly different perks and building a business a company that we uh didn't know existed just raised 250 million dollars today building an uh a carbon offset credit card called aspiration i think it's called no see that see that uh aspiration is the name yeah i just linked to it in our thing it's called the la's socially conscious bank challenger aspiration launches a carbon offset credit card they raise 250 million dollars from leonardo dicaprio orlando bloom but then they have some like actual real people like alan and co uh cool we we we uh we called that one yeah there's actually i can't oh wait a minute had they already raised i think they had already raised 100 million as well right did we miss that ten months months ago we uh our ignorance of not knowing about them also still shows that we predicted it even if it had already happened um i actually am investing in another one i'll send it to you it's stealthy right now but when we can talk about it we'll talk about it the founder started a media company actually before this uh grew it huge sold it coming back to market with a credit similar similar idea a credit card where the rewards the perks and the branding are around a different part of your lifestyle and not like you know the generic which is like cash back or travel rewards travel points you know go stay in a marriott for a fourth night free um and like what these carbon guys are doing what from what it sounds like is that for somebody who is eco-conscious you know specifically eco-conscious they would rather make their impact and have the rewards be something that is helping the environment then get that fourth night at the marriott and the this guy that i'm investing in um he's got a different one do i know i don't know if you know him personally but you know of the thing that they built before this and so you'll you'll like it so uh it's a very similar idea can i send it to you and we can we can do it and then we can talk about it when he launches it i'm in let's just do that love i'll bring to you the stuff which i brought i showed you two cameras are you gonna join i'll we'll show each other stuff and then let's just talk about it on here because i think people like that so far every time we've talked about investing people have liked it because you get to hear about a new concept we're not just saying oh that's neat we're saying like no i put money into this that's a certain level of conviction and skin in the game and then um also there's like the people who are interested on the investing side which is like cool so like how do you how do you invest what do you decide on what are the check sizes what what type of returns do you expect what type of returns do you end up getting what were your big mistakes people like that type of [ __ ] uh and i'll say i guess i can say no i put 10 grand into toucan and then we did a syndicate where we put in 150 total which i kind of shocked me i thought it was going to be like 50 000. um but i did 10 on that one of my own money yeah that's cool yeah i think that's interesting one also deciding what's your what's your basic check gonna be like i um like you decided 10k the first few angel investments i did were basically i think 25k and then i like randomly did like a 50k one and then i just felt like oh [ __ ] i like you know that 50k felt like a significant like a more significant bet than the 25k ones did to me the psychologically and so then there's like there's a math behind how do you want your portfolio structure and all that [ __ ] and then there's the psychology around you want to bet an amount of you want to be bidding an amount of money that will matter to you where you care and you'll track it and you'll do the work so not too little but also not too much where you become emotionally wrapped up in the outcome which you cannot control and is you know subject to all these different variables anyways i was going to do and actually we could bring ryan on yeah ryan cameron because he was telling me about his he was telling me about his buddy who i don't know if he wants to say his name about what his process was and and we could talk about in a second but we're going to talk about the guy who hired an analyst ryan but uh my um my uh philosophy right now with angel investing is i was gonna do uh maybe a quarter of a million to three hundred thousand dollars in the next 12 months and i was gonna do it in increments of ten to fifteen thousand dollars gotcha my oh my quick reaction to that is that that's too many deals a too small of an amount you know you'd rather do i think because because just to do that like okay let's just do the math real quick so that means you're basically saying yes to 30 deals to say yes to 30 deals let's you know about how many deals do you think you'll need to what percent hit rate do you have or acceptance rate so from a deal you see you either look at a pitch deck you meet a founder uh you take a meeting to saying yes you don't want that to be like a hundred percent you don't want it to even be 50 probably what do you think just for you just off top your head spitballing what percent of your deals do you think you'll say yes to or do you want to be saying yes to 30 okay that's a i think that's still probably fairly high but okay let's say the phone off the phone call right okay so of all phone calls people who make it to the phone call you want to do 30. right so let's just let's just totally no i'm not saying i'm not saying i want to do i'm saying that yeah but i also think i say no to most everything that i'm emailing okay so let's say let's just take the meetings part okay so that means you know for for doing 30 deals you're going to need to take you're going to need 90 at least of those one hour meetings um to to get to that hit rate and so 91 hour meetings that's 90 hours of like kind of like founder meetings and so it just ends up being a lot and then now you have 30 deals to like add value to to help to make intros for to do all those things so it ends up being a lot of maintenance and a lot of vetting for very small ownership and uh small checks but it is a good way to just see a bunch of [ __ ] so i like the strategy from that point of view what do you think ryan so i came on the show to talk about only two things and one of them is how is my investment strategy where after 20 years of of making like i don't know like 60 investments i've now figured out exactly how to do what you're just what you're talking about you want to hear the breakdown well can you first tell me the story can you tell the story of of the person you know who what what they did well let me i can i explain this theory and then i'll tell and i'll tell you how that plugs into it yeah so i think that the the filter for me is actually turned into i think there's an icky guy for investing so you know there's the icky guy concept i know you guys are both familiar with you know you choose your career based on what you love to do what you're good at doing or what there's a market need for right and at the intersection of those three things is like exactly the thing that you will you'll be best at and enjoy well my epiphany looking back on my like 60 or some odd like angel and real estate investments is that the ones that generally perform well are the ones that are at the intersection of what i'm naturally curious about where i'm well networked and where there's good fundamentals so it's a similar like icky guy right concept where and so my main my main filter for for making investments now is is this something i'm actually sincerely fascinated by i'm regularly reading about and i'm well networked in like so for example like i made some investments like you know in healthcare which i don't know [ __ ] about i'm not well networked in and yeah the fundamentals are amazing like healthcare is only growing in america if you know costs are rising whatever like but those have not been predictably looking back like those have not been as good as say my investments in coinbase warby parker like uber and like real estate investments where i was well networked i was really interested for a long time and the fundamentals were good so what do you guys make of that so i'm a framework guy i like anytime somebody has a framework or a thought process around how they do what they do the only thing i would say is that for me whenever you see something growing really fast and you see that the fundamentals actually make sense um it's very easy to get the other two to work so for example i can get really curious about something when i see something working extremely well i'm like wow what the hell is this and then i can curiosity can follow it doesn't always have to lead for me and the second thing is well networked what i found is that like the whole kind of like value-add side of investing is sort of a load of [ __ ] um you know i agree i don't whenever whenever we raise money i was like i don't want to talk to you ever again unless you're just having fun with you like we're just and that's hanging out maybe i'm just bad at it but what i see and i do the same thing by the way when i talk to founders i'm like look here's what i've done in my life uh if any of that applies to what you're doing i've been through a bunch of [ __ ] i've done a lot of these steps that you are about to do so i think i could probably help and secondly like i'm particularly good at these three things and by the way like i think your messaging sucks and i think i'm good at messaging you know yeah you know i think i can do the the pitch better than you your deck is a little bit weak i can help you with your deck those are true in reality the amount of times that gets taken up and actually has some material impact it's just so low well i i i'm not saying i'm using my network to help the investments i agree i rare i rarely help the people i invest with materially i'm saying i got in early to say because of my network yeah and i i can't get in early like i tried getting an early you know to say like uh spacex like i wasn't well networked then now i became better networked around spacex later and i ended up investing later but like there's certain areas where i have an unfair advantage to getting investments right and by the way we should introduce you so ryan uh you know you were part of summit you've been on the pod before many times i think uh built a media company sold it was one of the co-founders of summit summit series they bought them out and did crazy [ __ ] uh and i would say you know one of the more well-liked guests on the pod because has real business knowledge and also knows how to deliver it in a way that's entertaining to people so a good sense for entertainment so uh excited to have you on you have been infected by this mind virus can we just talk about it or do we need to like i feel like talking about anything like a big cloud cloud can't even enter my brain right now i honestly have canceled almost everything on my calendar because big cloud is so addictive and so much fun and so lucrative so far on paper that i just can't i can't talk about anything my wife wants to throw me out of the house right now like so the good news here guys is that i signed up for big clout but i pretty much only signed up because ryan just called me and said uh i want to talk to you about this sign up i i don't really know what it is so you guys could talk about it and i'll be the one asking the questions on behalf of the audience right like an idiot so let's take a stab because it's kind of new and foreign and most almost i would say 99 percent of the people listen to this are not active on bitcoin yet um let's each take a stab at it ryan and see if we can get to a simple explanation of what the heck it is so here's my here's my simple explanation sam big clout is basically like a stock market for people so me and you and ryan and anybody else uh we each have like a little coin a price where you could buy some of our stock let's call it um and so people are going on there and they're using bitcoin to buy our stock because they believe that we're going to continue to get more popular and our reputations are going to grow and that owning a piece of our limited um coin uh the you know if i own 10 of your your stock basically uh i feel good about that because i think in the next 10 years you're going to be getting even more popular right so it's a way to bet on people and so that's the f which we which we've talked about a lot we love this we've we've looked at humanity like what we talked about before which is like is it for income sharing is it for x is it for y is it for z right now it's literally for nothing and so the reason this is cool right now is because uh nobody knows who's behind it they're kind of like being stealthy about it people know but nobody has publicly outed who's who's behind it um i do know the name of the people behind it but i know people who know the person people i trust say they know who it is and they because i asked they were like yo i'm buying your coin are you gonna are you gonna actually use big cloud or not i was like well i don't know is this like a scam it kind of looks scammy to me and they were like yeah i thought so too because it's kind of the the secretive way that they're going about it but actually i know the founders they're like legit people from the tech scene they like kind of have a reputation in our circles um and a bunch of the big name tier one vcs are involved in it now that doesn't mean it's not going to fail it doesn't mean it's not us like maybe something unethical is going to happen or that's going to get hacked or who knows any any number of bad things can happen but it's not random guy and you know not nigerian prince is kind of the the main thing that that i've heard now you you guys you're forgetting a major part here which is if you go to big it's bit clout c-l-o-u-t dot com you can't actually do it you don't have a password it's all you need a password so you guys are forgetting it's inviting only right now and you have to have this you know similar to clubhouse and superhuman like you know this is one of the techniques in silicon valley now to build hype and get early adopters to want to in is to not let them in and then make it so they can only get in if they have the secret secret codes so okay right that was my my attempt what would you change about it how would you describe it differently yeah i know i think you nailed it i mean it's a social currency platform i think you put it more simply you can bet on people so like take sam so i called sam last night i'm like dude what the heck are you doing how are you not on big cloud yet you need to get on here you need to create your profile so he goes on he creates his profile i put in two thousand dollars into into this at the same part on big cloud i then you know i i then watched it overnight and when i woke up this morning i had already made like five six thousand dollars what and so yeah so let's walk through me and sam's coins so can you just pull up actually the site's down which which is sort of problematic so that's a that's a bit of an issue it'll come back up but it's getting hammered with traffic i think so last ice last you saw ryan what was my coin trading for and do you remember my market cap i don't i'd so it's so annoying in the sights down because i was hoping to have it ready but i want to say you you were pretty legit first off i just want to say like you're you're you're trading at a at a relatively high number relative to like your fame and like your twitter handle you were which which i what i've noticed is people who are known in the crypto world disproportionately are doing well on the platform so like like i bet yesterday on chuck norris and i'm because because part of my strategy is to buy people who are trading at a cheap number relative to like the following they have on twitter or instagram and like [ __ ] norris was trading at like 200 but you know he's got a huge like he's a big following he's obviously pretty famous even though he's like you know a scene celebrity but i don't get any of that money you do so you can set whatever percentage you want to take of the of the coin that people invest in so the default is 10 so if i buy like a thousand dollars worth of sample i believe the way the math works is uh you'll take 10 of that in coin and so what's cool about that is like as you become more famous as you build up a reputation and as you keep your reputation you know good in the public eye like in theory your big cloud uh market cap will grow and you'll take 10 of that now what i've seen some people do who have money like you sam is they they they set their percentage down at zero instead of 10 which is the default because they don't want to discourage people from buying their their coin and then they just buy their own coin and then they bet on themselves which is something oh my gosh as okay i saw this a few days ago and i saw oh wow some people have bought like i think somebody had bought ten thousand dollars worth my coin um and basically i was trading for almost two thousand dollars per coin and my my own holdings that they kind of like give you through your i don't know if it's like a founder reward or like a a ten percent vig you get on every buy or something like that my own holdings if i claimed my account i had sixty thousand dollars worth of my coin ready for me so the the the genius of their model is this wait you had six months my own coin what i what they basically what i had gotten from the the way that the site works if i if i verified my account so here's how it works this is this is the genius the growth hack that they have which is very very smart and um so what they do is they pre-made all of our accounts they took the top 15 000 twitter accounts i think and they made profiles for all of them they made coins for all of them immediately and then they let some people in with bitcoin to go buy up whoever they wanted so people start buying coins and of course every time you buy a coin the default is a ten percent if i buy a hundred coins of yours ten of those coins go to you and 90 come to me so there's like a like the brokerage fee goes to the creator themselves so what this did was you're elon musk you're naval you're you're you know on a smaller scale us um and you you go on the site and right now it basically says cool if you log in and verify that you are you you you are sean vp on twitter you get to claim your coins uh your coins are sitting there in this account so i have a 60 like last time i checked this was a few days ago but before several friends bought my coin so i might have more now but i had a 53 000 uh bounty just waiting for me all i had to do was connect it to my twitter account and tweet out hey i'm on bitcloud you know like uh come buy my coin or whatever if i did if i know i didn't do that because at the time i didn't know is this legit am i promoting a scam and so i went did some background checks i asked a few people who i knew were buying my coin i said what you know is this real or is this not like ryan you know and others and so um and so that's how simple it is so so think about that mechanism right now i have cornered the sandpark market if you look at sampara i are his biggest holder um and and i plan to buy more sandpark as soon as the site comes back guys listen it wasn't like it wasn't i can't tell you what's like the red pill blue pill phrase what's the what's the what's the pill that you take what your perception is completely changed i can't go back okay maybe i'm just like a blue pill guy here but like it wasn't that long ago that i was so poor that i would put two pieces of pizza into one whole foods box and so i could just like only pay for one or where i would like eat half the food out of my container before i weighed it uh like it wasn't that long ago that i was that poor where i where i was stealing food from the grocery store now we're talking about sean just logging in and being like oh beep bop boop fifty thousand dollars in my account yeah does this stuff freak you out this kind of freaks me out no it does not freak me out at all i think it's awesome that i could log in and get 50 000 i think that's cool now okay here's some of the criticisms right uh and this is where sam your [ __ ] detector is about to like you know fly around the room you're about to raise your eyebrows all the way to the moon when you hear this which is that you could transfer money in and you could buy coins but there's no withdrawals right now you cannot watch so i could go in and verify i could claim my fifty thousand dollars what i can't do is put that in my bank account um that's a feature that conveniently is not available and not built yet now they are going to do it um the the main thing for them is that um they say oh we're building it it's not ready yet in reality my theory is basically if you allowed people to immediately come in grab 100k grab 50. if i can come and grab 50k withdraw it out of the system it's going to kind of crash the network it's not going to like the whole system kind of fails there's this there's this theory about sort of um you know like one of the reasons bitcoin is so valuable is because the central philosophy of the religious bitcoin holders is to hold the coin uh if you're selling out of it the price drops and so what they want right now is for everybody to hold their hold coins so that the network can get big enough get enough strength and then once it's bigger and more popular you can add liquidity and people can trade it and now and it won't just completely crash the system so do we just have so much money going around right now that we have to invent okay so here's okay so let me explain to you because i also was like what the hell is this and then i was sent the one pager and i want to actually read to you guys the one pager pdf uh this might be a little boring a pdf but honestly when i read this so i talked to ryan i don't know like 40 minutes ago on the phone before this podcast i was like yo okay we're coming on i'm excited about big cloud i heard a little bit about it but i haven't had time to look at it i just had a kid like i haven't had a chance to go in and kick the tires and he was like dude this is like the most you've ride you said this right you're this is the most addictive thing since for early facebook for you craziest thing i've i've been i'm like all my friends have been up all night like one one's in alaska heli skiing another one is in utah like we're all texting all night hey who's buying chuck norris has anyone figured out like oh i just 10xed on gwyneth paltrow like a number a number of my friends like guys who worked for me at summit who have like maybe 50 000 saved have put in like a quarter of their net worth and in the last like four or five days of five to 10x their money right like but they can't get anything out they can't get enough they get it out yet but i i contacted the founder of a pretty major um like crypto hedge fund and he assured me that they bet quite a lot on this and that he's confident that they will there will be a way out plus the founder also said that eventually there'll be an exchange you know where you could sell it um it's just the easiest thing i've seen let me give you both how do i make sampar the game style yeah well first of all calling it game stock is perfect that's all right you're already memeing yourself stop yeah whatever so okay so here's the okay because when we were talking on the phone ryan i was like so you're buying my coin great what what's the reason why would you want my coin what does that do for you like i get that if i get more popular in theory my coin could get more popular but that assumes more people will want to buy it why would they want to buy it what are they getting out of this it's like well then they think you're going to get even more popular then the next person will want to buy it right so there is definitely like a greater full theory that underlies this whole thing which is that i'm buying it today because i think somebody else is going to come buy this tomorrow either because the creator i'm buying is going to get more popular or big cloud is going to get more popular in reality right now both are going to happen and um and so so i think it's actually a good bet even if you know going in that this is greater fool theory this is uh i'm i'm looking to pass this to the next guy and make a lot of money before the music stops so i think that's the skeptical way of looking at it now let me tell you the like why this actually might be a thing long term and i'm going to read to you from the pdf um what they say this is okay so sam i'm gonna read read this to you and you just tell me paragraph by paragraph is your belief going up or down okay um where did you find this i just googled bit bit cloud yeah i'll send it to you it's a white paper where are you guys getting this bro we're connected on the inside not connected enough to know who's actually doing this but connected enough to know the people who know the people um all right so big cloud is a new type of social network that lets you speculate on people and their posts with real money as built on a blockchain okay cool then it goes uh it's a fully open source project um there's no company behind it just coins and code so then it says um let me skip to the part about creator coins what are creator coins everyone has a coin every profile on the platform gets its own coin that you can buy and sell these are crater coins uh you get one you get you can have your own crater coins just by creating a profile and they already pre-created a whole bunch of profiles because you know i didn't do it but my my creative coin exists okay then i had to make mine then it says you can buy your favorite person's coin to buy someone else's to buy someone's coin you just go to their profile you click buy for the top 15 000 influencers on twitter it's preloaded into the platform um okay cool so now uh then it says tweet to claim your profile the owner of a profile can claim their profile by tweeting out their public key this will give them full access to their account as well as the percentage of their founder rewards which is that's what i was talking about my 50k that's sitting there for me that's my founder reward for claiming my account now the genius of it is by me tweeting out like i have a big incentive to tweet this out right because i get access to my fifty thousand dollars so they're basically kind of like paying me fifty thousand dollars to tweet out about big cloud and if enough of the and the bigger you are the bigger your reward and so they're gonna get a lot of big people to tweet this thing out which is going to create this like enormous hype cycle okay so then it says what are creator coins useful for so this is where it starts to become interesting it goes there's a new asset class that's tied to the reputation of an individual for example let's say elon musk succeeds in being the first person to land uh land on mars put a person to mars his coin price should theoretically go up because he will be world renowned for it um and if in contrast he makes a racial slur during a press conference his coin price should go down because his reputation takes a hit his popularity uh goes down so you as a trader can make money by buying and selling the ups and downs of speculating on a person's future popularity okay so then it says state what could you use the coins for um so today it's just about buy and sell but in the future let's say that you know right now for example i think craig clemens is my biggest coin holder he has like i don't know ten fifteen thousand dollars in my coin ryan's gotta run how much of my coin you got what um i think i bought like three four thousand dollars so what can i do to reward the people who own my coins so that more people want to buy my coins so one is a stakeholder meeting so you can basically say okay i'm gonna do an ama or a q a for anybody who owns over you know 100 of my coins at whatever so what do you tell them like hey everyone i wanted to give you an update on the next quarter i'm thinking that i'm not going to say anything just exactly racist but i am going to do that i am going to film someone committing suicide which might make me think you're not going to totally about your own popularity you're saying okay for my super fans who want access to me you want more access like let's say you know like for example our friend andrew wilkinson has done a thing where he says cool buy this expensive thing for charity and you get to do a lunch with me or you get to join this ama's q a exclusively with me and 25 people who pay the five grand to this all the proceeds go to charity it's that same idea if people want to do a want to ask you a question or whatever so here's a simpler version right that's like you get to attend a private meeting for people who own x amount of my coin the other way is to say look i get a bunch of spam in my inbox every day people email me people dm me and literally this is true there's so many of those and i don't respond to 90 of them and unfortunately some of the good ones just get mixed up in all the random junk that people send me so here's the thing i have an inbox the inbox is a has a contract that basically says anybody who um if you want to message me it costs you five coins um and my coin has a real price so you you can do that by either having a huge amount of my coin or going and buying some in order to message me and i will respond to everybody who rep who sends me this paid message through this channel right so now i can have an inbox that has a price with it or i can prioritize it based on sort this by my biggest coin holders because those are my vips i want to talk to them first i want to give them replies first another another idea they have uh sponsored posts so i can have an inbox that basically says you can pay me you can you can buy a certain amount of my coin and i'll retweet your thing um and so it's just a simple like you don't need an essential middleman agency to set up like these paid promotion deals it's just i just set a price or people just bid a price and i just look at it and i say okay i'll take 100 coins 100 of my own coin for posting this thing i don't mind i actually like the thing you told me to post and then the last one like there's an only fans version of this where cool if you have this man if you pay this much coin of my coin per month you get exclusive content the last one is what they call money likes so let's say uh like let's reimagine the like button so instead of just being able to smash like on everything let's say that it costs a tiny amount of coin to like something so for me putting out a good post like let's say that clubhouse thing i did that went viral today all i got was fame i didn't make any money off the fact that seven million people saw that thing twitter made money but i didn't make any money so in this case if i put out great content that goes viral like my my clubhouse thing then every person who's hitting the like could be basically buying in order like they're buying a micro amount of my own coin and so i earn for posting good content um in that way and by the by that person buying my coin by hitting like they're actually sort of investing in in me right because they hit the like let's say it cost one sean coin to do it they bought one sean coin they hit the like button because they like my content now let's say i keep getting more popular they still own that coin so our both of us have an incentive to do that those are some of the ideas what do you think where i am right now is like it's there's one of three things happening one either my iq is just low enough that i can't keep up with you guys when you discuss this two um i'm just out of touch and like it's happening where like when my wife started getting a job at facebook her dad was like why do you need it why do they need all these people it's just a web it's just a website like am i am i getting am i getting out of touch or three um this is [ __ ] and i'm right well can i can i give you a simpler use case so right now i'm uh you know i've been doing executive coaching i think as you guys know and i've been i'm coaching the the founder and ceo of morning brew and i think we should pick austin reef and alex lieberman a morning brew against the sam at the sam par on big cloud i'm i'm going to buy coin in all of them and let's see who can become the bigger market cap in the next 30 days but i don't want to do that like i'd wouldn't it be better if i just spent time in like making money on [ __ ] that i own in the entirety of but these this is like i thought these guys are like like your nemesis this is a newsletter war between the hustle and the morning the final i've cashed out dude i've won like i like like i i have everything i need i've i've i have i've won my game as far as i can tell austin is crushing you on big clown in terms of his market gap right there there you go now those competitive juices are starting to flow he's like i don't care but if you're saying he's crushing me at a game i don't care about i start to care about the game a little bit no i have the game i care about is my bank account and what time i could wake up in the morning that's the rest of my days your popul no that's not my big account what how many houses you'll be able to scenario one these guys never build a way to cash out this whole thing is a scam all the smart people that are involved in it are wrong cool there is a percentage chance that that is true i don't know what that percentage is might be one percent might be 50 let's just take that off the table because if that's true then yeah there's no discussion it's stupid and useless if if you're buying if you can only buy in but never sell out like you know what what is this you know robin hood like you can't you can't do that so here's the the other side of it let's say it is liquid where you can trade some of your coins for actual cash if you want it or bitcoin if you want it um but people are going to be betting on hey this podcast going to keep getting more popular sam's going to keep getting more popular he's going to keep doing more things i've seen his twitter account growing he posts awesome content i want to get on on the ground ground floor of sam and they start buying your coin because they want to hold a piece of the sampar popularity like clout score basically and they're they believe more people are gonna buy it so now more people do start buying it and um your stock goes up your stock goes up because you sold the hustle and then this podcast hits number one on the charts and more people hear about it and then we do some viral thing and then that goes viral you get more popular there now what but sean do you actually want this yeah you actually want yes people betting i'll say something i like about it is i've always kind of tried to be an early adopter of certain things right that i was excited and like naturally curious about and i would tell all my friends but i had no way of like riding the wave with the person i was popularizing i would go i'd be like yeah you really should check out this awesome musician and then they would just get really famous and like they would get way richer and in fact i often couldn't even talk to them anymore because they became too big a deal to even you know return my calls and like i would have liked to have been like on the ride with them like financially sam i met you before you started the hustle right and i was like this guy's the [ __ ] this guy's you know totally switched on he's a dynamic dude okay if you could if i could have just bought stuck in you and not bet on like for example i had the opportunity to invest in the hustle the media company i was like well i don't know if this is gonna be like this humongous billion dollar company or what i don't know if this fits my profile or whatever i don't know about media but i was but i was believing in you the whole time and if i could if i could have just bought sam and owned sam for 25 years that's something i want to do i think that you are going to become a hitter and you're already on your way to becoming a hitter and if i could have done that from the beginning or like you know we've talked about the founders of calm i was buddies with them early on now calm is so big that i feel guilty even hitting them up to go hang out with them because i'm like ah they just everybody wants their time they're busy with their you know huge company what am i gonna do i really wanna go hang with them now so you know i'm a fan from afar now but at the time if you said that you could buy alex too and you could buy michael actin smith you could buy their uh their their coins i would i would bet in all my friends coins right i and i do with my time but i don't ever get to benefit financially from spotting future stars today i uh that was a good speech i think that i'm a little bit uh on board now dude i feel the exact same way there's so many entrepreneurs including uh the guys at com that i met through summit early on and for whatever reason i didn't persist in getting didn't get the ability to invest in their company you know they it was mentioned i i didn't i didn't like you know i missed the email a friend of mine heard about it i wasn't at the right event when they were raising i met him three months earlier whatever now i can actually bet on these people it's it's i don't know well this is why there's two there's two huge problems is the fact that you've just put tens of thousand dollars on this website and you get you can't get the damn thing to [ __ ] turn off right now for this entire podcast this podcast has been on for 45 minutes and it's it says big big clout is under brief maintenance all funds are safe thank you for your support it's a black screen with a wrist yeah like aerial 14 size font yes it looks like a terrorists or kids right now i remember when facebook first came to my college and i was like we were one of the first colleges and i remember like calling it was really fun that this is the first time i felt like that in a long time that's why i wanted to come on the show and talk about it but there's two major differences which is you didn't have money on facebook and two you you knew a little bit about the background and who made it we're looking at this anonymous thing that isn't working and you have money on it that's a little nerve-wracking and also you can't even get your money back out if you want it by the way sam do you know how many of my like angel investments went to like i had no clue someone was like you should try like this guy said from this person then you should throw 50k in this thing and i was like what the least i could do could i do 10k okay cool here's 10k and you know so over i think now 25 of those or so have gone to zero but a few of them pop so i'm looking at this like an angel investment right like i'm looking at this as like one in ten but i get it i'll do it i'll do it but i'm not gonna like i think that people like youtube need someone to criticize you because like just everything on paper that we're doing here it's just like this sounds like a horrible total scam and i think you should be optimistic about it and i'll definitely dabble in it so here's the other thing right like let's let's say you said something earlier like facebook didn't have money in it like i think you met i think what you meant was you didn't have to put in tons of money to bed and facebook you could just start using the thing and it's kind of like you know the risk like brian just said that that his uh normal young friends had a quarter of their life saving so okay so so here's the part that i think is exciting and a lot of people have talked about this this is the first attempt that it actually clicked with me and i'm like oh this might actually work so there's a whole bunch of people that since crypto came out that were like oh my god we need to take the social networks and we need to convert them into crypto networks basically what we need is why don't like why does facebook and twitter and instagram why do they make all the money and we do all the work we make the content we like each other we put our attention and our time into viewing the content viewing the ads and um advertisers spend all the money and they don't you know they're hoping to make a return on the other side but the users who do all the work to on these user-generated content platforms reap only social value no financial value and so a whole bunch of attempts were made people tried to make steemit which was like reddit but like instead of the karma being kind of funny money it was like real money you know type of thing but never took off and uh but the fundamental always did make sense which was if you did get on a platform early and you were one of the people that helped make it big why don't you ever get any reward for that if you were one of the first uber drivers first airbnb host first power users on instagram you know like what is it worth for those people that are on clubhouse today that are making content you know freaking 24 7 and trying to make clubhouse successful and they're they're not the investor in clubhouse it's you know andrews horowitz and like easy and kevin hart and [ __ ] and so um so it's easy he's not an investor but well because he's dead one thing i love about this that you're saying is when i got into some of these you know awesome investments like uber i couldn't share them with anybody i'd call my mom and be like you really um sorry but i i can't even get you i couldn't get you in you know and now it's like i feel excited i wanted to come on the show and like share it with the listeners and like share it with trends because i was like [ __ ] everybody as soon as i get this password and as soon as the site's back up like we can all actually we're like as soon as the site works and as soon as they open it and as soon as withdrawals happen this is totally gonna be sweet but until those three primary fundamentals work this is garbage i say i was rightfully pointing out the obvious oh no it's very risky right now it's very early days by the way we need to talk about the investment strategy because the next thing is once you get on you become addicted and you're like what is the strategy and i have like five strategies oh yes well can we talk about your friend who can we he's talking about where are you investing strategy by the way i know i know but can we talk about this because i think this is pretty interesting i won't name names but can i say details of the story right i'm going to so you had a friend who sold a business and it was uh amongst like your everyday person massive home run um but he the amount of money that he made was not enough that you would go and do what he did and he hired two full-time people to invest his money yeah and we're talking like potentially like digit millions of dollars which again is a lot of money but not enough to like have two people on staff full-time to invest your money and that's what he did and ryan said that it ended up being a massive success even though you thought it was a stupid stupid idea and it totally worked yeah i mean the thing that blew my mind is a friend of mine made a similar amount of money to the money i made selling my media company and i i did not think i had nearly enough money to build what you know is called like a family office right like i i need at most i'll hire a wealth manager i'll pay them like a half a point of the money under management they'll invest my money in stock and whatnot and my friend instead hired two hedge fund guys and analysts and like a full like a real like associate vice president like a senior guide at like a hedge fund and is paying them like you know i don't know like a half a million collectively in salary a year which is like a very high percentage of his money and and giving them as well carried interest and upside and i at the time this was in 2016. i thought that's the craziest thing i've ever heard from the world's smallest family office and what what he now he what was smart is he had a very good like kind of similar to us he had he had a good network and he didn't have time to underwrite all the deals that would come down he didn't have time to run a financial model or call people and dig you know kick the tires and make sure that you know the thing was real and that was a good investment but he had a lot of flow like we do and so i don't have time to look at most of my investments because i don't have an analyst and i don't have the time myself because i put my own time into my business right so i thought what was crazy is he did that and he's up like a lot like i don't know exactly how much but like let's just say his his big cloud investments are like 100 x marks you know so so you um what is the typical size of a family office what amount of wealth does an individual need to where you oh you typically they'll be 50 million themselves 100 it's definitely in like the i think at 50 you split it with another family so i i worked at jp morgan private bank in college as an intern which at the time was the largest wealth management organization and and they had billionaires as clients who did not have family offices they hired jp morgan to be their family office but the really big clients at the firm would somewhat someone someone that would also have a family or would leave the firm to form it and so back then this is back in like 2004 like i don't think you had a family office unless you were like one of the top 50 richest people in the world it was my recollection of the time and then there and then and then came these ideas of multi-family offices where people share billionaires in our family office and now obviously things have become much more like i think there's more and more of this going on and so i think people are forming family offices you maybe have i thought a couple hundred million 100 million but what was amazing about my friend is that you know this is somebody who had more like low eight figures and had essentially formed a family office yeah i like the idea of the shared family office by the way that makes a lot of sense to me i'm surprised that doesn't happen more at like every level of wealth it does you could yeah there's like shared family off i mean i think that like once you get into like the 40 50 million range it makes sense to like do like three or four people together um but yeah for making less than 20 which is still a significant amount of money the idea of hiring a full-time staff is kind of outlandish and that's kind of cool so i have a similar setup i'm lucky that like the business i have make enough income where you know it's cool like this isn't it it's a business expense it right it's basically there's a lot of tax i would otherwise be paying um and so instead of paying tax i actually get this individual to actually grow the thing and um and so that was my logic but that might be sort of silly logic but it's definitely more than what most people do what do you think that it is it's already working as far as i'm concerned you know i think it's a fair trade yeah by the way i i agree more i mean investing in talent is just always pays off if you're if you're like willing to iterate and try and experiment and you're you have hustle and you work hard in my experience so i love it i i i hired a a bookkeeping firm in europe and they've created my books for my coaching business for you know renting my home for all of my investments and for my personal and then i have like an executive assistant who you know frees up a bunch of my time and i've been thinking about hiring somebody to just like manage my investments with me which is part of why i was mentioning this to sam the other day that my friend had this great success you know doing this and i think it makes all the more sense for you sean you know because you're obviously you're you're also operating labor-intensive businesses like where you have to like you know create things put them online like e-commerce and i mean i just think it's like i think it's a little nutty to do some of this because if you just kind of let your money sit like it's gonna grow pretty good doing boring ass [ __ ] and the question is is is doing all this extra stuff actually gonna work out if you do it for three decades you know what what will you perform better doing and sure sean you're crushing it now or i i think i bet you are because bitcoin is growing and the economy is booming but do you think that over the next 30 years that what do you think is going to be better for you um you know i think it's true that most people fail to just beat the passive index when you account for fees that's like been proven out but also you know most people is not all people so i think there is you know maybe having the network that we have in silicon valley is actually significant enough of an edge where this with this works for me i didn't think about it like an investor uh i need somebody to do but manage my money if it was just managed my money i would not i definitely wouldn't pay somebody in house to do it for me it was like cool i want to be you know creating content i want to be running this angel fund but i don't want to be taking all these meetings and i don't want to be you know like i'll be in a meeting you know i'll be in a business meeting and then my newsletter will go out and people will like look at their phone and be like how did you what is that and i'm like oh yeah like i don't write everything i don't send all this stuff i don't do the formatting i don't do all the research like i have somebody i really trust and we work together on it and i'm more the editor than the author and um and that's like the case for a lot of the different things i do when i was raising the rolling fund i didn't have time to go raise all the money i tweeted [ __ ] out and then a bunch of things came inbound and then my guy basically like took those inbounds and turned them into cash in the bank and i was like this is magic um he does that every week he goes through my dms and he's just like hey he gives me an excel sheet that says like for example for this clubhouse one it was insane it was like malcolm gladwell follows you now this guy follows you now this guy follows you now i'm gonna here's some dms i have as like something to say to them or they said this i'm thinking about replying this just say yes or no and i just say yes or no and then he does all of it right and it's like that is being in two places at once i'm down to pay for that i'm not really personally i don't think it makes sense for me to pay just for investment advisor or sort of a wealth manager from where i'm at i'm less vulnerable i think if you keep iterating on the concept you'll find that it's actually extremely lucrative to hire even into this this role because your rolling fund for instance imagine if you had someone just full time focusing on growing the the sean investment world i do know because sam so one thing i think you're missing out on is that it's not just investing your capital it's the ability for you to raise special purpose vehicles and syndicate and so i did uh i did i did my first one yesterday i raised a hundred fifty thousand dollars okay are you you can carry an interest on that yeah okay so imagine if you had someone full time spinning up more of those so that you were getting 20 you know carried interest in you know instead of one deal a month what if you're doing 10 deals a month but you would need you would need like some infrastructure around that yeah one of the coolest examples i think i think doing it though for investing is actually a little silly i mean it's not silly it's just it's hard because a lot of these angel investments won't pay money for eight years so what are you gonna like front the bill early on so i actually think what sean's doing is actually the right move because he if someone's working on other income generating things earlier like i think their investments westminster you just need to structure them differently two and twenty so the two percent in a in a hedge fund venture fund or private equity fund pays for your overhead it pays for your investment sean are you doing two percent i took zero percent management fee uh because i didn't know if anyone would really want to invest in the rolling fund so i was like okay why do i how do i differentiate from the other five people that are like me they're like an entrepreneur who's had an exit has done some angel investing and just spun up a rolling front because i was i think in the first 10 rolling funds i think i was one of the first 10 maybe 20. and so i knew there's gonna be like 100 more of these in the next quarter uh how do i like just quickly raise this amount and differentiate myself and i said well i hate [ __ ] fees i hate fees all the time so i was like i'm just gonna take no fees i have enough income coming in from other places that like i'll do this and i have a i have two full-time people that basically are not full-time i shouldn't say that i have two people that are dedicated one is this guy romine who you've probably seen on twitter he's a real smart guy he he himself owns a really successful big business uh manny has a podcast and he's like an investor himself and i basically said he went to college with me i said hey i need somebody to kind of manage my fund and take a bunch of these meetings because i don't have a ton of time and uh do you want to do it like we're going to invest in 25 30 companies a year you know so like if you want that experience while you're running your company before you eventually sell your company like let's do this and he's like x harvard mackenzie uh you know he's a former lawyer like he's a super sharp guy and then i have this other guy who's a scout that basically he works at on deck and he went through yc and he referred himself i think 20 companies into this yc batch so he's like boots on the ground sees everything before it even gets into yc and so those guys basically are doing my uh rolling funds you know one guy does the scouting and the other guy does the vetting and then i basically am doing the um the you know the final meetings with the founders and making the final decisions on a lot of those and so that's been a pretty sweet way to do this investing and now we're doing four million dollars a year of startup investing um you know that's up i was doing probably i don't know 200 000 a year before that so you know i was able to get massive leverage by doing this and i just agreed to split the carry with these guys because i'm taking no management fees i said hey you get a piece of my carry instead of me paying you a huge salary right this is how normal funds start they often start with little to no management fees in order to incentivize people to invest and then as they mature and grow reputation they start to charge management fees which is which is by the way a service to the investor because they don't want you to be understaffed and under under infrastructure like a really a really extreme where where this goes at the most extreme when i worked at carlisle i was pretty a pretty fun example of this is david rubinstein the the co-founder and the lead fundraiser at carlisle had a full-time equity analyst who would you know graduate from like yale or princeton who worked at merrill lynch who he would hire and he would go through these i think every few years all they would do all day is do research so that when he would speak on a podcast he would sound extremely intelligent because he knew everything that he needed to know about what's happening in china or dubai or whatever the whatever the topic of the day was because he had a team of people like you know you had a small little like crew working on this who were actually trained equity research analysts so you can imagine all the things you could invest in like people who make you know make sure that your research for your podcast for example which that i know sean has that and we have that uh or we're getting a lot more of that here all these investments are going to make your big cloud go up tying you back so ryan let's let's finish up the big club thing so you have put in uh tens of thousands of dollars into big cloud i believe and you are what is the strat you're using right now you're looking for undervalued basically like sam you said okay sean and sam about similar twitter followings but sean's coin is more expensive right now so i'm gonna buy a ton of sam and also they're in the same vehicle of my first million so like you know you know there's a good chance they'll they'll grow together so you saw sam as an undervalued asset is that the core thing you're doing basically just looking for the undervalued so so there's two main investment strategies and then there's multiple investment strategies under the second one so the first one is you just buy big cloud and you just bet on the whole platform and i'm probably going to keep like 60 of my money just in big cloud and then once you own big clout you can buy and buy creator coins right creator coins are like the sam coin the sean coin within that strategy i have a few strategies so one is i buy undervalued people like the sampar who until yesterday was valued at zero and i and i bet that he's gonna go up right and then there's people i've also bought some elon musk and some chamath and some of the people who are already trading at really high numbers because i just think it's the plot they're blue chippers popular people are going to go to the to the face the fang of bitcoin basically right that's like buying like you know it's like buying like yeah like walmart you know i was buying like you know champagne or naval um so and then i'm looking like i'm telling you chuck norris you watch chuck norris is gonna go up like austin reef at morning brew i think he's gonna go way up and he's gonna do better than sam because sam's kind of being a wuss about big clown from what i can tell i i think it's true i am being a little bit of a wuss i just can't tell if i'm just like so sam did you ever see old-fashioned did you see this thing that came out a couple years ago um by sikki chen called famous or it was also called stolen because there was two there's two versions of it was called stolen initially and then uh that was a little bit too controversial and they ended up having to change the name to famous and then even that can't do controversial they just had the whole app got taken down it was extremely viral so what what stolen and famous were was basically people started tweeting out one day just stole at seanvp just stole at the sam far [Music] and the stolen account had like the funniest buy i don't remember what it was but it was just like you know it wasn't trying to explain what it was it was like just like um super low key about the whole thing and so what it was was you could just go and if you place the top bid it was like you uh you have the hot potato like you owned that person because you made the winning bid and so it was an auction of people on twitter and so you could go and you could buy and have all you could buy ryan hoover you could buy all these people for some amount of money and then that would be like the winning bid somebody had to top you in order to take it and um and so it went super viral super quickly in the kind of like product tech silicon valley bubble and then i guess they didn't like the connotation of stolen so then they rebranded as famous af and so famous af started working and then it went so viral that it was going into schools and like bullying was happening because people were just stealing like classmates and then like dumping them or something like that i don't know what it was but like some teacher came out and was like or some mom came out was like dude my kid is getting bullied via stolen via via famous and this is like messed up and then apple took it off the app store because they were like what is this bullying app and so um and so that was the and so so sikhi who's the guy behind it he made sandbox vr and he's you know doing runway uh yeah yeah yeah cool new startup and so this guy's this guy's a gangster and so he he built these games and so now every time i see big clout and by the way anytime anybody sees big cloud that no seeky they're like oh this is it he's like dude i know like just stop saying to me like uh please to stop sending me if one more [ __ ] person sends me a big clout link you know i'm gonna lose my mind and uh so this has happened before and it did go viral before i think there's a very good chance that this goes viral again it has two kind of core things going against it one is um it's it looks a little bit shady and it's come across a little bit shady so far um and you have to have a password to get in so which is which is one of the reasons the friction of the password is one one major friction right that's why it's not going viral right now it's going viral within a small circle but not like super viral because it's not open to everybody yet and then the second thing is you have to you have to transfer in bitcoin in order to use it and so that already limits it right there's like just very few people who even own bitcoin so you know that's a big big gate in the way of this thing going crazy but everything else i think is it is engineered it is pro from a product design perspective this is designed brilliantly and this will grow in the way that it's designed well what uh spent the better part of yesterday trying to teach my mom and my sister how to create coinbase accounts transfer answer bit buy bitcoin transfer bitcoin uh sean do you think that angel investing like is this going to be what's the future of sean pray i mean do you think that this is going to be your full-time job angel investing is a way to for me it's like just dipping a net into a stream of flowing water with a bunch of fish inside i'm not taking a boat out spending you know an afternoon out in the water fishing and trying to catch something is this in front of my house there's this stream with fish going through and if i just put a net in i can catch some great fish that's what angel investing is for me and that's what it's been basically for the last i don't know six seven years where my own friends my own personal network or things that come inbound through getting more popular on twitter and the podcast it leads you to some opportunities people want you in their deals and you get to see deals early and before i used to sit on the sideline i watched a bunch of those companies get big and then i started you know i asked a rich friend hey if i give you a good deal that you invest in can i get a piece of the carry i said yeah that's how i got into lambda school which is already kind of like a big winner and then as soon as i did that i was like man instead of a big like instead of getting a piece of this guy's carry why can't i just do this myself so as i got a little more money i started doing it myself and then with the rolling fund that just lets me do it on steroids where i can just do more and so what percentage of your net worth well could let's be you can not answer this but let's just say that you invest four million dollars a year in eight years how much income do you think you're going to do you think you're going to make an additional 200 do you think you're going to make 200 grand a year do you think you're going to make sure a a good fund is going to like let's say 3x it's money over the kind of like seven to 10 year period uh great will be you know 5x or more and like if you're if you count if you caught an uber if you caught a coin base uh you know you're laughing your your returns are going to be super skewed just by this one company that's now worth tens of billions but let's assume for this conversation let's assume you're only so let's say you're the first um let's take let's take three x let's take the most cons like the most conservative version of winning right is i triple the money so over the next three years i'm going to deploy 12 million dollars let's say i 3x that money that's 36 million dollars um that gets that comes back into the fund after returning the money so uh so a total of 148 million dollars and so on the 36 that's the profit i get to keep twenty percent of the carry right so that's about seven million dollars-ish is my mental math right um you know roughly seven roughly seven million dollars and that's seven million dollars over a let's call it eight eight to ten year time span it's not the biggest like that's that's why i don't go all in on it is because i can make way more money building a business in that same amount of time so if i well in seven so but that's as a recap that's you're you're my did you how much in sev you say seven million years yeah that's a significant amount of money that's a million dollars a year so you're thinking this will make you a million dollars a year for seven years starting in seven years no i think it's like kind of like a lump sum that you get in seven years more more like it i get nothing for for seven years and then as these companies as the as many of them die and some of them do okay then a few winners emerge and eventually you reach a steady state where you keep going and you are making a millionaire yeah really what's interesting is where you scale and you start doing you know 20 million 50 million a year 100 million a year uh and you know eventually that's why you could see yourself hiring investment professionals you could have a whole fund haven't has any years paid out ryan yeah yeah but i i i think there's another important point is it's not just about money it's about well-being as i'm always saying on the show like it's about like what investing has done for me is it's been a vehicle for learning and for connecting to really interesting people and for like getting to like kind of like go on these fun adventures where i'm like learning about like the latest things in crypto or the latest things in e-commerce and i'm connecting dots and then the other thing it's done is it's made my my primary businesses far more successful because i'm borrowing ideas i'm learning like oh wow look how this e-commerce company does performance marketing i've never even heard of performance marketing until and then i brought it back to a newsletter company and like oh at our newsletter company we can buy facebook ads and google ads like this ecom company that i invested in called warby parker or whatever and like i'm now i'm like cross you know i'm taking you know i mean kind of like what your show has done a really nice job of your but does it no does it distract you from your main job well that's that's where like that's why i think it was smart that this guy hired some people and how you know sean's hiring some people because then then you can kind of like be as you said in two places at once but no that's you just have to you just have to take the risk of hiring a hundred and fifty thousand two hundred thousand dollars well you're not you don't have to i mean i i haven't done that and i've still made a bunch of investments but but i missed a lot of investments because of that very reason because i was like hey i'm really laser focused on biz now and summit and powder mountain i'm not going to look at a deal every day i'm going to look at like a deal every like three weeks and so i'm just going to miss a lot of stuff you know i missed like i mean i i have a one of my the ceo of my company invested 150 grand in a um in a in a crypto hedge fund and he's you know he's up to like almost six million dollars of value i don't know if i should be saying that here but you know he i missed that because i was just like i'm busy i can't look at that right now yeah that's totally true and by the way most of the time when people say like oh it's not about the money it's about the journey it's about the learning it's about the people you meet you know the kumbaya thing normally that's like you know that's the tell it's actually almost always about the money because if you took the money out they wouldn't do any of the [ __ ] this is actually one of the rare things where that's actually true because i actually was doing all these things i was meeting founders i was helping them with their businesses i was getting excited and digging into new spaces i was keeping a fantasy portfolio of like to learn like oh i'm tracking these spaces and i think these are going to be big and i want to learn about these spaces and here's some of the companies that are doing cool things and let me observe their growth tactics from the outside and try to see what's working and maybe apply that to my business i was literally doing all those things for fun before i ever put a dollar in uh you know i was subscribed to like i don't know 50 different um angel list syndicates because you didn't have to put money in but you could get the investment memo because i literally loved the learning so much and i had no plan at the time to be investing in any of those i put zero dollars in sorry to all those syndicate leads you know i was that annoying guy that was subscribed and never invested but it was because i actually genuinely actually wanted to learn and i wanted to meet these founders and so this is one of the rare occasions where when you hear that normally it's [ __ ] in this case i'm a hundred percent on board with which everyone and like that's how i that's exactly how i think about it is this is like a my other friend described it as like it it's a great way to just blow off some entrepreneurial steam it's like you your brain if you're operating a business you all of a sudden start hearing about vertical farming and crypto and then like you know oh what the hell is you know what the hell are nfts and like you learn about all this [ __ ] and then part of you is like should i be doing that like what the [ __ ] am i doing this stupid like real estate newsletter i should be going out there building you know this ride sharing company or whatever and so investing gives you a way to like get the high and dabble in that and have some financial upside but you don't it lets you stay focused as an entrepreneur so that's the other like like weird psychological things that comes from investing is um aside from the learning aside from the good friends you make and the network you build and the learn you know the cross ideas you get you literally just get to like it's like a release and uh and then you can go back to doing your thing do you but but are you sean are you the reason i i did the syndicate thing i'm doing it with joe and where i i bet my own money it's it's kind of like a rolling fine but it's not uh it's only deal by deal basis where sean you have like money that you could deploy a little more freely i didn't do the rolling fun thing because i didn't want to have customers that i have to uh appease and talk to on a regular basis because i didn't want like a job do you feel know now that you have like a job because you have a hundred people who have given you yeah no i write a once a month update uh and i like doing it anyways it's just hey here's the new companies we invest in why i would do that for my own documentation anyways of what was the conviction at the time i made the investment here's what i believe here's why i believe investing in it i like having that anyways for five years from now that's an important thing for me so in this case i just publish it to my investors great so that's the that's all the maintenance that goes into it there was a little bit again early on of like actually getting the investors on board but i took no meetings i took no phone calls i just said here's the link and because of this podcast because of my newsletter because of my own track record and the deck i made that was enough to raise the money for me and i know that that's kind of like a not everybody can do that part most people would have to go knock on a bunch of doors and really sell this thing um so that's that but the other thing you mentioned like for you if you just get busy and you just don't care about angel investing you could just not do a deal for the next six months and no sweat whereas for me i actually do need to deploy this money and so there is like a certain amount of like startup pitches i need to take every month in order to be doing great investments um and so you know i actually have to deploy this money i can't like just sit on my hands and decide i want to go go on vacation or like just go super heads down in my own business i can't like i can't do that because i've taken on a fiduciary like obligation to deploy these people's cash right what i thought would be man i used to invest i don't know like 50k a quarter 100k a quarter max and now i have to deploy a million dollars a quarter and actually i run out within the first two months of every quarter so so it's actually not been an issue because i just my check sizes are bigger and once people know you're investing they send you deals your friends send you deals they're like hey i'm doing this this is a good deal and they're like oh wow i didn't need to like the fundamentals make sense and all is all the good there's other good go co-investors there i didn't need to go find this deal it came to me uh and that's that's the best thing that happens what percentage of what percentage of your liquid net worth did you allocate to before this because now with the rolling fund i'm investing rpm right other people's money i only put a small amount of my own money for the fund before this i was doing roughly 200k 250k a year was what i put in and i don't remember what that was at that time of like liquid net worth it was like kind of substantial like it was it wasn't wasn't i don't know half a percent or something it was like like that mattered to me but also if i lost that money or if like i knew going in at the very least this money is locked up for a long time i can't use it to go buy a vacation over or under 15 over under 15 or 10 percent like was it more than like 10 because that's a lot i don't know i don't have to think what i i don't know how much money i made at the time because i made more money in the last couple years than i did back then so i don't know actually how much money i had then what i do remember is thinking when i very first started i thought i need about 300 000 of a bankroll to even do this to have enough of a portfolio to give myself a shot because angel investing so many of your deals are going to be losers and so i thought okay i need to have you know 20 to 30 bets i need at least 300 to 500 000 of bankroll to go do this and at that at the very beginning i didn't have that that would have been an irresponsible amount of money for me that was like at the time i don't know half of the money i had or something like that so i said okay i can't do that that's why i started talking to other people and being like hey if i scout for you can i get carrie and you put up the capital and that's how i got started although you know operate go ahead even when you have almost no money i i really like this as opposed to buying public equities when you have very little money because of the learning and the connections and like the benefit that that could have on your own business like i was betting a very high percentage of my money initially and it really helped me because i rather than just buying like coca-cola or walmart or some publicly traded company where i learn nothing i meet no one you know i it doesn't really help like the day-to-day of my like newsletter business or my community business or you know the the real estate business if these things were basically benefiting my ability to make money on my day job so that's why i i actually think when you're small it's actually not a terrible idea and in fact a high point i've read a tim ferriss thing a while back he wrote a long time ago before before he started investing and he was basically like i'm just going to fund my own mba like if i was going to spend 200k yeah business school i think i can learn more investing that 200k in a mix of you know public stocks and private you know startups and when i read that i was like oh absolutely like i will build a network i will build business knowledge i'll have skin in the game and actually this might become a profitable thing you know but the worst case scenario this was my rather than going to you know wichita state and like going get my mba like why would i not do this so once i read that that's how i started thinking about it was like i'm going to put 120k in that's like a you know that's business school and let me let me just get going well so we we not only thought about that with investing but we we lost 25 000 on the first summit we held various private summits in between summits where we would lose 20 grand here 10 grand there to throw like an event and i always saw that as an investment like you're saying like in like my network or my learning and the same thing i was talking to a guy the other day about he wanted some coaching and he was like debating whether i was worth like the monthly amount and he had like 400 grand in his savings and i was like well what do you want to do what else do you want to do with the 400 grand he wanted to put it into like robin hood and buy stock and i was thinking like man if i had known about coaching or consulting or some of the things i now know about you know like trainings that you could go get online you're taking like a writing course from like you know parel online like those things are so valuable like they're so worth the like three grand here the five grand there that if you have you know a little bit of money saved i think that's so much better than trying to make like you know the index return on the stock market when at least when you don't have that much money i i think um somebody said to me you know concentrate to get rich diversify to stay rich like when you don't have much money like put your money into building yourself up building up your learning building up your network and then later when you're when you're much richer then diversify and have a you know an allocation and a portfolio like that i don't know if we're gonna get so like sean do you agree i think the clips that we're doing are like the greatest thing that's like one of the most proud things i am of my career even though they're all of you it's like it's the most proud thing that like i'm so proud of that and i'll we i don't even know if anyone has made it this far but we're gonna we uh we hired i can tell you we hired these we were just about done with the contract they're gonna be doing 30 to 60 a month across the whole hustle organization and you and i can take up as many as we want um i think that they are the greatest thing ever and all i want to do is talk in talking 120 second bytes so it becomes uh ryan you got to google google the hustle on instagram and you'll see these clips i'm talking about they're getting like sean sean did one the other day that uh the michael jordan thing i think it has 150 000 views at this point um me and zach did one where that has 80 000 views like it's so fun it's the most proud i am so i don't know if we're gonna get any clips out of this i feel like if if the guys by the way the guys who are listening to this and doing it if you don't feel like you get a great big clout clip from this message me on slack i'm gonna record a clip worthy bitcloud thing because i know how you guys will animate it because we have to get a bit cop clip that has to happen you through either the stuff you got out of this wait or i will say a full like two-minute monologue i wanna i wanna do a clip too let's all do it let's all get them let's go they're they're really good you chad's not sean's naturally good at it i think i'm okay at it uh ryan you gotta talk way faster to get good at it you gotta like you have to pack these with information and you have to talk really fast that's kind of hard that's good i have to jump because i have uh a i'm getting back to baby that b i have a very i'm gonna literally go execute a shake down uh right now and i can't wait to see what happens if i get shot you know hey this was my last hurrah by my big clout in my memory but uh i got to go shake down somebody who stole something from me and uh get it back because uh i know who hasn't god i love you i remember you you were talking about this one said you were like dude i would go back and you said you have done it or you said you would go do it i have done it and i'll remember to help myself at the time being like this guy's a maniac i would never do that and now i'm so enraged that the person stole and also like there's no other recourse the cops are like well you know what are we gonna do like you're the [ __ ] cops and like you know the you know the lawyers like well you could try to like sue him but you know just don't cross the line [ __ ] him like don't hurt don't don't physically hurt him just just yeah the cops were like here's what okay they're like once they understood what i wanted they're like oh you need something called a civil assist and a civilization where cop goes with you you say i'm going to confront somebody and a cop goes with you to ensure that nothing goes down just as a thought so to let it go and think of it as oh my god you know right let it be angry i understand don't tell them to forget about this person will keep stealing unless they understand that we know that they're stealing and we can stop them from doing it so uh me just well you can you could say to them i i hey by the way i know you're stealing and i'd really appreciate it if you don't steal enjoy the things you've already stolen no and uh i'd really appreciate if you would like anymore all right do you realize how house how much rage drives people to be successful and how much we're events i don't want you to tell me to forget about it i want you to teach me how to use my rage to fuel me to be better dude there's such funny things you can do with this someone's been stealing my bike seat outside my house here i've been it's been stolen twice in the last six weeks and like you know you could just put a note outside like here's i'm gonna put i'm gonna go buy a few extra bike seats and just leave them out for them i think you put a nice dude note out there with some lemonade no taste them what the holes no don't write them a note i want you to like tase them all right come on come to miami oh you're going to tease him i'm gonna give him lemonade and we'll let's let's see how it all plays out man now i'm torn i'd rather your shoulder telling me to you know turn the other side and go today go to amazon type in paddle prod order the top one meditation cushion yeah that's right you do your way i'll do my one guys yeah i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back

chrome plug-ins and i'm like well this company duolingo is very successful it's a five billion dollar company i think um i i've been thinking about chrome plug-ins what i think is like do two things one look at successful companies already that do over 100 million in sales and just say well how can i just create this in the form of a google plugin or two which behaviors do people want but they don't do it because there's a little bit of friction and how can i use this plug-in to alleviate that friction right now there's a ton of downside with google plugins you know you're a google plugin so google can ruin you but it's incredibly incredibly incredibly interesting to me and that's what i wanted to bring up was some google plug-in stuff and so basically what this i don't know if this is how she did it but she basically um uh or the way that i look at it is you just look at what is what what behaviors are people already doing so for example learning a language people already want to learn a language you just change the text of the article to a different language or at least parts of it grammarly did this with grammar so you just fix it as you write one that i use all the time is similar web so it tells me the traffic of someone's website passwords you use passwords on a regular basis so a plug-in just inserts different passwords and loom is another one have you heard of loom oh yeah my buddy was with the guy who started it isn't that worth like a billion dollars uh not yet but getting close it's several hundred millions i think it was the last round and all it does is uh screen record recordings yeah so so they basically say oh you want to show something on your screen here's a click boom record share um so the two famous ones that everybody kind of has heard about is honey because honey sold to paypal for several four billion four billion dollars so honey had i think 17 million users when they sold and what honey does is if you're about to go check out on some website honey will go in the background it's looking for is there is there a deal on this is there a coupon for this or a sale for this somewhere else or a coupon you can use right now and it's surface is a discount okay that makes total sense i don't have to take an action i have to remember to go look for a coupon it's just gonna do it and the honey sign just glows whenever it has a discount available for you so that was one grammarly was another that i think shocks people because grammarly does over 100 million dollars a year so the grammarly founder spoke at hustlecon and he's an engineer he's like a very um by the book like straight shooter engineer he's really cool his name's max and i was like shooting the [ __ ] with him and i was like dude a freaking plug-in who would have thought and he kind of had like a funny [ __ ] eating grin on and i was like how big are you guys he was like we do over 100 million dollars a year in sales and i was like would you ever believe it he was like yeah i thought it could be done and then and then i go you just raise money he goes yeah we raised 100 million the other day i go why he goes because it was at a one north of a billion dollar valuation yeah i was like oh my god you pulled it off yeah they did it exactly um so those are like the big successors but there are some other ones right so we have pinterest was started as i believe a chrome chrome extension so it was uh the pin the pin button that basically was able to get all the content for pinterest to be a cool app uh you needed a quick way to pin while you were surfing the web so that was one and then there's others that like like for example if i look at the plugins that i have installed i have adblock or you know you block origin or whatever um that's definitely one of them and so i think i think this was one of those non-obvious ideas because it kind of feels like not a serious company it's like dude you're just making this like plug-in and definitely there's a lot of people like my mom doesn't know what chrome extensions are she doesn't know there's a chrome extension store she doesn't really know how to install them like she knows apps but she doesn't know chromic stuff so you're going to get a little bit more of a tech savvy audience you know it's a smaller market overall but the first one is a big deal i actually want to change your opinion of that so i went and looked at the numbers there's 1.6 billion iphone users okay 1.6 billion users 2 million iphone apps in the store right now chrome users 3 billion chrome users 200 000 plugins there's a ton of opportunity here i hear you that like your mom doesn't know how to do this but does your mom if she saw a commercial on tv for grammarly i bet you she would know what to do you just go to grammarly.com actually she doesn't grammarly because of that she saw it and she's self-conscious about her english because she learned english later in life and she like doesn't want to write something stupid so she downloaded grambly for that reason actually and so that's why when i saw this toucan thing i was like oh you guys just run a commercial for this on tv that's easy you're going to get so many users and the the plug-in the reason why the plug-ins are interesting to me is the churn is so low churn on plug-ins are so low compared to iphone apps or and we've been so we both have plug-ins you have a plug-in for the hustle i have a plug-in for my my one big thing framework of just like what's the turn on one there's like no churn on it do we have like thousands of users now the engagement's not super high like they don't always use the thing uh but they leave it installed and it's like you know so so we've both dabbled in this not seriously i would say neither of us took it super seriously but we were interested enough for both of us to build a chrome extension and get it out there to you know five ten thousand people it's interesting and i think that uh um i just think that people discount it and i think that it's far more it's far more interesting than most people realize and so i actually had a brave pull some of the biggest uh plugins so it's uh block ad block plus adobe acrobat what do you use adobe acrobat for i don't know probably like flash or something i don't know um safe price which is a deal thing video conferencing from uh cisco google translate which is kind of an indicator about for toucan which is interesting honey pinterest say button skype what's uh tamper monkey uh i don't know it looks like it's trying to keep you safe dude there was a cool one called ghostery back in the day that would just show you who who's trying to track you on every website you go to that was kind of cool and try to shut that down uh there's also these paid ones so are there was there anything interested in the paid group no but tell me about the ones that you've invested in because they're actually similar because i and so in this document that we have i said screenshots would be great and you said oh i invested in this thing called bubbles which i remember you telling me about it but what is that bubbles is a lot like loom which we talked about earlier so the idea is how do you easily share what's on your screen with your co-worker who wants to see it and be able and so how do you do that some people just take a screenshot right they use the hotkey on their keyboard they take a screenshot and it goes into their desktop file then they have to go grab that then they drag and drop that to their friend and then the friend has to comment on it but they can't comment on it they have to like send it back as another file it's kind of annoying right so what bubbles does is much simpler it says it's a little chrome extension and on any page you go to you can say i want to record a screen recording like a video i want to take a screenshot or my favorite one is a scroll screenshot so like you know when you're on a website that like is long and you want to take screenshots of the website you have to take like eight screenshots and then send them as separate files to somebody yeah it's a pain with this it just takes one long screenshot and sends it to the person so it's it's easy to capture the what's on your screen you can then comment like bubbles so it's like a speech bubble so you just click anywhere where you want to point something out on the screen like let's say for the hustle you want to make the trends website better you would click bubbles you would record a screenshot you would tap on the part of the screen where you're like this thing is stupid we need to change this and you would write this thing at stupidity changes and then that's a the whole file is a link you just share a link with somebody else and they can comment back like a google doc and so is it doing well yeah it's doing well it's doing well specifically actually i think the niche initial niche that they've done well with is agencies and so agencies like creative agencies there's always creative people within the team that are sending ideas mock-ups concepts back and forth with each other and then they have to share with the client also and the client has to give feedback so there's a lot of showing screen stuff and commenting back and forth on it and so that's where they're getting an initial foothold and i think it'll kind of break out from there so it's like loom but it does more than what loom does and what's dashworks so dashworks is a company investment that is it's like the homepage for your company so this is this is a chrome extension that's sold to companies so let's say somebody joins the hustle you give them their laptop if you work with dashworks when they when they open up their google chrome for the first time to use the internet they would not just see like the generic google like new tab page they would see like the hustle's branded page and that page can do three things one there's a search bar and you could type in anything into that search bar and it'll find the file inside your company so like most companies now use slack and google drive and dropbox and asana and github and like all these different tools that are all in the cloud so like if you've ever been on your macbook and you want to find a file you just use like the little spotlight search finder right you just type it into spotlight it finds the file on your computer but the thing is now with the cloud none of the files you need are on your computer they're all in the cloud so this is basically that search bar for all your cloud apps so now so what it does is it helps any any employee find any file that's in your network without knowing where to go to find it right it's just like networking yeah this is cool so then the second thing you could do is you could search anyone's name so i could be like oh what does steph smith do with the hustle i type steph it'll show me her profile show me what she does who she reports to and that sort of thing and then the last thing is that um you as the kind of ceo or your kind of your your admin at the company can post announcements or updates that will show up in their chrome like new tab bar so you can be like oh welcome these new employees or like happy birthday to this person or hey remember this friday we're all doing you know happy hour or whatever and so it's a kind of a communication pipe also so that i that i thought was cool they're taking the chrome extension to deliver critical internal company stuff a search for people search for files and and internal announcements so um this this is interesting and another one i actually don't know how to say this company but you wrote it in here how do you pronounce that luster uh jack our friend jack was one of the early users and i think invested in it and he says that it's awesome but basically they look at wire cutter amazon and dozens and dozens of other sources and anytime you have a product in front of you it tells you the average review um kind of interesting i don't know how i think it's a little better than that i think what they do is you say yourself yeah my description was about a year ago you you i think what it does is you go on amazon or whatever and you search for flat screen tv and uh you know it's there's so many products out there and all of them you know great it's four stars what what do i make of that um and so what lustre does is try to make the buying process simpler so it'll basically say here's the recommended option for what you searched for is the mo this rrai has searched all the reviews all the different websites has all this data to tell us that this is the most popular result for what you're looking for and then here's the high-end version of it and here's maybe the low-end version of it um and so i don't know if the product has evolved too much since then but that's what it kind of did at that time was it would help you figure out which product should you actually buy using data and again you didn't have to remember to go to luster it was a chrome extension so you're just on any website shopping you can go to walmart go to amazon you go bestbuy.com wherever you're searching and luster will be like hey here's the product we recommend and here's why here's what the reviews say about it summarized automatically for you which i thought was pretty cool i think that that's a this could be a good product when he pitched it to me and when jack told me about it i was like this is stupid i'm not in uh i understand though i actually i think i i was wrong about it it's really cool um yeah so the founders was really smart and and um for this one he showed me a chart uh a graph that was doing pretty well so here's some other ideas of things so those are ideas that we've either invested in or seen i have a couple more for you so let's use your framework of take a popular app like duolingo that shows that there's a need or a demand people want to learn a language and you make it a chrome extension as the user experience instead of a mobile app so or at least one of the main widgets or main points of distribution right so let's take meditation right you have headspace you have calm um why don't you have a chrome extension a chrome plug-in that will basically say it'll see you know you've been on you've been browsing for two hours straight you've had you have 85 tabs open hey let's take a minute would you like to earn some earn some mindfulness points and take one minute quick meditation and it just you tap the thing it turns on there's a clock and there's like a guided voice that's doing a guided meditation for you i think so i think i think meditation delivered through a chrome extension could work because it's so popular as a mobile app but again for mobile app you have to remember to go do it whereas this could just kind of like as you go it could pause you and uh and help you out that's great i think that has that has legs uh i'll i'll i'll keep going with this game um do you know the you know how do you on your iphone what's that thing called where it blocks you from using a website after a certain amount of time oh yeah like time something i don't know i don't know what you do i never use that [ __ ] no do you yeah i mean i have it installed screen time screen time um i used to have this chrome plug-in called nukem i think it was called newcomb or the option was called newcomb where after a certain amount of time you would nuke your website and you cannot go to certain websites so you could only go to like google docs email and that was it uh i loved it so similar to meditation i would 100 try to create more of a of of these uh what do you call this uh change your stop using stuff app right right right yes defend yourself against yourself okay i have a smart idea and i have a gimmick idea which one you want okay smart one or the gimmick one smart one first all right smart one first okay we had the founder of you mentioned the founder of superhuman he's the guy who built rapportive before that we both loved rapportive it doesn't exist now so some people might not know what it is but what reported was doing was when you were emailing somebody as soon as you typed in their name or their email a little sidebar would pop out of your email that would just show you their face show you their name show you the last few tweets it was like at the time it was like magic we were like how on earth do they know all this it was it just makes you a more thoughtful person because you can see the person you can see what they're up to you can click their linkedin and get a little more information and it kind of did like it served it up it was like you had an amazing assistant executive assistant who was like you know by the way sir you need to know this about this person so i think you could take rapportive all around the web so i think you could make it where anytime it sees a name on a web page it just highlights it yellow and then if you just hover over that it'll just tell you something about that person so i think you could bring this idea of like anytime you see a name tell me a little bit more about that person i could think you could turn that into a chrome extension rather than something that was just for email how would you make money off of it um ads boom that's my easy answer i don't know oh all right okay but here's my gimmick one which definitely needs ads so uh i think there should be a chrome extension let me take that back i don't think this should exist i think this would be funny if somebody tried to do this um so if you ever remember million dollar homepage it was kind of this cool idea of like here's a web website there's a million pixels on the page buy a buy pixel and sponsor it okay that's cool i have i've always thought about similar ideas how could you make a million bucks of something simple and goofy and there's this concept in in the bitcoin world of i think it's called a fountain or a tap it's basically a website where you go to and then sometimes there's like a thing about like a spout like a fountain and uh sometimes bitcoin free bitcoin comes out and so a bunch of people like to go to these to so some projects use these to say like go collect your coin for my new coin go there and get some and you would go to the website you like collect some of the new coin that you can get and then other people have done this be like hey sometimes something comes out sometimes it doesn't it's a game of chance it's like a um what do they call this they call it a um there's this company that did this with candles we talked about them it was called like diamond candles i think and at the bottom of every single candle we're talking candles like a wax candle that you burn in your bathtub or whatever like like cool candles that's [ __ ] the only way i'd want to use [ __ ] candles is what i'm saying i like you start dropping f bombs to like get masculine real quick while talking about bathtub candles yeah i gotta [ __ ] dude i use my my bath bombs or what are they called uh yeah anyway i've got all of them i'm i'm a sensitive guy man and anyway uh they at like one in ten thousand candles probably has a one thousand dollar diamond right the rest have like nothing right something but like a like a like a cracker cracker jack ring and what you could do with this is you could always have coupons or discounts off of something and if you redeem them you get the chrome extension gets a kickback but every once in a while one out of x does get a bitcoin right yeah so something like that where basically every time you open a new tab there's a little little package in the middle of the screen you give it a quick click and then you're either gonna get nothing you get air you get you know a tiny little something it's like a puzzle piece or you know maybe like a little something i don't know something or you can actually get some bitcoin you can get you can get a little satoshi's basically and so it would just become this little like the little hamster game where every time you open a new tab are you really going to not click the thing and um and so i think you could get a lot of people to install this to try to get free bitcoin while they just browse the internet every time they open a new tab it's like a little mini scratch off lotto ticket that they get to scratch off that might have some crypto inside and um you could give away little [ __ ] coins you could give away micro amounts of bitcoin you can give away little puzzle pieces and if you get it right it's like the monopoly game at mcdonald's we actually earned the bitcoin if you get all the pieces you can make a game out of it basically and uh and then the rest of the screen you just plaster with ads or sometimes what comes out of the box is just an ad and uh i think that's how you make money off of my gimmick chrome extension well i hope someone tries this because i think it would be hilarious that they create a product out of your joke i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road less travel never looking back
