back to the point of you know getting possibly deep and you know I'm doing stand up for about two years I think I'm the fastest comic to ever get a network special at Showtime so I was like no for the most part people like oh this guy's you know two years this is good for him no man when you do that what happens is it actually pushes you further away from them [Music] we're live now burning shop what's going on I'm Sam this is Sean um we just get right into things but we uh Sean and I have been huge fans of you for a long time we're both huge UFC fans we go to a bunch of those shows been watching you in front of the kid for a while uh then the show with Theo Von yeah that was awesome so we've been fans forever I think uh we each actually might have a thick Boy shirt I love it I love the shirt just the body actually so I'm a real fan I went all the way Dixon the heart fellas thinks in the heart I don't drink otherwise I would have your your whiskey whiskey but you know you do lots of stuff uh like I'll I'll kind of give like what I know about you but basically you were you're from Colorado played a little bit uh in the NFL I don't know if you actually made the cut entirely but you were like very serious uh for the Broncos went into the UFC you did awesome you knocked out some great guys uh and then uh you got into Show Business via podcast so you originally were just on Joe Rogan a bunch eventually launched your own thing and now you have fighter in the kid but you also have like three or four other podcasts right that I don't know how how big are they I mean I know that you get you have uh hundreds of thousands of subscribers and each video gets like hundreds of thousands of views but I actually don't know like how big the Empire is yeah sure so just going back to like the football yeah so I played uh at University of Colorado for the Buffs who they just got Deion Sanders so I'm excited about that um and then I had a a cup of coffee with the Buffalo Bills and I got there and they're like we're all set on slow white guys so that broke my heart and then I uh and then I uh yeah then from there I was selling supplements door to door I like Pursuit of Happiness style and then I started training in Jiu Jitsu and boxing and then you know you know I'm fighting grown men in a steel cage my underwear and then uh two years after I started trading I was uh in the UFC I made it through the ultimate fighter who has a finalist there with Kimbo Slice right yeah yeah it was the biggest season with the shot Evans and Rampage uh Jackson so yeah then you know shortly after that you know there's a common theme in my life it's like I get put in the deep end man it goes zero to 100 in every aspect of my life it's just this common theme throughout my entire career whether it's comedy football fighting whatever it is podcasting I get thrown in the deep and I gotta figure it out so I was in the UFC and then probably two years in the UCM 19 I'm ranked top 10 in the world you know and it was terrifying um but then slowly after that I um I moved to LA because I grew up in uh Venice Beach in the summers at my uncle's house when I was a young boy my dad would always bring me out here for the Summers so I always felt you know a weird connection to Los Angeles so once I could make the move I made the move and then I started a podcast this is damn near 11 years ago 12 years ago I started a podcast called The Fighter and the kid with Brian Cowan and yeah that thing took off and then now fast forward to 2023 I own a a podcast Network so uh thick Boy network where we have uh you know probably around seven shows you know so yeah so between the fire and the kid the shop show food truck Diaries uh fight companion uh the golden hour you know it's uh it's going well it's a lot of work it's a lot of work yeah your uh your output's pretty insane and you know the thing about you you said you got thrown in the deep end and you're kind of right like transitioning from football to UFC was a really short transition and then you're doing it at that kind of the high level you're in the actual UFC it takes most guys like long long amateur Journey then they go to a small promotion they go to a bigger promotion you kind of fast track that and then in comedy you did the same thing where you kind of went from I'm a UFC fighter I'm a comedian so I got a special on Showtime really fast and I think there's yeah probably I don't know I don't know how you think about it now but like there's good and bad with with that fast track on one hand you learn fast on the other hand you kind of get your ass kicked because you're pushing the boundary further than maybe you were ready for or had and you're learning publicly yeah there you go correct so it's uh you know in hindsight looking at it even when I was in the UFC learning comedy I just I wish I had people around me that went slow down man now I'm fighting you don't really have that option once you're in the UFC you know it's the big league so you know they call you with Merkel Crow cop or Matt mitrione or it's you know Brock Lesnar you got to take the fight so you really don't have control there I could have been smarter about making decisions when I was young you know and had a lot of belief in myself and you know eventually that experience catches up with you you know I was a lot more athletic than a lot of those heavyweights that's why I excelled so fast but again that's a blessing and a curse because if you get to a level where you're fighting these vets with 40 50 fights and they've seen a athletic dude you know with a good right hand and you know good wrestling but you know eventually you know you're this cheat code and it catches up to you there's nothing replaces The Experience so um that was a blasting and a curse a blessing as far as I was able to transition get out and build a fan base and go into something I've always wanted to do living comedy you know really you know it's true when I started comedy you know um I have some great mentors you know and Joe Rogan's like a brother and Brian I have just this plethora of just amazing Comics that was around and I I was only you know I'd go to dinner with them and do all you know the podcasts with them make them laugh and they all encouraged me to do stand up which I you know always wanted to do since I was a child so you know everyone told me it's gonna be 10 years before you find your voice I'm like yeah that one you know I'm never scared of hard work let's do it so the issue with that is you know I get catapulted you know I'm instead of doing open mics you know when my first uh things I did was uh you know Chicago Theater you know um the Vic Theater which is how did you even start because it's a big jump from oh this dude's funny when we hang out cratch jokes bus ball oh yeah this guy this guy's good he's a funny guy to you're on stage and you got to do a set that's like that's like a it's like a different thing altogether and you know me and Sam we try to like um we try to be uh funny in our little pond it's like you don't know how to be that funny to be the funniest business podcast so we're we're a dwarf among midgets is what we are yeah it's like it's like everyone has that funny uncle at the party you know and if you're you know if you're your brother's like man I think you're really funny that there's a big difference between your family and friends going oh you're funny man you should try to stand up and then Burt Chrysler Joe Rogan Joey Diaz Brian Cowan Crystal and Theo Von going dude you need to stand up what did you even do though to develop that first set are you reading a book are you uh are you just going to Joe Rogan's house with a notepad and being like hey yo how do I write this [ __ ] oh no it's like sink or swim soaked you know I had my 10 000 reps on podcasts with comedians keeping up with them making them laugh being killed really quick at it and then really it's almost the perfect situation in order to get started in stand up because the final kid got you know so popular we do live finding the kids but remember Brian does been in comedy for 30 years so when they we got offered to do a live fighting the kid I told Brian I'm like you ever been to a live podcast they suck it's two guys they're the worst dude everybody is no man no no I've been showing business with 30 years we're gonna do a performance so I go okay what do you want to do so we came up with this whole idea to make it a show and uh Brian at the time knew I wouldn't do stand-up but he didn't want to I guess scare me because it is scary you know just what she's doing friendly sold out crowds when most people are doing open minds to 15 other salty comets you know so for me you know doing it a sold out crowd Brian go all right here because Brian was always late to the podcast you know I'm very professional I'm I'm not late I'm never late in whatever 12 years of podcasts I've never been late it's not what I do so Brian would be late and he used to drive me nuts I used to roast him every time come in late he was like so our first live show let's keep up with the theme we're gonna pretend I'm late I'm not there and you got to start the show by yourself so you're gonna tell a story for 10 minutes and I'll come in you get all upset we do the whole act I'm like all right cool I'm like I can handle that so I tell a story just get telling stories so that carries on for you know four or five shows and then again we're at like for your probably Portland OR Seattle some sold out theater and uh I'm backstage before the the crowd I'm pretty nervous I told Brian I go man I don't know what store I'm going to tell and you know Brian was like frantic he was again he's looking for something he goes what I don't know what stormy and tell you what are you talking about story no you're doing stand-up dumbass I was like oh and then it just clicked I'm like oh so storytelling you just told me that because you don't want to scare me because crap you're doing stand-up dude and I was like oh that's what I'm doing so shortly after that I come to realization like this is stand up it's just your way of doing it so then um we do a live fight in the kid at The Comedy Store you know the world famous comedy store which as a kid was like you know the mecca it's like Madison Square Garden for basketball so I uh we do their Comedy Store goes great and then six weeks or six days later I'm driving I get a call from the meds with Comedy Store Emily and she calls me and she goes hey Brad this is Emily at the comedy story how you doing she was a great show the other day I'm like thank you she goes hey we're seeing if you'd like to do a set in the belly room give give you six minutes I go let me call Brian Cal and see if he's available she was no dumbass just you you had a great set the other night like me you want me to do stand-up and Comedy Store she goes yeah it's in the small room in the belly room but if you want six minutes it's yours so I was like say less so I did that I mean there was just you know that was in 2014 2015-ish like early 2015 probably right around end of 2014 and then just you know you get that bug and then it's Off to the Races man you know I knew it was you know it takes a takes a lot of work but back to the point of you know getting possible deep end you know I'm doing stand up for about two years I think I'm the fastest comic to ever get a network special at showtime and you know I I just in in my eyes I thought at the time I'm proud of that special I challenge any comment just with that two years two years to do a network special and have 60 Minutes you know now is it as good as Bill Burr special no but in my head I thought people would see that and go oh my God for only do it two years look at this guy see how much better he's gonna get in four years and five years and ten years and where's gonna be on 15 years but a lot of people don't have that Insight they don't give a [ __ ] about that yeah they don't see it like that and you know and again you know this is a while ago so I was young and I I always it might be it could be an asset or it could be a huge gaping hole that I have but I always see the best in people in society like I don't pay attention to hate everything's all good you know I just I you know I gravitate towards positivity so I was like no for the most part people like oh this guy's you know two years this is good for him no man when you do that what happens is it actually pushes you further away from them I thought it would bring me closer to being legit and be like my peers no it pushes you farther away because a lot of those guys that I mentioned earlier on and even outside of those guys a lot of famous comedians it took them 15 20 years ago Network special so there's a lot of it's not even jealousy it's just like you know it just rubs people the wrong way and I didn't see that coming I gotta be honest and I don't think really anybody did you know but it is what it is you know you do that and you move on and you just keep grinding and you go to the next one the next one so um yeah it's been interesting man it's been really interesting I learned on the Fly I also learned the hardest way that's the only way I make changes I learned the hard way so um I wouldn't change anything you know things are pretty good are you the the CEO of the network now I mean so you're having to be the talent and you're running the business yeah heavy lies the crown man so I grew up in a business-minded family my dad's entrepreneur um you know she's always been business-minded I have a a double major from University Colorado and sociology and business so I was gravitated towards business and you know I worked for showtime for six years I built the entire you know podcast branch which is crushing it now and shout out to Brian Daly and you know at the end of six years so this is December last year 2022 six months prior they offered me another six year contract and I I'm just looking around and Showtime was great to me you know I was getting a salary and you know they're reaping the benefits it was good for both sides I thought man I I feel like I could do this on my own you know I am an entrepreneur I feel like I could I see what they built and you know and I've helped them out a lot they've helped me out a lot I feel like I can invest in myself and do this on my own so I turned down the contract I was like I'm gonna do it on my own start think boy Studios and I owned all the IPS to all the shows that I started with them so I brought that over and it's you know in hindsight I didn't there's Eli I don't really know who to talk to nobody in my Lane kind of has done this where you leave a major Network in podcasting and bring it over on your own and it's a different animal when you're not only in your talent but you're also running because you're very busy raise money for that or did you just self-fund it what'd you do yeah I still funded it from all the other shows and stand up I just put all my money into that and then whenever I start a new thing I'm like you know people are like oh congrats and I'm like ah ask me in a year like we'll find out what's gonna be fun to find out like this is either a bad idea it's an all right idea or it's an amazing idea we'll find out because you know I go into things relatively blind like I don't do a ton of research before I go into things but I you know I Got Confidence I'll figure things out eventually but the reality is that some some ideas are better than others so a year in now owning your own podcast network is this a bad idea good okay good idea or is it an amazing is it an amazing business I think it's still too early to tell oh medium where you're in financially am I making more money yes but you know that can't just be the the main focus you know because my life's more complicated you know my life's more complicated I have less free time so what's that worth you know so there's like these pros and cons I didn't think about because at Showtime I was the talent I would create shows they would make it happen you know and they would have the employees and the creative team and the producers and the editors and I was I would come up with ideas they would execute it I would sit down knock it out great get paid for that and move on and just not worry about to you know the next day or the next week now it's a little different now you know um I would say one of my biggest kind of um faults is not like I'm a control freak so I need help and and I'm getting there and I just you know you want somebody to care as much about your business as you do it's impossible to find and you know with Showtime there's CBS so they're doing all the right stuff as far as hiring and you know and bringing the right people and I didn't take that in consideration like hiring you know heart is not find good employees and people that actually care and can get the job done they mold with the team and gel with the team so it's just those kind of Dynamics not even think about and also when you're at Showtime you know for six years and we started with zero subscribers and then six years later at like 600 000 you know well known in the space we're up for awards you're starting from dead zero again so that's six years that you built for them that doesn't come with you I don't own that Showtime page that's there so you just start from zero again I think we're like 160 170 000 now a year in which isn't bad but it's you know it takes time to keep chipping away chipping away so what about uh listener like Sean and I the metrics that we know is downloads which is when we describe downloads as like Spotify YouTube and also I iTunes and all that [ __ ] what do you what's the size of your biggest show I think is fire in the kid what what size are you guys at now for that we do we look at it per episode because otherwise you can get a lot of downloads if you just pump out more and more episodes like per episode is the real real deal for I think for for these shows well see so exciting the kid and the golden hour which is formerly known as king of the Sting with Theo Von so finally kill the king of Sting even though they're on the thick boy networked those haven't changed just under my banner but those have those weren't part of showtime at all Showtime was uh below the belt which is now the shop show food truck Diaries um and some other shows and then I wasn't doing fight campaign with them that's all new so you know I would say they probably cut my audience in half you know probably in half but and what what's the fighter and the kid at five's a kid I mean now now we're going down uh you know you're going down a a different road because there's factors there that have you know cause that show like you know you want to do it for 12 years it's like this you know it's like this so you know we've been as high as 600 000 episodes as low as a hundred thousand episodes so that that and it's you know there's been some outlying factors you know that that cause those issues so each and that with the changing of King of The Sting with Theo leaving you're talking about a whole new show so you start from basically from scratch again to start with Chris Delia and Eric Griffin it's completely different show the Dynamics completely different so you're re-inducing that show to kind of although there was an audience there I think we're at 500 000 subscribers those 500 000 subscribers were there for theobada Brenda job so when you go all right well here's Brandon and crystally and Eric some people will know we'd like to dial it with Theo and Brendan so that's fairly new you know that's about six months old so you know that one's probably around 150 200 000 just on YouTube but um I think a lot of people in podcasting because it's the thing in 2023 is they look at YouTube YouTube YouTube YouTube adios King molt for the most part people listen to podcasts on their way to work or when they're at the office they'll be sitting down watching a podcast for two hours or three hours however long your podcast is the audio is K so my main metric that I focus on is always audio now if audio starts to go down we got problems yeah we're at like when we we'll have guests on every once in a while and they'll be like are you guys big and they'll just look at the YouTube and like our YouTube only gets like thirty thousand twenty thousand all the way up to 200 000 per episode but then our audio it's like consistently 100 200 000 ish or something like that like consistently every single time correct and that and that's crushing it and I'm like no it's pretty big it's just like you can't see those numbers but our our audio I mean it's like that's like as true to subscription as you can get because it's just consistently a big thing yeah adios came with this new generation of podcasters coming in you know you see the Logan Paul's or the Andrew Schultz of the world and you know Rogan was massive on YouTube but it's again and I don't know what Logan Paul's numbers are as far as audio Logan Paul's a buddy I guess I could find out but because he's a YouTuber just his numbers are massive on YouTube I'd be curious to see what his audio is like because again audio is Canyon podcasting so I never focus on YouTube too much now if there's a decline you're like all right we gotta figure this out and we'll work to it but it's my audio solid I don't you know I'm not there's no red flags what's your ambition level in terms of this business like are you are you are you thinking like I think we can get to 10 million in revenue or is it like I want to exit for 100 million I think we can get the 50 million in Revenue where do you where is like your not quite North Star but like your two three five year goal yeah that's a that's a great question um Rob Dyrdek's a good buddy and she's such I don't know yeah Rob Derek would be great for you guys we've had we've had him on and he killed it we we were I I think we were a little bit early in his like public business Persona and we had him and he blew us away he was amazing yeah I've known Rob for years so I've always knew he was just like Savant when it comes to business he makes so many great decisions and he came into the thick boy studios here in Calabasas and I was probably I don't know she's two or three months into it you know so you're still trying to figure it out and he's looking around and he's like man this is cool and he's asking all these questions they kept going you know what's your goal what's your goal watch your goal and finally I think he was even out there I'm like Dia chilled dude I was like um let me get to cruising altitude and get to Wi-Fi before I start figuring out goals like this thing's just taken off once I get to cruising altitude I'll let you know the goal so we're kind of getting to cruising altitude I I you know I don't know what the goal is I think once I get to the network where I think it could be at that I would start looking at other options but the other thing I would say too when as far as business whether it's whiskey and merge whatever it is even stand up podcasting I've never done anything for money ever I do it because I love to do it and it's fun for me and it's what I want to do and if it makes money fantastic man that's great but if it does it all good it's something I want to do so hopefully this thing goes great and makes a ton of money and I can retire when I say retire do less shows but with just more money in the bank but um I love doing it that's why I started it so so hopefully you know when we do this show in you know three years or five years I'm talking to you guys and we're celebrating some big moment but I couldn't tell you what that looks like and that might be a problem I mean you guys are the business guys is that a problem that I don't have some sort of end goal here even though so I don't think you got to have an uh and like what people want like a five year plan and you kind of taught this at a young age like you're 18 years old what you going to major in not as hot dude I don't know I don't know [ __ ] about [ __ ] yet um yeah so people are often pushing for that it's great when you have it so I always say that if you know the direction you want to go you know the outcome it's great when you have it but the reality is most people don't have it right off the Jump and that's totally normal you just got to get in motion get momentum because as you start going you'll start navigating you'll get a better vantage point it's like you start climbing the mountain you're higher up you could see more and that'll give you a little more but I do what I do think helps is a vision for your life so a vision for like which what kind of what do you want to do with your life your talents or like so for example I might not know I'm trying to hit this Revenue Target I'm trying to sell in X years or whatever but I do usually know man it'd be [ __ ] awesome if dude what if my job was I literally get to sit down with my friend Sam and we just shoot the [ __ ] about business and what if there were millions of people listening to that wouldn't that be cool yeah all right that's literally when I started this podcast it was I was walking around with a friend we had just signed the paperwork to sell my my first company and he was like what do you want to do next and in Silicon Valley where I live there's only one answer I'm gonna start another company it's gonna be bigger and badder than the one before that there's only one socially acceptable answer in Silicon Valley it's like in Hollywood if you're not trying to make it what are you doing here and so but I gave him the honest answer I go you know what I think what Tim Ferriss does is awesome it seems like that dude gets to wake up just be curious about [ __ ] run experiments learn about things and then he just takes the coolest stuff he learns he just gets to talk about it and a million people have him in in their ears and he gets to influence a million smart people by sharing little nuggets I go that would be awesome I want to be in a million people's ear balls and that's just what I kept saying I want to be in a million people's ear balls he was like dude I never even heard that word but like he goes That's a like that's like a vision for like what would be an awesome life so I I think that sometimes you don't have to have the number but it is cool to have a man that'd be awesome if my life was X or if I was able to do that do X I remember uh I remember talking to you guys know Justin Khan Justin so Sean actually sold his company to Twitch Justin Khan's one of the guys who started twitch you know they sold it for a billion dollars I I was talking to him backstage one time like two years or three years after the sale we're at uh an event I was hosting and he was like I was like what are you gonna do next Justin and he goes 10 billion I want to go after 10 billion and uh it didn't work it didn't work out for him by the way it didn't work out and like he I remember I read like this blog post where he was like I was motivated to like out and do what I did before partially out of like it was like it was like rage like out of Rage out of like a chip on my shoulder which is actually I think great fuel but like I was in it for the wrong motivations and it didn't work out but yeah something Sean has said that I said it differently but he said it better which was uh abz which is like I I like to do this all the time I'm like all right step one is a step two is B I don't need to worry about anything else in between that but step Z is like one day maybe maybe one day this becomes a billion dollar company but let's just focus on getting to a million in revenue or let's just focus on like paying the rent and then after that maybe we could hire a handful of people and then I'll figure out the rest but maybe one day it could become this and that's like a fun way to like that's like a fun North Star to like help some decision making it's also very motivational you're like I'm doing this for for this reason yeah it's also less pressure where you know I and you know I think happened that entrepreneur spirit that I was born with from my dad you guys it seems like you guys have the same thing too you have to be the success you breached uh you know I never stop and smell the roses ever it's always what's next what are we gonna do next and What Makes Us successful and this next thing the next thing and in my sports career and even in comedy I've never just stopped and you know smelled the roses I'm constantly constantly pushing constantly pushing you know I don't know if that leads to happier life you know I think sometimes you need a check and go if you're doing it's all good man if nothing changes your life's pretty freaking great man if you just stay here it's all good but I I wish I was more like that you know I I don't know what else I could get that would make me happy I guess if uh you know if I'd have to fly commercial my life would change that'd be great you know but outside that like things are going to apply private you mean yeah yeah if I didn't have to fly commercial I hate flying but well yeah hey I I see you got the nice 911s you got the cool Ferraris I mean you got the toys yeah a nice next step yeah if you had told 10 year old Brendan you know some of the stuff you'd be doing some of the stuff you'd have he'd be like holy man this is insane dude good for you you made it but I don't feel like we always talk about on the Pod we say a lot of people ask like what advice would you give your 21 year old self or your your 15 year old self and we asked the opposite questions like what would our 15 year old self say to us now if it could look at our life now be like dude you're unhappy look at your [ __ ] man like are you joking you got to barely heard you get to do this every day like you better be smiling bro like that's what that's what my teenage self would be telling me right now uh and that's almost a good reminder it's like like I always say dogs and kids got it figured out and and uh I want to be more like I want to learn more and be more like my dog and my kids because oh dude all day is play everything is good they're happy they're grateful like we get we get things screwed up when we get older and do you guys have kids I got two little ones yeah I have a seven and three year old and I don't think I've ever been this happy in my life as my two boys were yesterday I bought them two but I brought three lizards I was like man if I could just that level of Happiness one more time bearded listener one time my life is complete yeah can you give you a different perspective on things man you know I might be stressed out about work so I might come home and that stuff goes out the window you know there's nothing better than being a dad our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobbled together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better uh Tony Robbins if you ever I don't know if you've ever been to one of his events or or looked into no pissed off like most people think oh Tony Robbins I I don't need motivation or that's like a cult thing or whatever I've been to a bunch of them and I found it really really useful it's a good I don't know I'm not very religious so it's a good operating Philosophy for life but one of the things he says is he's like you got on one hand the the the sort of the the science of success and that's I think what you've kind of done done well which is whether I'm going into football or fighting or comedy or podcasting or now the business side there's the the science of success is basically like there's an approach to set you know figuring out a Target working hard every day making progress like taking it seriously all that stuff and then there's the art of fulfillment and they're unrelated and if you want to have like the full the complete life you got to figure out oh just like I learned the skills of how to be successful I got to learn the skills of how to be fulfilled and the magic happens when you sort of integrate the two can you both like create new projects and try to be successful while being fulfilled because what most people do is they go for that success thing mostly from a point of view of like um you know try to prove themselves or it's like a some some insecurity a lot of times that will drive it no I love that yeah I think uh yeah for me I do a pretty good job of trying to stop and smell the roses a little bit so I'm doing a better job my kids helped me get there and then I think a lot of mistakes that people make whether it's business entertainment you know stand up comedians is especially with social media now that's why I'm not a big social media guy is you can always compare yourself to somebody doing better so for your friend that made a billion next thing was 10 billion because he saw a guy make 10 billion so if you're constantly chasing that compare yourself to others that's where the happiness never comes so I try not to compare myself to the others especially me because my Journey's so different than those guys that I look up to so you know my Journeys can be different man whatever that looks like and I just have to accept that which I try to do Sean and I yeah I was I was reading some of the yesterday that reminded me of you and which was uh I was reading a blog post Sam put out this great tweet asking for what's the best blog post you ever read and one of them was this thing called the the uh the was it the physics of passion he basically goes uh there's this thing called the Kool-Aid point so he draws this graph he's like as you as you do [ __ ] and people start to like your work or admire you or love you or become a fan of you you'll it kind of grows steady steady steady and then there's this point uh he calls this the Kool-Aid point where it kind of takes off it goes then you're gonna have two groups of people you're gonna have a bunch of people that love you and a few people that hate you and he goes what happens is here's how you'll know you're there people accuse your fans of just drinking the Kool-Aid they love everything you do beside unseen and they're Kool-Aid drinkers that's how you know if you have people that can be described as that you've hit the Kool-Aid Point yeah I love that on the other side you're going to have people who want to tear you down are the haters you know quote unquote and uh and and you know at first they're they're always a small group but they're kind of loud and some people even support them and be like oh you're you're speaking truth to power you're you're calling it like it is you're kind of exposing this person or this this brand or whatever it is yeah and you got both and so I was reading that and I knew we had this pod today and I was like oh dude he's he's live he's lived that point because yeah so you know you have for people who don't know you got a big fan base you got a big anti-fan base and uh the anti-fan-based I think it's on on Reddit I go to this subreddit a bunch but I'm not like like it's weird I like you but I also find it funny like they're so clever these people are not so funny but they're also funny in the same way like it's kind of this this double thing I'm curious like for you obviously that's like you know it's probably funny for me because I'm outside of it I'm not the person that's the butt of the joke in some of these cases but you know me and Sam got maybe 1 100th of the like kind of the the passion and hate that you that you have because you've been doing this a long time you've you've made it pretty big but when I read our YouTube comments and I see something like that it stings in the moment but also there's a lot of times where I'm like they're not wrong like you know uh there is there is some truth where they're they're being a dick about it but there's some truth to where what they're saying I I could see that I'm curious for you when you when you hear about the the sort of the stuff on the subreddit or you check it out or whatever do you have any moments where you're like all right they're kind of being mean about it or they're being a dick about it but there's some truth to what they're saying I mean yeah I'm sure you know I don't in all honesty I I don't pay attention to it I think you it's a it's a bad thing whether you pay attention to the negativity or the positivity yeah I think you just gotta keep doing your thing you know my heroes growing up didn't live this world you know so it can't be healthy I think we'll find over years how it affects the brain how it affects creatives and businessmen with who do pay attention to that stuff and read the comments and stuff like that so I don't want to be that sample size I'm not going to be trying to get that digital CTE comments every day yeah I already have enough CT man I'm about to ride my Porsche off the PCH but um I think with the Reddit group yeah it's interesting because you know the watch everything you do and there's there's some things that I'm on board with and then the only there's a small select group on there who are just evil so there's difference between hate which I get I give you a lot to hate on I do a lot of content I make a lot of jokes I send a lot of people I get that you don't get to a certain level without giving you a lot of haters you just don't if you look at Logan Paul Drake Lebron James name some the massive celebrities that we have in this world there and you go online you read their comments or My Buddy Joe Rogan nobody no I don't know anybody gets more hate than that guy he gets more love you know I'm in the business of likability so if you watch my podcast you buy a ticket to my stand up you buy the merch you buy the whiskey you're a fan I make a living off like ability so I just don't I don't give the hate energy as far as the Reddit goes I get it and some of them are really funny and I appreciate those guys whether it's good or bad towards me it gets a little dicey when they they want to I just I don't understand when they cry when they cross the line when it gets into my personal life right it's like I'm not Tom Cruise dude why the [ __ ] you give us who cares about that stuff you know and thank God my wife she's been with me since I was in the UFC so when you're fighting UFC you get a lot of love you get a lot of hint there's no in between if you're doing it right so she's conditioned to that she doesn't pay attention to it she doesn't care you know at this point so thank God for that but the only time I don't like is when they make it super personal it's about the kids it's about you know certain things but you know nobody's harder uh on on on me than myself you know there's nothing they can say that I don't tell myself usually on a daily basis and trust me it's way worse whatever they're putting out so although I you know I get it I appreciate it and you know I just don't give it energy I think one of the things that I have going for me is you know I post and ghosts I don't pay attention to that stuff but then I'm also you know I'm on the road whatever it is 30 weekends a year I you know if I I get done this interview I go get coffee I can't go down the street without so many 10. hey Brandon love you man so that's real that's what I care about social media it's a factor for sure but it's not the end-all be-all I think when people realize that that one in if you're walking down the street one to ten people on social media especially on Twitter that you can't give yourself value your self-worth of what social media is you're going to live a much happier life so that Reddit group they're gonna do their thing you know and that comes with their territory and I was built for that's why God give me big shoulders but um you know they're gonna click that they're gonna love that one yeah I think I was built for it and then also you look you know if you look at me I know you know I probably look like the guy that bored you in high school they needle to use some of that you know like oh Brendan's a bully or whatever and I know I look like the guy but if they actually knew me know these people know me they've never met me you know they're not buying tickets to the show so I don't give it energy because if I did I wouldn't have a business I wouldn't have this house that I'm talking to you guys in right now so um you know I think it it get the lines get blurred where it's like oh he's a big strong guy he's fighting here see he can handle this we there's no limits everything's on off limits he there's nothing off limits we can go as hard as we want him it's like it actually hurts my feelings man it's actually not cool you know but I joked I'm all for I'm all four man I'm professional comic we roast each other we do our thing so if it's funny it's witty fire away but when you start going towards the once once you start going towards the personal side well then you've crossed the boundary you know and now also if you want to have this conversation in person you want to offend me we can do that I can do that we can see how it goes for you that's never happened as long as long as I've been in entertainment I've never run into anybody that said something to my face so I just I get what they're doing if it's funny it's witty and they're gonna do their thing I actually appreciate it but when you cross the boundary and you did you disrespect me a different way you know that that's where I have an issue with it what is the issue with it means it hurts my feelings I'm not gonna do nothing dude I'm not gonna beat I'm not the bully you expect me to be and then also I think that that subreddit has crossed the point not all of them some are actually just funny and they're fans and they just show it in a different way and I understand that at my age but you know a lot of them have crossed that boundary where you know they hide behind this gboard and they want to do evil things which I just I don't understand that's to me it's like and for why for what because I do stand up you don't have to buy a ticket because I do free podcasts that triggers you right we don't have to watch you know so I just I'm just cut from a Different Cloth I'm just a positive person now there's some podcasters that will lean into it and if there's beef between Comics the lean into that and they like that that controversy and that drama all the time like it's real housewives of LA and I would probably be much more famous than much more further along my career if I entertained that I just can't do it sometimes I think man I should try that it's just not what I do I don't like being negative I'm a positive person I enjoy helping people out so you know it's just heavy lies to Crown with that stuff man you were you were saying how when you moved there's a lot of rent I apologize no it's good they're a whole you know someone's got a clip that some hater will clip that hopefully but somehow hopefully that hate pushes us forward somehow but you were talking about moving to LA and how that was like a big change you basically like Sean and I both lived in San Francisco when we started internet companies and like having a crew we were in each other's crew we had a handful of others where you like succeed together that's like the greatest thing ever because like it's it's hey it's fun and B is actually useful like you piggyback off each other and you and you motivate one another and you actually like you invest in each other whatever it's like practical you're in this cool world it's like you Bobby Lee Theo Von crystalia Andrew Santino uh Andrew Schultz is a little bit outside of that but somewhat inside of that Joe Rogan yeah you got this like crew and like it doesn't like 10 years ago you know there was Rogan but there weren't really like a lot of like comedy YouTube channels like or podcasts but right now like if I go on my YouTube app like it's basically like a Theo Bond or Brennan job clip like constantly or like the clip of Bobby Lee tell the story about uh uh that's gonna be the most viral clip in uh comedy podcast history that was hilarious yeah it's so funny where he talks about getting molested by a Down Syndrome guy it's one of the funniest I mean and so like I can't go on without seeing like a funniest bits from whatever like and it's like someone in your crew what's that like behind the scenes like are you guys uh is this like a um like Sean and I sometimes when we want to get like popular on X Y and Z we're like hey can you like this can you share this or hey do you want my thing you come like it's like it's it's somewhat organized somewhat or just sharing like we're just sharing being like yo I'm doing this and it's working like uh yes you know um what's that like you know what you have like a group text when you're like hey Theo like uh I found that like this type of like because you guys and then by the way I don't know if we told you this if you go and look at when we first started MFM my first million we just bought the same [ __ ] red sofa lounge chairs that you had because I love it because I would see those on the I would see those in the thumbnail and I'm like yeah all that red like you make it makes you want to click it and I noticed that you and Theo particularly you I bet you probably started it you have these like pretty eye-catching Studios they're not like particularly fancy but they're just like they're just like an eye-catching and you're changing them constantly and I've noticed Theo's does the same thing he's constantly changing the set same with Andrew Schultz are you guys like sharing all these tactics like uh when we're doing this it's working or like here's how much we're paying for it blank or like you guys let's pump each other around this thing yeah you know so going back to kind of the the whole like kind of it was almost like a team you know and I you know the team captain all this starts from Joe Rogan so before I hit the comment but he doesn't give a [ __ ] about any of that does he he just does whatever the [ __ ] he wants in it sometimes it works he does whatever he wants and he's the leader of the pack but he's also the reason why we Embrace each other and you know five six years ago seven years ago at the comedy store is the comedy wrap pack and we were the we were the Rat Pack and we were the guys and every show sold out our names on the Marquee and Rogan there was a there was kind of uh you know their structure like we don't tear each other down we support each other um and I heard Isaiah Thomas say this when he went on uh my uh boys podcast uh all the smoke with Matt Barnes um and uh Isaiah Thomas said this and it really resonated with me he was on there he's talking about Michael Jordan and he goes and clearly I'm not a black man I don't know if you guys know this or not but I'm not black but it's actually not that clear by the way you could be you could who knows what I am dude if you told me you had a little in you it wouldn't be surprising yeah earlier when you said uh Denver or Buffalo Bills didn't want slow white guys I was like yeah so you're in yeah so you made the team right yeah right now tell me you're not Aaron Hernandez no but um so uh where was I oh so we're this coming Rat Pack no no you're saying Isaiah Thomas said something yeah Isaiah Thomas yeah so Isaiah Thomas said this and I saw a clip that Matt Barnes post and I love those guys I started with them at showtime and they're crushing it but Isaiah Thomas they brought up Michael Jordan and Isaiah Thomas has issues with Michael Jordan and uh Matt Barnesville we'd love to have them on and uh Isaiah's like it's a tough one he does do interviews then Isaiah said as an alumni from the NBA as as alumni and you guys are alumni we're this tight fraternity and not only are a tight fraternity that we've reached certain levels of the MBA in this you know in this Lane that we're in but we're also black men and it is our duty to support each other it is our duty to come on the shows and make sure you guys get views make sure people get your name out there that that is something that has it's our responsibility being in this small group in this small club and back probably seven years ago you know Rogan it was the same thing it is your [ __ ] it is your duty to come on other shows to broaden the audience to bring everybody into these great talents you know whether it's you know back in the day find the kid outside Joe Rogan fine kid was the wanting pad if he goes through it you look at Tim dill and Andrew Schultz centino Theo Von Crystal it you look at all the people that came on there and just exploded now is it because it the final kid audience maybe helped a little it's because those guys are so goddamn talented and once people saw who they were they out succeeded finding the kid they've gone on they've blown the roof off things now but if you look back on finding the kid and I take so much pride and joy in that where we have these guys on before they are massive and as Isaiah Thomas says it is our duty to do that so that resonated with me now this is seven eight years ago uh even 10 years ago when five kids first started out we'd have all these comments on stuff like that and then the pandemic hits the the pandemic hit and the leader of the Rat Pack leaves Joe Rogan leaves and the comic store shuts down comedy La shuts down then comes the girl leaves and then Joey Diaz leaves then Tim Dillon leaves the deal Von leaves and then uh Brian goes through some [ __ ] me too movement and he has to leave and kristalia goes some through some [ __ ] me too moving Chrisley has to leave and I'm on this island by myself I'm like whoa where's everybody I thought let's all right the troops although we're not in La we got a rally let's rally around each other and it broke my heart man it broke my that no those days are over Dude you gotta figure it out on your own those days are over the days of you know being in the in in the hallways at the Conway store in The Improv and the ice house and Laugh Factory where you know hey podcast tomorrow yeah podcast one those days are gone everyone's they've made it everyone's in their game you gotta figure it out on your own now it's weird because you know I was like Comedy Store last night and I always have this uh it takes me a while I sit in the parking lot for a while because it just kind of reminds me when I pull up now that I used to pull up and Rogue and pull up in this Porsche and park next to each other and talk shop about the cars and what's next and then Santino would pull up and we talked to him and Chris D'Elia and then Brian would pull up and Bobby Lee and Theo and we'd be in there and they're going to college it was the best it was it was the absolute best and I wish five six seven years ago somebody would have tapped us on the show like hey fellas in two years this is all God you I didn't realize at the moment that that was the Golden Age and what we were doing was so special we took it for granted and I I didn't realize at the time how special it was in in my in my theater where my fish tank are and like my man cave I have four pictures from those days but I just put them up right you know when they were done five six seven years ago I didn't realize that in that picture in that Frozen moment that was the best time ever for for me as far as uh just being in that symbiotic like team it was such a team man yeah there's a special moment you know now we're all everyone's doing well we still talk we have our group chats but as far as like you know seeing each other all the time like those days are over man and it's heartbreaking yeah it's it's important to have one of those like uh Pay It Forward cultures because it's like that I think silica Valley has that too which which is there's not really that much gatekeeping you can go to the most successful richest guy in Silicon Valley he'll give give you time it doesn't matter who you are and if you need a favor they'll give you a favor with they'll give you either advice or money or an intro and there's no like pay it back it's all paid for because they got helped by the person before them and correctly that stayed together now like you said with the pandemic a bunch of people moved out of Silicon Valley so who knows what will happen now it takes a little longer in our world to to sort of see those effects but I remember when I was in San Francisco living in San Francisco kind of on the come up me and Sam met doing one of these like founder masterminds where we would get dinner for hours and talk like okay what are you doing how's that going what am I doing how's that going how can we help each other out and it felt like um you know in Toy Story when when they go to that arcade and those little minions are are in the machine and it's like the claw and the cloth selects one and takes it away and that's like you you know they made it they they got the fame the fortune they got picked but the other minions weren't pulling them down they were like pushing them up like his Grand brother go for it you know like you know you you made it out and because it's like that in Silicon Valley you'll know somebody and they're broke for the four years you know them and then they're worth 150 million dollars overnight and then you're like yo the claw picked you and you won yeah yeah the claw which is Mark Zuckerberg buying your company happened uh and like it's same thing in entertainment someone hits a breakout point and now they're famous they're you know they made it and there's a question of like does it do you just get left in the dust do you resent people when they're happening or do you you realize that the rising tide lifts all boats and you really want to be in that Rising tide type of yeah in in just a side note in San Francisco now pay it forward yeah great you gotta worry about getting stabbed out there forget starting tonight will your friend watch it back watch your back literally like you got you gotta actually watch each other's back physically just survive the day you know Reina Ford is carrying a gun so your buddy even gets stabbed in the net yeah it's insane you uh I was gonna ask a slightly different question but you I saw a few interviews that were cool one it was uh Donald cowboy Cerrone and then Chael Sonnen and I think actually Michael Bisping said the same thing where they were talking about like in the locker room before they fight and they're like I think it was chill he's like people think that like we're tough guys and like maybe we we kind of are but like every single time before a fight I think my last one should have been my last one what am I doing I hate this and then like Michael bisbing who's like a cocky dude and like is very confident he was like this is the worst thing ever and then I think cowboy Cerrone was like I throw up before every fight I'm so afraid and then you had a really cool thing where you're like I just beat up uh Crow cop so if you don't listen if you don't know anything about UFC Crow cop is like one of the the goats of MMA and he's scary as [ __ ] like he's like this Croatian dude but like you think he's like a scary Russian RoboCop type of guy and you knocked him out and I remember like you said you're like I knocked him out and backstage I went and said like thank you or something or like you know like a good fight and he like had ice on his head and you're like what the [ __ ] am I doing I don't want to like do this for my life I don't want to be 40 or 38 or however old he was when you when you beat him up but uh what's that like backstage the 15 30 minutes before you're about to go fight to the death in your underwear in front of a million people yeah I think I don't I don't know if I was the I might have been the one the first fighters ever say that you know but a lot of guys they want to give off the Persona that oh were these Warriors It's Like Gladiator we can't wait to get out there but I'm telling you so and I won't mention names I've seen dudes cry backstage they don't want to go out there I've seen their coaches slap them like dude you have to go out there it's just I I just don't think it's natural you know I think it's a level of intelligence of your body and your mind going hey you're about to get hurt do not go out there so the anxiety is through the roof and every fight I was like what am I doing man I was like so disappointing myself and then once I hit the cage for most of my career I was okay I knew it was time to get out when I hit the cage and my dude don't get hurt get out of here you got so much more to do in this life you cannot you know suffer a concussion we have got to figure this out so you know I think there's truth and honesty for most Fighters where it's like it's terrifying it's to me it was the worst gig in the world there's some the highs are the highest in the world the Peaks are the best the valleys are the lowest there can be in professional sports or maybe in life it's a tough gig man you know so I think the more Fighters talk about like Hey we're human man and and it is scary going out there and I think the more Fighters talk about the more people can relate to it because most people have you ever man if if tonight you're today after this the podcast you go to the coffee shop and you're getting your coffee and some guy goes you have some altercation the guy goes hey man tomorrow at 1pm you and I are fighting you're like I guess we gotta fight imagine the anxiety you can have that night that morning walk in that coffee shop and that's fighting Billy you know from in San Francisco who's gonna you know and fight you over coffee and he probably don't have skills now height net times a thousand not only do you know exactly when you're getting a fisticuff if the guy happens to be I don't know top 10 the world at beating people up in your underwear and everybody's gonna see it you know what I'm saying it's human nature to be like this is not healthy dude we've been we this dude this podcast and just our friends it's been cool to like see some of our friends become worth hundreds of millions or even billion dollars and it's cool because we'll talk to them like just hanging out and they'll be like I have to fire this person and I'm so afraid to do it like I that I haven't done it in like eight months like I'm afraid of the confrontation and what that does is it like normalizes fear and you're like oh therefore I can do it and I remember like thinking about like Habib and like dude this guy is like Terminator like he doesn't show that much fear and then I saw some of these other tough guys like say like oh no like it's it's miserable I've always wanted like a Conor or a Habib like some of the the the most outspoken confident guys I like I want to hear them say like I'm about to piss my pants because whenever I hear that I'm like that's [ __ ] cold I could do anything if this guy's afraid if this guy's afraid which I know they are even if they don't say it I know they are I think there are levels to like it does seem like there are some guys like a Habib or something like that where they're like they're more stoic than others but there is like there's always self-doubt and I think it's really cool when I see some of these killers like actually say that it gives me like it oddly gives me hope yeah I think it makes them human I you know I think it would do athletes just so much more in the public eye if you know before the Super Bowl or even after super autonomy like I'm scared shitless man that defense was good you know I'm terrified to get hit and throw interceptions and fail I just think more people would relate to it because whatever were there ever any athletes that you know of or hung out with MMA guys or boxers where they were built different where they're like this person's looking forward to a fight or do you think unilaterally it was no there's there's people where you know ignorance is bliss right you know it's like there there's guys I trained with and I I'd be two weeks out from the fight you know in the camps tailoring down I'm like oh man the fight's in two weeks man Saturdays but you guys are good no exciting right I'm like no do this is terrible but dates just there's certain guys where they live for you know those guys like the the Diaz brothers even though they said that they hate fighting I think there's some guy like a Kane Velasquez there's certain guys that just thrive in that just engage you who they just they just love the violence they just there's nothing they were just born Warriors you know they're not thinking about businesses or you know uh 10 years down the road or 15 years down the road it's just they were meant to do this and God bless them you need people like that God bless them even if you're not in the UFC if you're listening to this go and look up Justin Gacy post fight Michael Chandler on YouTube he said this amazing thing he goes I was born in the wrong era I should have been a gladiator so I could kill this person in front of all of you because that's what I'm built to do and that's what I love I'm here to fight to the death and I heard that and I'm like there's there's two different types of humans I'm one and he's the other yeah this is crazy true and I think you know I I think for me it came to realization because I've known Justin gaichi since she was in college I used to go up to University of Northern Colorado and wrestle to get ready for my USC fight so I saw just at a young age he's always been like that and again when I'd be in the locker rooms or we'd be in the training camps and those guys would talk like that you know don't get me wrong I'm built like a warrior like uh you'd look at me I think that's one of the reasons I get paid from these guys I think it's okay to treat me the way that I that they do because you know I look like a gladiator I'm this big dude with tattoos and cauliflower ears but really push come to shove I'm the guy behind going to feel like I don't want to be in the front [ __ ] lines man that's not what I want to do you know so so I get the treatment of these Warriors but really I'm the guy in the back playing the trombone holding the flag you know making sure I look good one of our Sean and I talked about this after a rose named Eunice this uh uh UFC fighter she uh like before the fight you see her saying I'm the best I'm the best I'm the best and it doesn't matter if you like UFC or not it makes you cry because you're just like there's so much like you have to talk yourself up to this and it's just so like motivational inspiring cute I don't know what you want to call it but it's awesome it's like one of my favorite moments of seeing her say that and then afterwards Joe goes I saw you saying you're the best what's up with that and she goes because I am the best and you like you're convincing herself yeah that she's the best so much self-doubt and he's just like no you're the best and because and I'm assuming she worked with a mental coach which I did too when I was fighting you work with these high-level Mentor coaches they tell you that you fight the negative thought in your head with a positive you say it out loud so that's just for freaking trying to keep the the demons at the door good I'm the best I'm the best you know what I love about this podcast is usually when people bring up fighting and for me it's a nightmare it's that nightmare like especially if I if I'm doing a a show outside like whether it's a comedy central if it's a TV show they talk fighting usually they have no clue about UFC like even you brought up Rose you brought up Justin gaichi and the Michael Chandler stuff like thank God you guys have an insight into the UFC like current UFC World I'll give you some shows and be like so what's your take on chuckled down for and Tank Abbott I think that's still gonna happen dude they have Alzheimer's man they're not having it anymore how is Conrad McGregor doing no man we're super fans that's why uh that's why it's cool to hang out with you we've had we've talked I've talked to Michael Bisping been asking we've had Ariel helwani on your voice I know you guys had uh you guys had a spat uh we've had uh who else uh a bunch of people in that world it's always fun to talk to you guys because like even though like the intensity level that you're doing it's like literally life and death starting a business is like a percentage of that but it's like I can't do this I'm freaking out I don't know how to do this like you constantly feel like inferior oh there's similarities with all of it with all of it whether you're a UFC fighter your entrepreneur there's similarities where you bake on yourself it's on you and the peaks of valleys are insane either way so there's takeaways from both sides you know there's they definitely overlap you know you mentioned Arrow Hawaii right and I there's that and I think it's a fan thing you know I've had spats with over the years it's gonna happen I don't really entertain it but I have no animosity towards Ariel you know I'll do interviews whether whatever it is going to go so you and Dana don't like each other no I have no animal I I don't dislike anybody you know I think that might be one of the reasons too why the haters they can't stand it because they they want that they want that drama they want something to feed off of they call it feeding the trolls I just don't entertain that I think that is you know upsets them it's just not what I do so when Aaron and I were having our thing man I made a mistake I was on the fight campaign I said some things I shouldn't have said he was rightfully slowly get upset and did his thing all good man that's how it goes you know I take your accountability there that's on me but here is the best journalist we have I listen to a show you know I have no issues with Ariel with Dana man if anything I probably should be giving data 10 because when he made that deal with Reebok it you know at the time I was a young man at the time I took it personal I thought it was a hit of against me and it put a chip on my when I say chip out of entire Pringles and what you're talking about is uh before you could put any logo you want then you made a deal with Reebok and it's just they are the guys yeah I lost you know probably a hundred thousand dollars a fight and you know and I took it personal but being a business owner now Dana was at mate when the Reebok deal came man how's this going to affect Brendan Shaw no dude I'm one of the you know I'm one of the elephants in the circus you gotta do what's great for all the elephants not just me so I was you know a bystander and the casualty of that deal just didn't work out in my favor but that pushed me faster into what I was supposed to be doing so Damon actually helped me out I have zero issue with Dana huge fan huge fan but I think fans some people for whatever reason they can't get over that it's like well no he screwed you over and look and you have to retire and he did this I'm like no he did me a favor guys that was 12 years ago it's all good he's doing great he's worth more money than God I'm doing pretty good at zero if he called me today I was like hey man we need you to do this no doubt I'll help you out no problem well dude you're the man you um I said earlier that we had Rob on and he like I knew Rob grown up as a skater and then he came on and he like just surprised us so much I think his his video has uh hundreds of thousands of views that when we did with him which is good for us and uh you're kind of in that category where you're where I'm like I had good expectations uh because I listened to you a lot but you're a lot more insightful than I thought and I thought you were pretty insightful and and you're you're just a good guess maybe next time you'll have a better uh setup instead of just being on your iPhone yeah yeah so here here's the thing about that so I don't own a computer my company like thick Boy network has whatever 12 15 computers um I'm like that anti um I'm the anti kind of Technology guy I don't like it seems that seems good for a internet company owner I know right Mark yeah can you tell I'm gonna fail by next year so yeah we did the same with uh there's a guy Mark Laurie who bought the Timberwolves he he's a like famous entrepreneur he's a billionaire he came on he was doing the same thing he's like is this good guys they put his iPhone on a chair on top of his dining table and he stood up and he talked and we were like do you can you use your computer I don't I don't own a computer and we were like it hits different when a billionaire says it it's like you know if somebody else says it you're just like man what a schmuck and then you hear him say you're like this guy knows this guy knows how to live okay he's got a person you know he's got people you know what I'm saying he's like I don't have computers but I have humans yeah no I I know you guys next time we do this I'll do an athlete boy Studios usually every Wednesday I'm in studio but uh today because um yesterday I did three podcasts in a row that a two-hour meeting for this new project I'm doing so I start at 7 30 a.m and then by the time I got done with that meeting I was I was home around five went and bought my kids lizards put fed them dinner went put them to bed then rushed Over The Comedy Store and I got home at 12 30 last night so today is my first off day and I don't know how long and then tomorrow I'm on tour in Atlanta Thursday Friday Saturday I'm in Atlanta doing shows so usually I'm always in studio and I have the team set up so it looks professional so I owe you guys I owe you guys but I I hate electric cars I think they're a disaster I don't like electric cars I don't like iPhones I'm about to switch to a flip phone I just I don't I just don't subscribe drive to it man I don't think it's healthy let's add a couple zeros to your net worth and then we'll call it cool but until then look like a tool right now you're a [ __ ] caveman you're a caveman but like maybe maybe just I've done a few zeros and we'll call you a genius but until then you're you're Neanderthal yeah yeah until then I'm just this broke guy doing a lot of iPhone step well dude thank you for doing this you're amazing and we and we we appreciate it thanks for coming on yeah besides my setup this got sad fast at the end um all right that's the episode [Music] foreign [Music]

Nike did This brilliant thing they created a shell company in Bermuda and the shell company in Bermuda owned the swoosh like the trademark to the Nike check and then what happened is company in the United States is selling shoes and it might rack up let's say 10 billion dollars of Revenue Well normally they just have to pay the tax on the 10 billion well what they would do is the swoosh company in Bermuda would then charge them 9 billion in royalty payments saying hey you're using the swoosh you got to pay us for that so all of a sudden the taxable income in the U.S goes from 10 down to one and now they just pay the 20 on the 1 billion and the 9 billion that the Bermuda company got pays a tax rate of 0

hundreds of hours of like TV that's Fixer-Upper content cooking content gardening content like all the like house [ __ ] right and now they've built this Empire the the kind of the bottom line of the the headline of the story is this couple in a in a span of about 10 years has built a billion dollar brand around themselves so it's that big it's that big [Music] laughs all right I hope they keep in what just happened so before we hit record it's like five four three two one and Sam on three takes out a drink out of nowhere at three seconds left and just chugs it like tilts up not only just tilt it up squeezes the bottle like it's a it's a Kool-Aid or like a Capri Sun or something and these trucks some carbonated drink and then it goes to one and then he puts up the one symbol like hold on look to the side burps flexes re-centers himself and is ready for the bypass that was Elite that was an elite preps for a podcast dude I'm on top of it I drank so many beverages in uh we had this Fast Company article written about uh the Hampton lunch and the reporter in like the first paragraph called about how I left the interview to grab a root beer and I came back yeah he skimmed the foam off the root beer like it was a Guinness and then finished it held up the one second sign to my lips tell me to shush as he uh as he drained during the interview you know how men drink like ipas that crap and then they look at the class after they take a drink and try to analyze it that's basically what I do with my Coke Zero dude you should you gotta have more weird quirks because like you can't really be a billionaire founder if you're not super weird so you know you got to start picking up some things like you know oh he only wears you know uh open-toed sandals with socks and like you know he wears uh shorts with you know EMF protection on his pockets because he's worried about radiation and what are the other weird things that you can do well I had a I had carbonated water on tap for a while that was pretty awesome uh like I I like only drink carbonated water no normal water oh do you have sleeps during full moons do you have uh you don't have any eccentricities do you no that's why I'm broke dude I need I need some of these before you know otherwise uh how could I be how can I be the weird Rich billionaire I'm trying to be we have uh Sean and I have these friends I won't name who they are but they're they're young guys and the minute that they got like a mild amount of success like maybe 500 000 in Revenue they clearly had read like naval's book on like charging by time or something like that and then they sent all of their clients to client services business saying we don't do meetings anymore and uh that they were leading into that eccentricity thing and I wanted to tell them you guys are doing great but you're not there yet and that's the biggest customer dropped them immediately yeah it was like oh yeah well we kind of needed to meet to talk about the I get okay well I guess we'll just find another vendor yeah I want to tell him like it's great I love the attitude you know showed up to meetings with the shirt off and it was just like well that's cool it's one way it's one way to wear your shirt that that that's not the way that that particular client was willing to do it so it's no longer their client but that is our way yeah that is definitely they do have a nipple policy unfortunately yeah they're not on board with the free the nip campaign unfortunately yeah oh we forgot to shout out we're doing a live pod April 29th that's a Saturday if

Joanna Gaines on there today and I went to Waco this weekend where they are from oh no way and like saw some of their houses yeah that's crazy okay so you might know more about this than I do okay so let me tee it up and then you tell me what you know about these people so here's my my trail of events and uh I'll put the disclaimer out there right now if you actually know about them that this is gonna all sound very Elementary this is gonna sound very very beginner because I was a complete beginner about like who are these people for their listener though Sean doesn't know like I I told him what Coldplay was last week like he didn't know he thought that was like baseball in the winter time he didn't know anything about like pop culture so this is you learning out loud yeah exactly like uh I still use a flip phone so I I would I left my house I go to Target and inside Target there's this one section that my wife always goes into and it's the only section in Target that looks like this where there's a giant picture of this happy white couple and it's their names like it's like oh here's aisle one two three four five chip and Joanna Gaines six seven eight nine say why do they have their own section so I noticed that first and I thought hmm that's interesting are these YouTubers what what is the who are these people is this the owner of Target what is this and so I noticed that and filed that away then I was talking to aldone who came on the Pod uh or we talked about it on the Pod who runs Missouri Star Quilt Company the big Quilt Company a huge quilt company and he did this thing where he started buying up a section of a town he basically bought a town and started to build it out he wanted to make it like you know quilt heaven so basically a mecca for where Quilters would go as like a as a pilgrimage to go and just like really indulge in their Hobby and he told me world for grandmas Disney World for yeah for your auntie so so he was like all right well he goes I go does anybody else do this and he goes well there's there's chip and Joanna Gaines thing in Waco and I go there they are again who are these people and you know fool me once shame on me and film me twice shame on me finally I'll look you up and I looked him up and they got an incredible story it sounds like you're pretty familiar with them but um he had told me one thing that kind of like caught my attention he goes it's it shocks me by the way you don't know about these people I mean like in the Midwest and amongst like moms like you're so California that you don't know about this they've been in the game for like 10 years uh but I don't know too much about them yeah it's you know it's it's quaint but um I I I I looked him up they the YouTube videos are amazing by the way if you if you've watched YouTube videos so they own a part of town in Waco that they've just branded as their own they bought these two abandoned I think silos like grain silos and so they called it like whatever siloville or whatever and they have The Silo abrasion at the end of the year where it's just like this is a huge party for themselves so their brand Magnolia is the like everywhere in this little area so they have the Magnolia Market where you go buy your stuff and then they have their Magnolia Table Restaurant which is served by the vegetables from Joanna's garden and then there's the Magnolia other thing and then there's a magnolia other thing and it's just all them and they get about 2 million visitors a year just coming and making the pilgrimage to Waco Texas which is really the middle of nowhere for Texas I lived in Texas and I never went to Waco like it was not even in my top 10 places to go in Texas and so they have made Waco a destination they literally have raised the housing prices in that area by like 24 because they have made it an attraction and their story is kind of interesting I don't know if you know their their backstory do you know do you know pretty well I don't so they uh the story goes something like this and again I'm a beginner so I'm doing the thing where you read the press release and you're like oh that's how they met how how fortunate or you know like when you hear about somebody saying like how'd you think of the idea it's like well I saw a single mother struggling and I just decided that that would be my mission it's like no dude you read a report that said this Market was growing and that's why you you know you started this business but like here's the pr version of their story uh they live in Waco Texas chip the guy goes into this uh car repair shop that her dad owns sees a picture of her on the wall and decides I'm gonna marry that girl suspicious but okay uh keeps going back to the car repair shop yes that that story it could it could go a different route it just totally it's like uh it's like when you whispered someone's ear like I see you versus like write it on their mirror when they're in the shower you know what I mean like it text matters here the editing of the story really makes it a makes it okay but it could go either way it doesn't end up in a freezer um so yeah so he keeps going back and he eventually bumps into her ask her out on a date they go on a date uh whatever they end up getting together this is back in like 2003-ish and so he was doing house flipping and she was kind of like I guess like working with the doing like commercials for her dad's car car repair place or whatever and they get together and they decide um they they don't have anything to their name but they decide to try to try to make something of this house flipping thing she's like oh I could use my design sense you're a contractor and let's uh so they move into this like 800 square foot house and they renovate it while they live there end up flipping one flipping two flipping through they start to you know successfully flip some houses and Waco but still no big deal is that a TV show from HGTV starts casting and they read about the this husband and wife house flipper in uh in Waco Texas they said well wake up we're kind of hoping for somebody in L.A or New York or maybe Atlanta or something like that but like okay whatever let's go down to Waco and meet him and uh and he's got this like kind of big personality he's real outgoing and she's really good looking and so it like plays well for TV so they get their show on HGTV called Fixer-Upper and basically the show like from day one is a hit and so they go from kind of husband and wife Small Time house flippers like very small houses that they're flipping in Waco to now on TV um and they they're doing this and they do five or six seasons they become very famous on on HGTV show gets canceled but what they did was they had built this uh this following and they had built they had this brand in mind that they're called Magnolia like they had opened up a retail store back in the day they closed it because it wasn't really going so well but they had this idea for this store called Magnolia so when the show ends they do two things they reopen Magnolia as a beautiful place in Waco and then secondly they go to the the just the Channel Discovery Channel and they go and their TV show got canceled but but Discovery gives them a whole network discovery's like yo we're gonna make the Magnolia Network all around you guys and you guys are going to create like hundreds of hours of like TV that's Fixer-Upper content cooking content gardening content like all the like house [ __ ] right and now they've built this Empire the the kind of the bottom line of the whole the the headline of the story is this couple in a span of about 10 years has built a billion dollar brand around themselves so it's that big it's that big so there's no real numbers that like have come out so like if you go look for their net worth or their revenue super Hush Hush which you know just makes those little hairs on my arms start to tingle a little bit I know I know when it's that Hush Hush that that means it's a lot bigger than you think especially because you see it like Target partnered with them to develop that line of goods in their store so like when Target it's not even like they got their brand into Target it's like Target came to them it's like let's make a brand that's like a big deal they have pillars move in silence Killers move in silence and you hear yeah so if you don't hear about it if you don't hear about it in TechCrunch you know it's doing good I thought you were gonna hit him with a G's and lasagna type of line type of no no not well you know I I think I've uh I've milked that one dry dude it's like my mom when she was on the phone with like a customer service person and here you're like a as an apple b as in Bob whatever she goes K is a knife I just lost it I was like I don't think you understand how that works yeah it's like it's hilarious okay so they they operate like K is a knife um I grew up on this street called Simpson and I would be like uh I'd be like you know my address is this is this Simpson like O.J Simpson and uh it works um anyways their their app that has their TV show network has like tens of thousands of reviews on it so that means that that app is doing pretty well and that's a paid that's like their own version of Netflix right like that's like kind of stunning you never really see an influencer that has their own whole subscription Network and so they have the cookbooks journals retail stores brand uh paint brand uh furniture brand uh they have their TV show Network they got everything and this idea and they have their own town which gets two million visitors a year like if your website gets two million visitors a year they're doing pretty okay you're right you're you're out there let alone two million people making the pilgrimage to your small town in Waco to come buy [ __ ] from your stores that's kind of impressive I guarantee you that these people will end up billionaires off of this Magnolia brand this Magnolia brand has to be worth High hundreds of millions if not over a billion dollars already have you been to Waco ever no dude so I went to Waco this weekend because and I'll tell a quick story then we'll get back to this but basically uh last year I I randomly came across this guy who had this new Airbnb it was basically a piece of land that he built a lake on and he puts and he built seven airbnbs I was so curious I couldn't find them on social media I call them up yeah he built a lake like it was like uh like a plot of land and they built not a huge like more more a pond is a better is a better way to describe it but but it's it's a lake I guess but I call them up and I go tell me your story goes well I had a part I was an accountant I had my own small business for accounting I just built this Airbnb thing I think it's going to be really successful but I really described myself as an artist I love to paint and play music and right right away I'm like I'm in do you want to hang out start hanging out with them he's part of this thing I mentioned it called Homestead Heritage it's this religion slash Community they it's like all different parts of Christianity in it and they believe in like sustainability and and the weird part is they believe in craftsmanship so the way that they like find God Is by like doing things with their hand and doing doing it well so anyway this weekend I went and celebrated Easter at his church and like they like had a whole same thing around for a long time or did this it was like a recently created religion okay basically the story is is that one of the the main guy which is his wife's grandpa I believe uh her the wife's Isaac's uh wife's grandfather lived in New York was atheists found God somehow and felt like the best way to like show that I love God is to like just be excellent to everything I do and be kind to people among other things but that was basically it for some reason they moved to Waco they get 500 acres and they build a whole community on there and then this guy Isaac now has built this Airbnb a few miles away and he tweeted out his profits in his first year business he did a million in profit and so I went and I became friends with them and I went and hung out there and I drove through all all through Waco and basically in Waco Waco's sorry Waco people it's not nice uh it's not it's not it's it's like objectively like a fairly run down place as if maybe it was like an oil Town it feels like there was once something there and then now it's not and when you drive through that area you see like not nice house not nice house nice house and I told him that and he goes oh yeah that's the chip in Joanna's house like they like started here remodeling homes and you could distinctly tell which one is their brand and it's and and so like it's like basically like Isaac French who like brings in all these people and Chip and Joanne like you know way above him but that's like my understanding of Waco at the moment yeah there's these like uh these these like kind of Simplicity based um communities or religions or or uh cultures where it's like like I'm on their homepage right now it says Homestay Heritage is an agrarian craft-based intentional Christian Community it stresses Simplicity sustainability self-sufficiency service and quality craftsmanship and then there's literally like a video of a cow eating leaves and then like a boy stitching a baseball himself yeah I say I never did well I was like uh Isaac showed me around he goes here let me show you the orchard I planted last week you know and it's like it has 200 apple trees he's like we did this for the community anyone could come take an apple it'll be ready in like five years and that's what he does instead of watching TV so if I like I'll be like hey have you seen this movie he's like no I don't really watch movies and I'm planting trees not a whole lot of my first million podcast listeners out there probably there were a few I think there was a few but you know they're more fans of like Johnny Appleseed than Sean Perry yeah you know what I mean like uh they're they're done like Johnny apples like posters in their room yeah but uh and dude when I so I've sold the story many times I used to work for Mike Wolf from American Pickers and that was where I first learned about like entertainment and business and things like that but Mike Wolf was American Pickers at the time was like the second most popular show on TV when I worked there number one was Pawn Stars and like number four was David Letterman like to give you an idea and and we I know for real that's the that was the real rankings and then I would be at the store and some days we would sell thirty thousand dollars of t-shirts at the store and these like were not nice T-shirts they were just normal like with the logo on it we would sell like 10 grand worth of mugs and so like these shows kill it and what Mike did was he would film himself basically the show was he would drive to Barnes find old stuff tell you the history about it buy it and then sell it and he would uh he spent like four years driving around with a video camera filming this trying to pitch it and then when he finally did Pitch it he got the production rights or I guess he kind of like what Rob Dyrdek did I think that's where the money is and it sounds like that's what Magnolia did too yeah exactly the the I mean the the breadth of this Empire is is kind of stunning to me right it's like uh whether it's Home Goods it's a restaurant it's coffee books it's the it's the uh the bakery it's the TV Show Network it's the target line it's like and and their brand is like they're this relatable you know Blue Collar you know salt of the earth people it's like yeah like they are but they also have some part of them that's Rupert Murdoch and they're right they are flexing that Rupert Murdoch over the last you know 10 years I wonder if they have like a manager or if they're just doing this all in themselves like Rupert Murdoch in Wrangler jeans you know like it's we're relatable but we'll gut your heart out if we had to right if succession was in denim yeah uh no I dig these I dig these people the worst thing that would happen to them is a Johnny K plus eight remember Johnny K plus eight of course how can I forget man they were they were some of the first guys to get popular like in the reality TV world of TLC and then they get divorced and it ends horribly just like Honey Boo Boo man Honey Boo Boo same thing it always ends horribly so hopefully it doesn't end that way I remember like seeing if your shtick is just how many kids you can have that is not gonna have a sustainable it's like sometimes you see these YouTubers and they come out real hot because it's like I'm buried alive with tarantulas 10 million clicks you're like yo but where to from here son where are you gonna go with this like this is not a sustainable path for you yeah I uh but I like these people I mean they seem like pretty like I don't know wholesome but we'll see how how money impacts things well you have Oprah on here and I think that chip and Joanna gained uh and other people like them like brene brown they're kind of filling this Oprah Gap like Oprah left some big shoes to fill I feel um and I've been Amazed by by the do you know do you follow brene Brown very much yeah my wife is reading all her stuff and like she's kind of killing it amongst like the empathy crowd the vulnerability crowd yeah yeah we're against those offense who are all about authenticity yeah the capital E uh or like if I hear one one more person say the n-word Nuance like that's like that that's the thing man it's Nuance it's empathy with that joke I was like Sam don't end it here man we've had a good run but don't end it here nuance uh Have You Seen Her Netflix special no no I I like her but that's not my speed it's a it's a gotta watch um it's that good it's that good so go watch her first Netflix special it's some you gotta watch it just because you've never seen anything like it it's basically Tony Robbins Oprah and a stand-up comedian at the same time like she comes out on stage like a stand-up comedian and she's funny without telling too many like jokes like it's not like set up punchline but she's funny but then she starts talking about vulnerability and herself and then people in the crowd are crying and you're just like what is hap what kind of event is this you're it's like you know twister with my emotions like I don't know what's going on I got right leg I'm sad and I got you know left hand on empowered I didn't know what was happening it's kind of an incredible little live show that she's created and I could at first I was like why would Netflix give a special to this person I don't even understand what that could be but it's actually pretty pretty well done for what it is and I could see why she's so likable why she is so like uh relatable to people you quickly went from like wow to wow [Laughter] uh no I'll I'll watch her do uh do you want can I tell you a little about Oprah so we we we're gonna talk about Oprah last time we didn't really know what we were talking about so I dug in a little bit I guess the the theme of this episode then is uh you know one of the TV Empires or female TV Empire or something like that I don't know let's get let's let's see uh TV Empires that everyone knows about that you and I are just discovering 20 years after the fact Empire's with empathy that the boys discover seven years after they they were off air capitalized both those E's uh all right I'll tell you a little bit about Oprah so she started at 17 by uh doing beauty pageants she won Miss Black Tennessee at age 19. she had her first job at CBS station in uh Nashville a few years later she moved to Maryland and uh then back to Nashville and eventually she was the first African-American news anchor uh on TV and that was in Nashville she basically had an issue where she struggled to show objectivity because she couldn't really report the news because she was showing too much empathy and she was pretty casual and at the time like this was like Hey Oprah you gotta like you know keep it straight you can't like Express remorse or like show too many too much emotions like well Let's uh let's take this a different way so she created a show called people are talking and that aired originally in 1977 and she would improvise and she was casual kind of like you and I at one point could say yeah she was like the MFM of the 70s um and by the end of the decade so after like three or four years she was beating Phil Donahue in the local ratings and Phil Donahue was God uh so he was like The Man In Charge So eventually she keeps doing that for a little while longer but in 1986 so about 10 years after starting that she gets her own show it's called the Oprah Winfrey Show and she along with a couple outside investors established her own production company called Harpo Productions Harpo's Oprah spelled backwards and at 32 years old she became the first black woman to have a nationally syndicated show and she still owns 80 of that production company and all along the the way she started like innovating innovating so in 1996 she created the uh her uh her book club which made 130 million in sales in the year one and arguably set the groundwork for this like massive influencer industry that we have then in 98 she co-founded the oxygen uh Media Group which has programming towards all types of uh shows mostly towards women she launched Oprah Magazine she had a radio show uh in 2010 the Oprah show ended after 24 years and she had you know all the best guests leading up till then 2011 she launched uh OWN Oprah Winfrey Network and then all along has been doing all types of stuff so for example in 2015 she bought 10 stake in Weight Watchers and then the stock 6X like within a year or two of that happening in 2008 she sold most of her uh stake to of own to Discovery and she's done a ton of interesting stuff between now and then but he listened to her Empire so she has the Oprah Winfrey Show which had over 20 20 8 000 guests giving away 570 cars had five presidents on um she got 20 000 fan letters the finale had 16.4 million views she also owns Harpo still to this day they've uh collectively it's done two billion dollars in profits and made a couple movies as well including the color purple beloved and Selma they have 200 employees in Chicago the uh own so the her network Oprah Winfrey Network uh it started with a hundred million dollars in funding eventually she sold most of the stake but she's still CEO of that she has Oprah Magazine which in the first year did 140 million in Revenue just from subscriptions and then she has Oprah and friends which is a uh uh XM radio contract uh or or show where she got 55 million dollars in the first three years she's invested in Weight Watchers True Food kitchens which is basically a restaurant that has 42 locations she uh helps start a food science startup backed by Oprah Katy Perry and a few others that has a billion dollar in valuation and she also is a big investor in Oatley then and this is finally she has a 45 million dollar estate in California a 14 million dollar one in Washington in Colorado she has 60 Acres for 14 million in Hawaii she has over a thousand acres and she has uh basically her net worth Grew From at age 32 she got her first million at 41 340 million 97 at the age of 43 550 million and at the age of 48 she became a billionaire so that's Oprah's story um super fascinating I mean she's been in the game forever it seems and I think she's what 60 something now and still killing it I didn't realize she was the CEO and like active and all this I thought she was more so like a face but I think she's actually not you know not just a face but uh it seems like she's like actually like a like a mogul a tycoon right you know what's uh one thing that stands out when we talk about these is that there is this like flywheel that happens once you become a certain level of famous it's almost like uh you know that that graph that's like going viral the [ __ ] around and find out graph is basically like [ __ ] around to find out but the positive version so you could kind of like if Oprah was like here's Oprah's maple syrup here's Oprah's um you know like new line of spoons here's Oprah's uh you know new board game like what does it really matter at this point it'd be like her board game does 50 million in sales her syrup is the number one syrup in the country right now like it's kind of at that point you just choose and because so much trust and distribution has been built up and I have a friend who this week I can't say the details but they went to a very famous person they went to a very famous person and they said they had a business idea they said hey uh our friend has a has a background in a certain industry and said hey famous person you should be doing something in that industry let me walk to you show up at your door knock at your door and say here's a full business plan of exactly how you would dominate in this category so they go they fly out knock on the door um first they don't meet the famous person famous person sends a a manager to them Senza by the way are they are they like A-list famous they're super famous yes super super famous got it okay A-list famous and so they go to them and first they get hit with a manager and they say they're trying to like look over the manager's head be like hey is a famous I just wanted to talk to just hoping to get a word in with the famous person can you get out of the way and they're like no no you have to get through this wall first they talk to the manager first they say hey look here's my background I've been super successful in this industry I think you guys could crush it in this industry um why don't can I meet the famous person now and tell them the idea they said no no tell me the idea I'm in charge of this I said okay here's the idea and then the person says manager says that's a good idea okay cool and um then they get the meeting with the the famous and the pull time they were told hey uh you fly in on Monday you'll meet with the famous person sometime this week just hang out in the hotel just be here which is a pretty big time move to try to pull on somebody to not give you a time but say hey we'll we'll hold this walkie-talkie would you hear me put your pants on get ready for the meetings happening but I I can't tell you everything like they've got a special calendar and Google it everything ends in ish but it's you know monday-ish you know like it's all ish right you're giving a window and you better be prepared it during that window to strike okay so end up getting the meeting with the with the famous person famous person comes in explain the whole idea famous person uh likes the idea but also has a bunch of their own ideas of course as famous people do and so I asked my friend later I said uh so what happened and uh the response was this they go well I'm pretty sure we convinced famous person that they should do this and do this with us and I'm pretty sure they convinced me that I should not do this with them I thought that was the hilarious takeaway and I was like okay well why they said well you know they have all their own ideas they go honestly everything they're trying to do in the space probably won't work like I think they're going about it the whole wrong way but they'll probably end up being successful anyways that's the crazy thing about this like uh their margin for error is so large and that it can kind of do anything and still have it work because their brand their celebrity their distribution their trust and loyalty In Their audience is so large that you can kind of mess up eight out of ten things and still get it get it to work eventually um whereas most startups most businesses don't have that margin for for error and so I don't know what the big takeaway is it's kind of a no dub but it's a if you're mega mega famous it's not hard at that point to do the Empire thing because uh it's like uh what was his name the noise from native how he when he was selling his company and they're like you sell just deodorant you know you're asking for this big valuation he goes yeah because uh do you know how to write the word native on a bottle of shampoo do you know how to write the word native on a on a bottle of toothpaste cool that's your expansion plan like I left a lot of room for this to grow if you could still write the word native on something it will work and that's that's how I feel about these Mega celebrity Brands which is like if you if you put my face on something it's gonna work so let's let's put this in in a very realistic context so you and I have that minus or no divided by a hundred so we're Oprah divided by a thousand whatever it is but we we have a very small taste of it and we also have friends you know like the Tim ferrisses of the world and and whoever else who have it you know times 10 or 20 for us and are in this like potentially billion dollar space there's been three things I think that I've narrowed it down to that make this Empire strategy um that whole hold me back and and I imagine someone like Tim who's a perfectionist or someone like that holds them back number one is reputational risk so putting your name on crap products and then how on Earth can you actually like track it all to make sure that you're not you're not putting your name on bad on bad products that you actually Stand By and so because of that it's almost like you have to pick and choose but then there's other people like Richard Branson that put you know virgin on everything and it kind of has seemed like it worked out uh so that's like the big thing number two is finding people who you can trust when you have five or ten or thirty different things going on you need really trustworthy people and even if it's your family even if it's your brother and your cousin people can screw you and like you have to really stay on top of it you have to find a partner who's good enough to like really have your back like even my accountant or imagine if like your lawyer your accountant and every once in a while you're like is this person actually thinking of me or how are they incentivized here and who's actually making the right decision that's actually exhausting and I think in in quite hard um and then the final thing is like do they want the headache of that so like a Joe Rogan uh he's just like no F this like I'm on my Island here I have what I need I don't want to put my name on anything uh screw that I I don't need anything and I want to keep things small and tight and so those are kind of the three things I think prevent like Empires from being built like this yeah I think that's true um so say that say the the first one again what was the first one do you remember reputational risk having people that you can trust and then just like not wanting more headache and here's the counter to each okay reputational risk put your your name on crap products do you uh have you drank Prime uh once I tried it it's fine it's fine it's also the fastest growing drink in the country right now and it's fine and I think that that's the the counter to that is yes you can't put it on a crap product or do something that would you know hurt people or do something like that like you know nothing nothing on the sort of terrible end of the register but there's a lot of leeway between the best product in the market and it's fine and you just gotta fall somewhere there right it's like a it's like you're playing golf and the Fairway is so wide you really gotta screw it up if you had to hit it out of bounds and that's how I feel with these products like is uh Kylie's lip product the best product on the market I have no idea is um you know for most of these products I can't tell you that Conor McGregor's whiskey or The Rock's tequila is uh is anything better than fine they might just be you're saying their head there's got to be a threshold there's a threshold or the threshold's pretty goddamn low so I think the reputational risk is is a little bit less than than what I what I think a lot of people would worry about uh the rest is true it can become a headache and you do have to find competent people to run them the good thing is when you have that brand it's like Prime the pro you know Prime didn't start by Logan Paul and KSI saying let's create a drink let's go to the flavor house and create a formulation there were some entrepreneurs who approached them that said we do this we've done this at you know medium scale with you guys we could go super scaled and we will take care of everything you guys take the cut you guys help us with the promotion but like look we come with this track record and I think that's what happens for most of these these celebrities as they're approached by people with track records like even the example I was just giving somebody with a track record came and said I know this industry I've done this before with your brand and your distribution we could do this again in a big way um and I think those opportunities just come knocking at your door so it's not even like where do I go find somebody great it's like can I filter can I just like recognize great when it shows up shows up at my door is really the uh the question for most these people do you think you would enjoy that type of Fame like chip and Joanna no um Not only would I not enjoy it from a like oh I don't want to get bothered when I'm out and about with my kids and stuff like that but also I more than that is I don't enjoy what it takes to get there and that's actually what goes like that's actually the most important question of business I was talking to Ben Levy about this the other day we're talking about business ideas earlier earlier I asked you this a while ago and you go there's a price to pay I ain't willing to pay it yeah exactly know the price and then decide if you're if you're gonna pay it um when we were talking about business ideas it was like oh do we like this idea or this idea and the easy thing to do I think everybody gets this wrong is like I love basketball so I want to do a basketball based idea or I love I'm really passionate about like helping people so I'm gonna do this Healthcare startup whatever it may be and they think that their enjoyment of the of the thing is going to be based on the product or category that they're in but in reality most of the time you spend when you're an entrepreneur is trying to grow or sell it's trying to get more customers and grow grow their actual business and so you're not playing basketball your day-to-day experience is actually about selling and trying to grow and what ends up happening is that some ways are more enjoyable or suit you better than others so for some people they love Facebook ads or they love SEO and for some people they love phone calls and for some people they love high-level business deals Enterprise sales uh where you're nurturing a long relationship for a long period of time and the big mistake people make is they think oh I'm creating a basketball related startup what they don't realize is that the only way for that business to grow is through Enterprise sales and they hate Enterprise sales so they're unwilling to go and sell to these facility managers of NBA stadiums or they're unwilling to sell to blah blah blah and they think they're in the basketball business but they're in the Enterprise sales business because ninety percent of their day-to-day work and they're they're the challenge that they're faced with and the the stuff they have to do the whether they're selling basketballs or ping pong balls or uh books it doesn't matter it's the the sales channel the sales process is where you're gonna spend most of your time so you got to figure out which sales process do I like the most or at least tolerate the best and then find a business that uses that sales process right I think that is like a I wish somebody had told me that earlier because I got tripped up with this for many many years and when I look back I'm like oh I just really like growing things through Facebook ads it's like it to me it's way better than these other ones and so like so I have a list I'm like my favorite sales channel is just mention it on the podcast it couldn't be anything easier than that like if I could just tell people what I think about this product and then they go buy it because they already trust me and they like me and we have enough listeners to this product uh to this podcast that is the number one easiest sales Channel most pleasurable so if I can think of a business that works in that fantastic number two for me is Facebook ads why because I don't have to talk to anybody I sit behind the computer I set up the budget and when it works I just scale it up with the push of a button I don't have to hire more sales people I don't have to like go do something new you can take one image that works or one video One 10 second video that works in Facebook ads and put millions of dollars of spend behind it and make multiple Millions more off that ad I love that I love that model I like that I can look at the dashboard see a number and know what to do I yes that's like my number two and my number three is cold emails because I'm good at Cold emailing and it's kind of a pain in the ass but I've done it before I can train people to do that I've had a cold email in order to generate customers those are my three favorites everything else I don't like as much and so when I think of an idea it's got to fall in that top three have you so we had I guess technically the hustle kinda was Enterprise sales I mean we had six maybe once or twice we had seven figure deals and that's like a long process I wasn't allowed to go to those meetings because like I remember like I had to go and buy like brown shoes and like tight jeans and like tuck my shirt in and like a certain way I was like dude like I'm Todd nice to meet you uh like uh it wasn't for me got all the details wrong just a tank top tucked in some khakis which are tucked into some brown shoes yeah yeah you're not created everything right before the meeting they're like Sam that the buttons are supposed to be in the front that was a breakaway yeah so I was like was learning as I as I went but as the owner of a company that had Enterprise sales it is awesome because what I didn't realize there's this amazing thing that I learned which is that sales teams can create demand so even if your product our product was great but even if your product is okay if you have a good sales team you can truly create demand and I didn't understand that until like year two or three of like having a team like this I'm like oh my God this is how the world works because most big companies they just have a certain amount of budget they have to spend it on something and if you just get in with them and you wind and dine them and you they like you half the time the product doesn't even matter they just have to spend it otherwise next year they won't have the same budget if they don't have the same budget they don't have a job so and you can like that or you cannot like it frankly I don't love that that that's like the truth but if you can make it work it's pretty amazing and I like learned that the hard way while running a company like this and if you don't know which one you like your best bet is to go get exposure to a bunch of them so go go try your hand and do like a six month rotation where you're basically like okay how do I do this Enterprise sales thing how do I do cold calling how do I do Google ads how do I do these different things and figure out which one of these appeals to you because once you do that then then you could kind of pick and choose I know most most people and I think you you would find this to be true most successful people we know they don't really hop around sales channels that much it's like no if they're good at find one thing and you kill it yeah oh you're good at SEO they just do SEO four different times of four different flavors oh you good at Facebook ads you do Facebook ads for one business then another business then another business if you're good at uh Enterprise sales you just figure out you know which businesses to plug into that over time and they kind of make a career out of really understanding one growth process because being a master at any growth thing is uh is super super valuable oh platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better [Music] um do you want to talk about hustle GP GPT 3 or do you want to go to another topic um which let's do some quicker ones I feel like we did a long long-winded thing so I have I have a couple quick ones tell me okay so I'm gonna give you my two uh bad dating ideas and by the way I'd like to to put another drunk ideas on the books to uh to just put that out there this would have been in my drunk ideas thing but we don't have it scheduled so I'm just gonna do it sober so um two bad dating ideas um number one do you watch this TV show love is blind Sarah does so it's on my TV all the time okay good so you know that you and my wife have like the exact same TV stuff like for the listener Sean and Sarah are texting about Bachelor or Bachelorette or whatever it's called yeah or no what do you guys talk about the challenge the challenge but also these other shows so um so love is blind is this like sensation Show on Netflix which is basically like you get a bunch of single people together they're in these rooms they can't see each other so you kind of speed date you're dating you date other people but you never get to see them so you're only supposed to fall over their personality and then after you choose who you like the best on their personality then you get to see them and you get to see what happens okay so and don't you like get married at the end yeah well of course to to like any great story you need stakes and so they've raised the stakes by saying you don't just get to pick say oh I like Sam the best let me I want to see him now it's like in order to see him he must get engaged blind and get married four weeks later so they like you know that's how they make it a TV show but some people walk walk on the altar yeah well a lot of people when they see the other person they're like oh hey it's so good to see you like they're just like oh man like I imagine something different and now I'm stuck with you right now I look like an [ __ ] because I fell in love with your personality and I fell out of love with your face uh but they can't say that so they have to find some other excuse one guy on the show was like they're trying to get an idea of how uh how they looked and they go so I'm pretty the guy was like I only weigh 150 pounds yes could I give you a piggy background he goes and it was so smooth the way he did it and vice versa he terrible he goes I love to go to music festivals she's like me too he goes at music festivals you know I uh I usually put my girlfriend up on my shoulders um do you think I'd be able to do that he's like did she catch it yeah she was like uh like no that's my worst nightmare is a guy like struggling to lift my body weight and so she was just like what the hell but what size rowboat do we need on this on this season there's one guy she they fell in love and then they meet and he's just he's not he's not bad looking or whatever but he's does really intense eye contact like the guy doesn't blink and she's like you're gonna never known this from behind the wall and so she's like haha like how come you're not looking away and he's like what what do you mean I am blinking and she's like no like please look away it's like so uncomfortable to watch so anyways great show I think somebody should take this show on the road literally I think somebody should do a I think the show but if not the show then somebody should spin this off do a Love is Blind tour where you go City to city and people pay to be a part of the experiment so people pay to actually like do the show themselves I also think you should do a podcast version of Love is Blind because podcast is Audio Only so it's already no visual so you could have two people talking and you could sort of edit and cut this together and make a a pod version of Love is Blind so I think people could take this concept of this dating show or it could be other dating shows too but make a make a tour out of it make a show out of it where it's going from City to city and people get to participate almost like American Ninja Warrior some people get to participate and other people get to watch the the show going down and uh I think that these things could generate a lot of money ticket wise because Netflix has done the hard work of educating the market and so once you get that education in the market now somebody should go to them and get the license like we talked about this with uh kids cartoons like or they can just call it like uh love with poor eyesight [Laughter] I forgot my glasses love so so like people did this with a cartoon that was a I gave you a laugh to try to like you know smooth it over um but like kids cartoons like blippi or cocoa melon there's these companies that go and they license the rights to create the cocomelon live tour or the blippi live tour and I've gone to these and these I did a segment on the Pod about these these things make millions of dollars a year yeah well the every parent loves it's like where you can't really there's not many places you could take a tiny kid that's like kid friendly but this is perfect because they already love these cartoons on YouTube and so I'm willing to pay 50 bucks a ticket times four so I pay 200 bucks then I buy the merch then I buy the snacks because of course my kids want snacks and you know we go there and we've dropped 400 500 by the by the end of it or you know something like that and so these these shows can make a lot of money and so I think somebody could do this with other television shows including the dating shows that's not a bad idea at all well that's that's a great idea something worse you should have seen an average person trying to explain that idea you would have laughed in the bathroom okay here's my second Love is Blind on tour ah even that sounds all right so my second uh bad dating uh idea okay so you've heard about this like dating app Raya you know about this app it's basically a dating app originally for famous people but now it's like dating apps for people with like verified on Instagram or something yeah I don't even really understand it I think somebody needs to come over the top on Raya and make the even more Elite dating app so I'm calling it Daddy here's what Daddy is so daddy daddy or daddy you know we're debating it internally so daddy is an app where for a guy to be on Daddy actually let me first start with the girls side okay for a woman to be on Daddy she's got a basically audition or apply and we're only accepting the top one percent of eligible women so this is beautiful but not just beautiful smart but not just smart you got to be living in a in a town a big city so that you know you're available to be to be to be uh you know reached to be dated so beautiful smart top one percent maybe even point one percent of applicants get in more more Elite than Harvard and then on the guy side you got to pay 25 000 a year to be on the app so that's the app idea five thousand men if you can get five thousand men who have the money to drop 25 G's on their dating app they get access to this Elite Pool of women who want access to this Rich group of men and it is what it is that's our slogan it is what it is is it right nah but it is what it is okay and so it is what it is it's Rich guys with beautiful smart women and the business model is if we can get 5 000 guys to pay us this amount that's a hundred million dollars a year business does that sound like something you might be interested in [Laughter] so when I was studying like for Hampton to launch Hampton I was like curious about communities and there's a bunch of a lot of people are like you should charge like a hundred grand a year and the reason being is there's a bunch of communities out there where the whole thing of making it Elite and Community is just can you pay the money yes and I was thinking about that and I'm like first like the audacity and second if you can get my first question is how dare you you are yeah who are you uh and the but if you can get past that how amazing is that where your whole business is just ah if you could pay it you're probably good so we'll just uh we'll we'll be we'll happen to be that middleman and check it out and so there's this app called The League do you know what the league is it's a dating app it started when we're in San Francisco about this woman named Amanda Bradford who I'm friends with here in Austin she sold it recently to what's the big the big company IAC who owns like match and Bumble and or not Bumble Tinder and what Amanda was getting started she was or the the league kind of took off and so I don't you probably don't know it was the premise right it was like only it was like an Ivy League but then she one day she was like how hard can I push this and so right now the league costs I believe it's either 499 or 999 dollars so it's either 499 or 999 it's one of those two and the reason being is that's the highest price per month that you can charge on Apple's uh on the Apple Store 399 per month sorry yeah 399 dollars per month so yeah it's it's the highest that you could possibly charge and she goes screw it that's what it's going to cost to get premium features and people like at our I think her team was like this is crazy we can't do this no one will do this and it crushed it an IAC came to her and they're like we want to buy you because how on Earth are you able to charge this and I imagine in her head she was like well it was actually pretty easy I just uh added an extra nine at the end actually you're right nine the highest tier is called investor uh member 299 owner 399 investor 999.99 yeah yeah yeah it's like uh it's like uh there's like an episode in South Park where they come up with this like new MBA and they're like look I don't make up the rules I just think them up and write them down you can't argue with me I didn't make up the rules and it's like well how'd you increase pricing so much well I just clicked that button nine and uh we added we made it instead of 999 we made it 900 or instead of 99.99 it was 999 so anyway it's killed it and so I actually think that there are a lot of interesting opportunities in the market where you can just charge way more and it feels very weird that's the business model and actually now that I think about it twenty five thousand dollars a year that was complete small boy stuff and I apologize to the entire audience this needs to be 100 Grand a year this has to be 100 Grand a year and guess what we only need a thousand members now we only need a thousand guys who are willing to drop 100 Grand in order to get access to the most and in fact you know what we're gonna do we're gonna take a portion of that money and we're gonna pay some women to be on this app we're gonna say look you are so great you were casted onto this and you are going to be paid to be a part of this network because um we want to blur the lines between prostitution and legal dating oh my God it is what it is as we say God bless you maybe this will work but yeah good but I think there's there needs to be more uh apps that do this that go over the top uh with it like I agree basically find the theoretical Max of uh of of what what the market will bear or what uh what people actually want to do right like what what is the actual Behavior people want and what are they willing to do and it's usually more than you think um or more than you know sound sounds reasonable like what what if you just took an unreasonable approach to the same thing what would you do differently is it is a question you can ask about really any business like there's these guys that created this thing called the unreasonable Institute back in the day and I loved Is that real yeah it was a great it was a great idea is it called the unreasonable Institute and it was for I just love the name because I loved the entire premise which was what good has been come from just taking a reasonable approach to something if you're trying to make any big [ __ ] happen you're trying to do anything change the way anything works you know like create a new system or improve something or innovate you know in a way by definition you're going to do something slightly unreasonable um and so is this called the unreasonable group yeah it was called the unreasonable Institute then they had the unreasonable like toward where they like they like on a cruise ship and went into international waters um and then they did a bunch of this now it's probably called this is like 10 plus years ago so yeah that's so funny that's probably true well there's a thing called unreasonable group and it's the unreasonable Collective is an International Community of sophisticated investors we pull we pull Capital as a community and co-invest in world class but then there's the unreasonable Institute which is a fast track program to give altruistic entrepreneur skills and funding to affect large-scale change yeah I think that's the one sounds maybe a little yeah the first one maybe sounds cooler though but uh uh that's cool I like that name um speaking of unreasonable you want to wrap this up by talking one thing Elon Musk okay did you see what he did uh so you see the Twitter thing well which which sort of thing I feel like every day there's a Elon Musk Twitter thing yeah that's where he blurred out the W oh yeah oh okay this is news no no I saw this so basically this is to explain this this is dumb there's this there's this thing in the UFC call if you win so basically the UFC and all but fighting it has weight divisions and every once in a while someone like Conor McGregor or someone else comes along and they achieve greatness and they earn what's called The Champ champ status meaning they have a champ uh they're the champion in one weight Division and then while having that belt they also gain a few pounds and go up and win another belt it's unheard of in my opinion Elon is the champ champ he has amazing products he's one of the best entrepreneurs out there he's the champion he's also the most cringiest he's the champ champ right now uh he does whatever the [ __ ] he wants that's what champ Champs do and recently like last night he tweeted out that there was a dispute with the landlord saying you can't like alter the sign or something like that so he took like a piece of white sheet or paper or something and he blurred out the W so now Twitter the sign it's a huge sign when you live in San Francisco I lived a block away from it it says titter and it's the most cringed thing I've ever seen why on Earth would he do that I love a good troll but that's not like funny it just makes like people like look I like trolling I love punching up uh but this is like uh this is punching yourself in the face I like making people uncomfortable this is the bad type of uncomfortable go to his Twitter uh right now do you see what his name is on Twitter right now because you thought that was the cringiest thing he's done in the last 48 hours well he's one-upped himself oh my God what an idiot oh God what is his Twitter name his name right now is hey hairy balls he spells balls b-o-l-z but it's hairy balls that is his name on Twitter right now oh Elon you're so you're so irreverent yeah dude these Billionaire's senses of humor just like us I would love to see what Elon thinks the like other people's reaction is he must type these in and just sit back and just smirk just have a smug look on his face just imagine oh man the internet's gonna love this I I'm super rich but I don't take myself too seriously look at this yeah next week it's gonna be like uh like Elon baller 69. like it's just like this is the lamest thing ever man I don't know how I mean I guess like look with extreme personalities comes to extreme success but they don't tell you there's another end of that bell curve and that's extreme that's extreme cringe and that and we're experiencing that a little bit right now I know a lot of billionaires not a lot I know a couple billionaires and I know a lot of wildly successful people and they do every once in a while like you're like oh hey man you don't know how to hold a conversation appropriately let me help you out here this is kind of what's happening with him it just so happens that it's in front of 125 million followers he has like the cringe version of Tourette's like dude just stop you can't he can't stop just blurting out these cringy things yeah it's it's ridiculous um he's he I actually think that he's kind of ruining his legacy for sure here um like maybe five years ago he was the man um and he still is the man frankly like his accomplishments are amazing but he's a little less of the man at this point it was a funny just a little funny back and forth he uh somebody tweeted out a um a graph of all the billion dollar chart of all the billion dollar companies and what industries they're in yeah I saw that and uh Paul Graham retweeted and he says oh you know what's interesting here is like we're clearly like over indexed online software and like you know real world things like uh Hardware or manufacturing you know there's only like a few companies in that bucket um but don't let that hold you back you should still do it I think there's a lot of opportunity there and Elon replied and was like um yeah like a complete waste uh you know it says something like it was like a big waste of um of resources or brain power or talent that that was the case and then uh and the the response was the biggest own and I've seen in a week it was it was a really good reply program goes yeah can you think of anybody right now who's really talented and uh it could be doing those things but is wasting their time on a software project and it's so good because obviously talk about Elon um and uh yeah it's like a perfect self cell phone really by Elon yeah it was pretty good [Laughter] took it it was good that was good I'm a big fan of him um of Paul Grant I'm still an Elon guy I think I might get myself a Tesla but I don't like this it makes it hard to want to wear like a Tesla t-shirt that's for sure not that he cares but uh it makes it challenging to like root for him publicly when he makes these stupid comments people people in our comments hate when I make fun of uh Elon or or dis Elon or chamoth or these guys uh because they're like fans of them which is totally fair you could be fans of whoever you want uh but I just wanted for the record I'm out on Elon early because guess what more and more you're gonna be out on this guy over time and I just want to plant the flag I'm out on him early because his cringe will eventually wash away all these people or he's gonna get canceled for something I'm telling you it's it's gonna happen and I I would like the record to show that I was out early dude these these people in our comments are crazy to me because why can't someone do a lot of really good stuff and also some bad stuff like why can't like someone kick ass at a at a ton of different things and make a huge amount of mistakes totally uh because whenever we talk about this we say yeah he's he's the best at a bunch of different things he's the greatest entrepreneur he's of of I don't know the last 30 years 50 years that is true also true he's pretty cringe and uh Courtney and disingenuous amounts of some things right that's also true yeah it's like I can love Michael Jackson's music and also not love what he did you know like both like both can exist I can like Chick-fil-A chicken and also not stand by what they right what they stand for you know both can be true and I and I can't stand that with the with the commenters on our on our stuff but let's we're gonna get a reaction on this I'm eager to see what it is but uh anyway that's an action-packed pod I think [Music]

uh what could you get for it you think I would not be interested in having any conversations for you know less than uh you know on the order of like what you got like the hustle or um uh morning Brew or you know stuff like that tens of millions yeah yeah yeah uh I mean I just think like the value of what we've built both as a business and revenue and our audience uh and our durability is you know is is in that category [Music] laughs all right what's up we got a uh crossover episode call me Tim Hardaway we got the guys from acquired yeah you like that you like that that's good that's good baby yeah that's for the uh the five percent of of listeners who who know about basketball so we got uh the guys from acquired are here we're doing kind of um a joint episode a uh the old Alabama wedding as I like to call it you know just we're just getting we're getting cousins together here because you guys got a podcast that is uh pretty awesome I remember when I was working at uh at our previous startup a guy came to me was like there's a podcast You're Gonna Love it's called Acquired and I go what is it he goes it's like the backstories of these like of all Great Tech Acquisitions like how it all went down they go into like all the nerdy details and then I binged you guys for like six days straight um and so that was that's how I kind of first got into it a couple years ago so welcome to the show David and Ben thank you we did a super fun Crossover with you a couple years ago now all but it was just with Sean Sam you were off traveling the world doing amazing things uh well that's what he said he was like you're probably doing something amazing I was like uh probably just like a doctor's appointment or something it's probably yeah you guys have totally come up since then the uh I mean you were big back then but uh that was like within the first couple months I think of you starting this and uh it's just been awesome to watch how far you've come that was kind of an art even though it was year four or five for us that was kind of our early days too because uh Sean you're right that we were mostly about Acquisitions at that point and we talked about the bibo acquisition right as part of the episode and now we do these like three four hour entire you know history and strategy of a company regardless of whether there was a transaction but um yeah that that feels like uh I don't know the funny thing about exponential growth is it feels like a lifetime ago all the time I always think about that like when you pick a niche and then you kind of are gonna run out but the niche can get you somewhere so for example I was thinking about this with coffee Zilla the YouTube guy who exposed business people's scams and I'm like and then he did one the other day that was like he dm'd a celebrity to promote some nft thing like hey we'll pay you to promote this nft thing and like the white paper said like this shit's a scam or whatever but he didn't read it obviously he just promoted it he's like huh scammer and I'm like but you cut that's kind of entrapment like you you're running out of people to like to to cover here you ended up create scammers like I don't think that's like Ali G back in the day yeah exactly but like that wasn't his original stick but I was like yeah you're not gonna like you're trying to be on this YouTube once a week treadmill and there's not once a week gonna be a giant Logan Paul like celebrity name did this bad thing and I'm gonna be the exposer it's like what are you gonna do next Tuesday because there's not like this isn't that that current uh but you guys did a good job of switching it up people said that to us Sean they go you're gonna run out ideas and I was like yeah we might but then it just kind of like morphed into like us saying a lot of like it's like people are when I someone yesterday was like what's your podcast about I was like well the name's pretty bad it's definitely a lot about business but we also make a lot of horrible more jokes too so people kind of like it for that reason yeah I've been thinking about this a lot your Niche earns you the right to exist but it's in in media but it's your um your sort of demeanor and your the way that you look at the world that then gives you license to expand from there so like if David labor my friend I just think if David and I had started with like we're a podcast that talks about businesses it's like cool next but if you like pitch people on really specifically what they're what you'd like the job to be done of your show and their life is then you can sort of like expand and explore from there right like benj Ben should have been producer Ben should have been like you know you know Mormons taking over the world started with the Mormon Community then expanded from there I remember talking to the guys from wait but why that great blog yeah and um this guy wait guys is there a team it's not just him it's Tim and then it's his childhood friend Andrew who does like the back end all the business stuff they have a really interesting business they like acquire companies that are completely unrelated to white but why like that's how they make their money and then they just want fun like that's kind of the the model but I was asking him about content because I was like you know I admire way but why so tell me about this and I was like you know I'm trying to figure this out I kind of like to talk about this and I kind of like to talk about this and he's like you need your uh like your Flagship franchise and you do your franchise and then people will love that franchise but they'll also love you and they'll you'll earn the right to talk to them about like oh you want to talk about like mindset stuff cool but unless you think mindset is the right place to start wait earn the the Trust on the business side and then say by the way here's my mindset stuff and then you'll get some percentage of people have crossed over and then a new audience there too you just keep launching new franchises after that I love it it's so cheap it's also like the we even you guys you know you started several years after us but like I think you still work when did you guys start three years ago September of 2019 I think or July yeah later than yeah we were 2015. but even in 29 like it was still kind of earliest enough days in podcasting that like the medium was the mainstream portion of podcasting meeting was still early enough that people were looking for new stuff right and like that I think has changed now in a pretty big way the way that it started was basically like I was in Austin or somewhere I was living in San Francisco at the time and Sean texted me and he was like hey I have an idea for a podcast here's the pilot do you guys wanna does hustle want to be the publisher and I listened to it and I like I just listened to the intro and I was like yep we're in let's just air this exact one next week and we'll start by the way that was a little bit of a fib I I basically told you I was like hey you know why I was like why don't you do podcasts and Sam was like ah like I gotta hire somebody to do it I don't know we were focused on this email thing I was like well I got a podcast I'm gonna do a podcast will you be the publisher he's like and I was like I already I knew that to seal the deal I needed to send him a file but I hadn't recorded yet so I go I already did the first episode uh you want like take a listen to it and then I like just ghosted him on messenger for 24 hours so I could go record the episode then came back was like oh my bad here's the file so there really wasn't an episode when I first messaged you but I was like I got the vibe that if this is good if I get like a good first 35 seconds this is done and uh so that's what I went and did yeah and we were like we're in and then he did it his way it was called my first million because it was like first million users Revenue whatever and it was great it was great as it was but like there was one time like three months in where a guest didn't show up and he was like uh I booked the space do you just want to come and like talk and I was like I guess and we did that and then it kind of like did well but like our the first episode he did by himself it got 65 000 downloads and we were like dude podcasting podcasting is easy this is gonna be awesome and then over the next 12 months it basically went down to like as low as maybe 10 or 15 000 and then since then it's basically just been a slow grind now we're anywhere from 100 to 200 000 per dot per episode if you include the YouTube our YouTube is is pretty weak it's like 20 to 50 000 20 to 100 000 and then the RSS feed which is like iTunes and all that stuff that's um maybe a hundred uh or something like that what uh where are you guys at because like no one talks about this stuff like whenever you Google I remember we were Googling like how do we get to 100 000 downloads but everyone out there was like here's how you get your first thousand first ten thousand I was like okay but like how do we get bigger we're we're almost the exact same scale with a very different journey I mean every journey is unique on this stuff uh so our episodes get about 200 000 downloads listens whatever you want to call it um uh which is interesting because Spotify has become so much more of the market now uh per episode but unlike you guys we do like one episode a month you know one to two episodes a month and they're really really long so uh we I have with a few exceptions that we can talk about we've never had like kind of big spike viral you know breakout moments it's been a you know eight year Journey from like zero up to that um we don't really have spikes like there's spiky stuff but it's not like a true like virality moment and interesting you guys so one thing that's interesting about content media is everybody measures the number nobody measures the quality because the quality is way harder to understand yeah but clearly there's a difference between 200 000 people listening to an episode of acquired versus 200 000 views on a tick tock okay we get that because it's kind of short versus long but even if it was a podcast about sports versus a podcast about business Acquisitions the type of people that are going to listen to your thing are just inherently more valuable um have you guys thought about that seen that do you guys uh I mean that's the whole that is the whole business not that you started or do this for the business side although it's become a great business this um that is the whole business side and and also on the content side too like we made we started doing this for us to learn and then we were like well who you know would also want to learn for video people like us and that's kind of who we make it for like um so we struggle with YouTube with Tick Tock with Twitter like we're not good on any of those other platforms even though we do atomize content and do it now because like we don't it's just not kind of how we designed the show and to to ground it uh 40 of acquired listeners are c-level or VP level Executives 23 are currently Founders 12 were previously Founders and if you break down by job Seventeen percent or engineers 15 are actively CEOs today and 12 are product managers and so like the whole business for us and to David's point it didn't start as a business but where we are today is like I don't really want millions of listeners I want acquired to like kind of slow its growth but saturate the niche that we're in because I think it's the most valuable audience in the world right and I don't know exactly what that leads to but like all the conversations David and I get to have with our listeners because of who they are are like super fascinating well what will it lead to so like you know you do you you can probably make a great living off of just the advertising but I'm looking at your site you don't sell anything um What's It Gonna lead to well we do have merch uh who do you're wearing right now is pretty dope this is marquez's Hoodie yeah uh which uh uh David ml who's on marquez's team is a uh uh become a good friend and is an acquired listener and uh he hooked me up with this this hoodie rocks yeah I I sent the picture to our merch person I screenshotted uh and I had that moment where I was like you know that thing we were on a zoom call I don't know if you guys do this but you screenshot and it's like makes the really loud ass sound of like a screenshot has been taken and then you gotta like address it like it was a fart during the during the call I was really worried that when I said I can't help if we were doing that thing uh on every slide of my deck this is a total digression and we'll come back to it but um fourth wall uh makes there so Marquez is an investor in fourth wall Walker Williams the founder he was the founder of Teespring uh awesome guy we've gotten to know him um we're talking to them now I think yeah yeah merch yeah they're uh they are great and they made this fully custom for Marquez uh and it's it's the best Marquez being uh what's his name Brownlee is that his MKBHD yeah the uh the you I mean you said first name like he's Oprah like you know I was like oh it's that guy well he has like 20 million YouTube subscribers I mean I just know him as like the guy who interview uh reviews uh uh Tech but he also like has interviewed Tesla uh Elon and all these like great guys I mean he's cool unless they've come on this podcast they're I don't know them this podcast in my mind he's also the craziest thing is like as if it wasn't enough to operate this like pretty large scale TV Production Studio at this point as a as a YouTuber um he's also like one of the best Ultimate Frisbee players in the world oh really yeah he's a professional Ultimate Frisbee player I didn't see that I can see it that's a very obvious crossover do you so like when we'll just talk real Insider baseball for a second and then we'll move on but with podcasting a lot of people ask us how to start it and stuff like that and I'm like I don't know how to grow it it's quite challenging but what I've really enjoyed getting to know is like Andrew huberman I'm you know I'm acquaintances but not friends friends with him really but like we'll chat every once in a while and he's like I've seen each other with their shirts off but we I mean I wouldn't call each other friends but like we've sauna together this is like oh I was probably at a doctor's appointment but like your life is just like I listen to you guys I'm like wow no bro he was he was on our but he was on our pod so like I know him like an hour plus like five text messages exchanged so like that's the extent that I know him uh but he I think there if you look at Spotify when he releases an episode it's typically the most popular on uh the charts and I think they're in the million Mark million per uh episode which is how we like to measure it is there anyone else in the business category that's in the 205 I mean all in is probably 400 maybe 500 000 do you know like how big do you have to be to be some of the biggest of course there's Dave Ramsey he's he's in a whole different category yeah it's funny it depends because like business kind of gets lumped in with all these other like personal finance type categories but I think in our ilk um yeah they should make it separate the best budgeting category and move Dave Ramsey's ass over there yeah yeah uh you know and it's all into like has been an amazing breakout they've become more of a mainstream news and political show I mean they still talk Tech in business but um that I think is a lot of Their audience and they're huge now but yeah our category I would say like invest like the best probably is the most directly comparable in terms of size and audience makeup also Founders and David Sandra um and he's part of the Colossus network with Patrick um who else uh Jason's other show this week in startups uh that we go on all the time but Logan Bartlett has um a much smaller audience because he's much newer but like a plus guests and really I mean he's I think he's he's got the the most valuable niche of niche in terms of the people who listen to his show why because of VCS it's like Silicon Valley insiders for lack of a better I mean it's VCS it's Founders but I think like his interviews I always feel like he pulls out the most valuable geez small boy stuff right there let me ask you a different question that I've actually never asked so so you so David said something a second ago which is kind of like the paraphrase would be we made the podcast for people like us or we made the podcast that we would want to listen to is that fair to kind of summarize your position David 100 and I feel like that with this podcast I started the milk road that way but it quickly transformed into like crypto news which is actually not what I actually a lot of people know this I've said this I don't read or consume the news so it's really funny that we made a news like thing and got it big and then sold it but like truthfully it didn't end up becoming the thing that like I made this for me for people like me out there Sam do you subscribe to that like I guess like in theory you could say the best thing to do is to scratch your own itch to build the product you want be you know make it for people like you then you're not guessing but then in practice sometimes you know the mass Market is not where you're at and you go for that so Sam what's your take on that I think we it was it started MFM started that way and it is mostly that way every once in a while you know Sean will be like we need more views let's like get this guessed and sometimes we give into it sometimes we don't the hustle started out because I liked the news and then about a year two years in I was like I don't care about the news anymore but this is my job so I'm gonna keep doing it um I don't I don't I listen to zero business podcasts now I basically only listen to like crime and fiction and things like that and so I don't listen to business podcast anymore but I think this podcast has mostly stayed of just like what do I want to do what does Sean what do we want to talk about yeah it's mostly stayed that way but we we do like have to fight like I was messaging Sean like this uh this last night and I was like dude we need to be stricter about our guests because we've had like a bunch of people uh like who asked to come on and we're like yeah they're huge and then I'm like wait I don't give a about this person I don't like I don't I wouldn't want to have like if this person invited me over for dinner I wouldn't be excited and so we definitely have to fight that I would assume you know this is we're realizing that it's the case for us although it's different because we tell stories but um for you guys I would like the reason your audience is here so for you right like it's not for your gas right yeah I think sometimes though the the guests you know I basically told Sam I said there's three to three three or four types to guess for the here's the four that I think exists there's the people that are like us and they're just bringing a different like Flavor new fresh ideas so like for example when you guys first came on you guys you got the stick you knew what we do on this podcast I remember you guys came with a bunch of business ideas you're like oh this Airbnb Wi-Fi network that's like you know oh my God you remember even the idea yes I saw your face that I did came back to me right I got like that some people have photographic memory I have an idea memory I can remember any idea so that was like you guys got the stick so you came on you brought ideas which is great because the audience loves that Steph Smith is a great example of this she comes on she brings ideas people like her even though she's not the big name you know famous oh CEO of X she does an amazing job so that's like number one number two is basically like they are the big name so somebody who a bunch of people are gonna click on it might bring new audience it's like you're you're legit famous in some way you had a pop on recently yeah well how he would be three which is internet famous it's like legit famous it's like you know they're they've they kind of like outside my Paris Hilton or something yeah like they don't have a podcast or they don't have a newsletter they don't have like an internet Community they're just like famous famous then there's you're internet famous and the last one is personal like we want to nerd out with them and so that would be like like Ariel helwani yeah we had arrow hawani on like I don't know how much of our audience cared about that but I cared I wanted to have that conversation um and we've had you know Sam was like oh this guy Ken write out is awesome he's like this 50 year old like Marathon record breaker guy like I just want to talk to him and it's like great let's do that so it's kind of like we are going to be so into the conversation and we are sure that this person is interesting to us it'll be interesting to some portion of the audience and so it's like to us those are the four and I think the one you get tripped up on the most is just the the legit famous person because they they don't actually listen to the Pod they may not bring bring the juice and it's almost like the expectations are high and you almost disappoint because it's like oh all right well that was kind of a lame conversation with that person and they don't have any of their own distribution the nice thing about internet famous is at least they can help distribute the content but real regular famous people it's like unless they're getting put in People magazine or cast in the latest movie they actually have no way to reach an audience directly yeah you know who does that for us is darmesh the founder of HubSpot every time he comes on he get his episodes get really popular and he's always doing he is popular and his content is great and also he always does some internet marketing stuff where he he kills it he kills him for us every time that's that's the best kind of guest that'll come on and promote right and he pays the bills too so he's the sponsor he's the guest he drives the girl yeah come on acquired the crazy thing we notice about guests recently just looking at our analytics and the the two things and both of them are true 100 of the time without fail one every single time we set a new episode record it is an episode that is like just David and I doing Nintendo lvmh Berkshire Hathaway like our canonical three-hour format and two every single time we have a guest on it is less listened to than our previous episode yeah interesting just last question is how do you guys prepare for that do you just like both read the same book and take notes and then just tell a story we mostly read different stuff but uh we've kind of architected I mean this is our like our differentiation as a show which is so anti-all the rules of podcasting but I think is what makes us special is we have carved out that like we can take a month in our lives and do you know it's kind of like if you're writing a term paper in college like we can do the research independently each of us on a company on a topic and then we come together and it's like uh I don't know it's like a thesis defense or something that we do the goal is like between the two of us to have basically consumed every piece of content on the company like every other podcast that's ever been done all the big books that have been written all the talks given by the founder try and find a bunch of weird stuff like talks given at industry conferences that have low view counts on YouTube obviously read all the sources of all of the Wikipedia page for the companies it's basically like no one should be able to DM us after the episode and be like oh did you did you see this important piece of information on the company we want to always be like defensively no we have consumed everything about this company and I think like I think the magic is that like if we if the output of that were a term paper it would be really boring and nobody would read it but because the output of that is Ben and I as really good friends like talking about it like that kind of makes it magical yeah the friends we've been noodling on is conversational audiobooks oh that's cool to describe what it is are there any odd commonalities that you've seen amongst like the Savages that you've done stories on so for example Ben Wilson has you know he does uh how to take over the world and it's historical figures and he's like you know it's weird John Rockefeller Edison and Napoleon a bunch of these other people they ate really lightly like they didn't eat a ton of food because they said that when they over ate they felt brain fog and but for a bunch of different reasons are there any uh strange commonalities that you've you've found amongst like these conquerors of the world well we talk more about companies than we do about people like Ben and David Center over at Founders or companies yeah or companies I mean it's the classic like being contrarian and right and you have to be both contrarian and right but the people that were studying and the companies that we're studying are such extreme outliers like they're such the they're four standard deviations from the mean in terms of like how did a company do and so they were they're sort of like an N of one like there's one tsmc in the world there's one lvmh who owns all the most valuable luxury Brands except Hermes uh and it sort of happens in a unique way every time and so I guess the the biggest takeaway for me is like it usually is the founder doing something that like literally everybody else had left for dead and and when I say that I mean like Bernard or no going and buying Christian Dior from the French government out of bankruptcy in when was that the 80s David 80s yeah or like literally no one else was bidding on this like dead asset or uh the the example for starting tsmc is like zero other people thought that you should be starting a Foundry when you have no chip IP to make other people's chip designs like that was there were zero other people like there is no there is no formula every story is unique but a big big category is like something that has been left for dead for like sometimes it's inventing something new whole cloth but like really big category is like oh this thing is over and over David Nintendo yeah Nintendo Google video game Crash of 1983 like the market for video games in the United States went from three billion dollars to a hundred million dollars over the course of two years everybody was running screaming from the industry and they thought oh video games were a fad and it's over and then you have Nintendo that comes in launches the NES and then within five years has 95 market share and has grown the industry back to a three billion dollar industry it's these like Nut Job bets has that has that like given you guys any confidence to succeed do you think like because John and I talked to all these awesome people and like we'll talk to there are a handful of people and I said this a bunch there's a handful of people who we talk to and we say oh you're definitely like significantly smarter than we are or you're you're significant you have this part that's more significant than us and then there's other people who we'll talk to that are worth hundreds of millions or billions of dollars and it's like well you're not like 20 times smarter than us even though you're 20 times richer but like you might be a little bit or sometimes a little bit less and that's given us confidence at least me for sure because I'm like oh you definitely are insecure you uh question yourself you doubt yourself but you still went through with it it's a good question like I know how to be contrarian I'm not sure I know how to be right yet like we're halfway there baby yeah yeah exactly like I I I you know we know how to make everyone tells you you should make short podcasts that release every single week and you should have guests on to help build your audio and we do basically none of those things and everything that has worked for us is doing the exact opposite of those and so does that mean keep doing the opposite of every piece of advice everyone gives you because that's the path to success I don't think so but if we overfit to the data that we've observed so far that is what it would look like and so I'm hesitant to like keep being contrarian for the sense of being contrarian but but I think that the important part that comes with this is like having a iterative feedback loop with your customers or in our case with our listeners to understand like what makes you love this and how do we lean harder into that and and sort of shut out general advice and pay more attention to like the the things our customers are expressing by the way I've picked up a little poker tell on people who are uncontract how do you tell a real contrarian versus a wannabe contrarian this is a hotel I picked up over time which is yeah yeah uh in the tech world I think because of Peter Thiel there's this like kind of like real sex appeal to fetishization contrary and uh if you put in your Twitter bio you're probably not it yeah exactly same with polymath yeah polymath's another one of them um as being or Visionary as being as me and Sam have joked about like or like if you're an engineer being like slightly on the Spectrum it's like oh yeah yeah that's another indicator of success it's like here we go the one that is I think a tell when it comes to being contrarian is how excited are you that you have this contrarian idea because that shows people who are contrarian for the sake of being contrarian meaning like they're really excited to tell you how they think everybody else thinks a but it's actually B um whereas the real people I've seen that are contrarian they just see a and they're almost like I'm confused why people don't think a a is clearly right um uh they don't spend time trying to like convince the whole world of it like you know if if they're asked they tell the truth and then when people react in a big way like oh man I can't believe you think that and they're like I can't believe you don't think that um it just seems like the truth to them and so that's what I've noticed is like if you if you watch old videos of like you know Peter teal talking or like I think biology is somebody who's like this today um they SP they they're happy to explain their point of view and they explain it like this is just what's gonna happen or this is what I believe to be true but they don't um get high on the idea of of being a contrarian it's a subtle difference there's a bunch of people I've met in real life that that I kind of I've noticed this on it's hard to explain but you'll see next time you kind of run into somebody who's over eager and over excited about the fact that they have this contrarian opinion it's they're kind of just performing socially versus they actually believe that it reminds me a lot of um it's like we all know this guy or girl who likes the idea of a relationship more than they like their current relationship and they're they're very excited to like have this particular lifestyle and you can sort of tell you're into that new lifestyle you have more than the person you're actually with right so right did you want a boyfriend or did you want Ben right like who did you actually want to hear um yeah let me tell a story it's interesting though like okay I was just gonna tell one on the thing Sam you talked about like what are the interesting success patterns um it reminded me of an experience I had uh a while back I went to China when I was maybe 21 years old and got to go to the Alibaba like Alibaba flew out a bunch of entrepreneurs to go like meet with it was supposed to be Jack ma but we ended up meeting with this guy David way who's like their Jack Ma's right hand man he was the guy who was running Alibaba at the time and I didn't even know what Alibaba was like Alibaba was a big deal like now and now I'm like now I would have taken that really seriously I I had no idea who they were at the time and we get there and somebody asked him this question they raise their hand they go what do you think is the most important things for Success uh for the success of a company Alibaba is a multi-billion dollar company um you know what what made it successful and he goes um he goes models for Success are misleading they cannot be copied due to the like unique combination of luck timing all these other things but he goes but what you can ask me is a better question which is what are the common keys to failure and he goes they're always the same and he goes we study the things that lead to failure and just try to avoid those so he goes uh you know I leaned in I was like please blow my mind sir go ahead yeah and he's like um he goes there's three things that lead to failure money plans a technology he goes so our plan was no money no plans no technology and I go what and like this is crazy because like a tech company worth like 40 billion dollars like what are you talking about and he goes hey he goes all right here we go money money makes people stupid and when problems come up their first instinct becomes throw money at it rather than attacking it with creativity so basically way back when Google was uh Google was like dominating with AdWords and so they're the people at Alibaba were like we need to make our version of AdWords and he goes you know this is no it's like you know building this type of AD network is not like super simple um he goes so Jack ma cut a check for 250 000 to build this project and latim like laughed like you're you're missing three zeros on the back of this like what are you talking about 250k and he goes That's how much money it took me to start Alibaba um like I I had less than that starting the whole company so if you need more than that for a feature we're doing it wrong he's like they're like well how are we supposed to do this he goes do exactly what I did with Alibaba he's like so he moved 19 people into his apartment where he had started out he's like that's your office you're gonna work there he's like you need uh servers to run the ad servers cool go find some like uh go get some used junk servers and like re-rig them get them refurbish them and make them work and they go but there's no redundancy he goes if you're building within where you need redundancy like we've we've done this wrong right like uh you know this is you need to build build this so that it works without redundancy first and um and so he he did that for that was the no money then he's like no technology he's like everybody wants to call us at tech company no we are a Service Company we're here to serve our users if you don't think of yourself like you're in the service industry you're in the wrong industry and uh this last one was planned and it's like all right well dude how'd you do this like why no plans why are plans bad he goes um he goes well you know you guys are 50 young entrepreneurs who got flown out here to do this I I assume in America you guys have done something good otherwise why would we have picked you he goes how many of you are doing what you initially plan to do and like nobody's hand went up and he was like exactly and he goes uh plan is plans are fine but they always change that's the only thing we know about plans the mission never wavers sometimes you'll need a plan to get others to believe but remember you should not believe that plan you should follow your gut and adapt constantly to the circumstances don't follow the plan you wrote when you started follow your mission follow your vision follow the why if you do that you will be successful and I was like damn dude did you write all this down so so many years ago after that after that event I wrote I tried to write a book in like two weeks and I wrote half of it and so this was one of my chapters in that book uh and I just found the PDF on my computer when you were talking about awesome that's hilarious that's amazing that you did that because that was years ago what a great story it's so applicable I love that that's applicable to Alibaba uh just as much as like I'm thinking about you guys and us and like how we started the conversation like yeah we had no money we had I guess we had technology in that like podcasting and the internet is inherently one of us were like we're building a tech company or we're building a product it was like no it's like something and we have no plan and like it's funny like I we see a lot I'm sure you guys do too people come to us like oh how do I start a podcast I start a successful podcast we see like big companies come the like offline celebrities that want to start podcasts and it's like they come with money technology and a play out and they're like it's not how it's gonna work that it's gonna suck you guys probably see this with your episodes like how many of them started doing what they're doing like I don't know I haven't listened to all the recent ones but like I don't know was Nintendo what were you thinking of Nintendo today or did it dude Nintendo was making wait wait real quick do either of you know the origin story of Nintendo or or have a guess at how old Nintendo is I think it's really I remember reading it once I don't I don't remember off top of my head but it was is it like Sony where they were like selling rice or something and then now they're who they are it's even better yeah it's a 130 year old company 89 I think yeah and their original business was making hanafuda cards which is the Japanese version of us playing cards but U.S playing cards were illegal to import like because people from the US could were it was not legal to be in the country and David I think you at this point they literally would execute you yeah you came in well Nintendo started straight after this but before the metis restoration like Japan went through this multi-hundred year period of strict isolationism where like you would be executed if you were a foreigner and you entered the country likewise if you were a Japanese person and you left the country and came back you would also be executed like um and but like playing cards are this thing that like has product Market fits they're like how do we gamble things like playing cards Universal human need so it literally started making hanafuda cards and their distribution channel was through the Yakuza to Illegal casinos yeah Yakuza being like the Mafia the Japanese Mafia yeah yeah they started making these playing cards and like if very small part of the market was like oh you have a pack of playing cards in your house but just like everywhere else in the world the market is casinos because you use a fresh deck for each hand so that there's no cheating and yeah so Nintendo is like deeply embedded with the Yakuza and for like 60 years this was their business before they started making toys wow and then what some like Visionary within the company was like uh hey there's this new thing crazy family like really tragedy of like this cycle of um death and uh just like terrible parenting in the past down to four generations of the same family but actually not the same family because they had no sons and they needed Sun so they were marrying their daughters off to people who could take over the business yeah exactly and uh one of these guys was basically just like so pissed off at like the family Legacy that uh this is Hiroshi Yamauchi who started the modern Nintendo uh and he was like and he wanted to First buy the business I want to get out of this and he did a partnership with Disney in 1959 yeah 1959 he Nintendo brought Disney and Disney IP into Japan post World War II check this out I literally have the cards as toys acquired fans sent them to me oh wow started words yeah and then they brought toys and then they started making their own toys because they had like lock on the retail Distributors uh yeah wow so it started his cards and they were like then they went said all these uh retailers they were like oh you want the Disney products you're gonna take our products too was that Jiminy Cricket as the Joker Jiminy Cricket as the Joker in Mickey Mouse golfing on this old school card deck that's amazing that's like you gotta wear that with you gotta wear gloves if you're gonna touch that or something that's like a seriously ancient artifact this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better can I ask you guys a couple rapid fire questions uh about some of the companies that you've you've discussed number one which company of all of everyone that you've uh won over would you want to own like which one what's the one that you envy well that way those are two different questions which would you want to okay like own the stock of and which do you want or which do you want to like uh be an investor in or actually own the company yeah yeah the second actually own and which one do you envy most actually own I think is the NFL yeah I think that has the most like durable franchise and own is always a funny question because what's your entry price like do I have to buy stuff at today's prices or but if I think about sort of like durability of the asset and I sort of ignore um where things are trading and what Market values today the NFL is seven layers of entrenched in our society and to be an American at this point means to have the NFL in your life and they also David you pointed this out on our episode everyone thinks it's really cute to like stack rank all the media franchises Marvel's worth this and you know all the way at the top of the charts Pokemon's worth this but like the NFL is worth so much more than any of those the NFL TV contract alone is 12 billion dollars a year the most recent set of Rights they parsled up was like no isn't it uh now it's like 18 or 19 billion a year I think something insane but then they recently signed a 10-year deal so it's like a 150 billion dollar deal NFL has all the franchises but is there basically like this like top level hold Co that owns like the media rights and the franchise it's communist capitalism they all own it all together but the NFL unlike any of the other leagues out there is this is there's starting to be a few little cracks in this but like they didn't negotiate with the TV contracts and now all the streaming and everything unified as a league so there's no like you know like how the Yankees have the Yes Network like their own TV Network it's none of that in the NFL it's all together and it's all equal Revenue share have you guys done an episode on MLB am yes it's actually the first investment before the acquisition these guys can tell you the the full version they're accurate version I'll give you the dumb version which is the Major League Baseball had created a tech like a tech team basically a tech company inside of Major League Baseball co-owned by like the the teams and the good job was like Hey like people are trying to listen to this on the radio we need to like do Digital streaming audio Ichiro because when Ichiro came over from Japan they needed to stream remember that guy Sam Ichiro Suzuki the guy who played on the Mariners yeah yeah it was like a phenomenon and so people in Japan wanted to watch or watch wasn't even an option I think it was listen to the games so they needed Digi internet streaming audio and so they built this thing they started offering here then each team would use it so it's like oh each team co-funded it so they would like cut a check and then that developed technology for all of them but then they ended up spinning it out as a multi-billion dollar company because they're the best at video streaming now like they stream if you want to watch Game of Thrones it's MLB am's video tech that streams Game of Thrones so that when whatever 10 million people click play as soon as the episode drops that like the thing doesn't crash which is kind of a you know just an amazing thing and so that like spin out oh like who would have ever thought like one of the big tech companies you know unicorn tech companies came out of like this baseball Co-op co-funded thing is that kind of an insane story and it was in like 2004 or something that they started working on it they had a five-year head start on having the Insight that this infrastructure was going to be important over Netflix like everyone thinks like oh Netflix you know is in with the isps and it's the best in the world that this like damn Tech was doing that five years earlier yeah and it ended up getting acquired by Disney and like is a huge part of ESPN streaming like all the um ESPN plus plus Disney plus like it's it's crazy the history is there is there a certain founder CEO leader who you would rank as the the person you'd least want to compete against whether they're whether historical or modern here's another phrasing that I heard that I like there's somebody who's talking about the NFL draft and there's like four QBs that were competing and they're like wow this guy's got good arm this guy's good at running this guy's a great leader blah blah and then this guy asked this question I loved he goes let's say they all went on vacation and they rented a car and they're walking out to the to the Jeep who do they throw the keys to to drive this car it's like who's the leader who's the alpha amongst Alphas amongst these QB so so who's that in the CEO I think we gotta say Jensen uh Jensen long from Nvidia like he's such a badass so like I don't know anything about Nvidia because I just know it's a killer stock so Nvidia makes the chips that are in computers and and does it involves display like you can get like a Nvidia yeah is that right yeah is uh is in their sort of third major act as a company yeah but Loosely defined as like they um popularized the idea of a GPU in addition to the CPU and originally the use case was for video games in the 90s and you know I think everyone who ever built PCS remembers like oh man I gotta get this hot new GPU to slide in the card because it's better than the integrated Graphics thing from Intel um and so that was sort of their market for a while and uh it was all about gaming PCs but then like again five six seven years before the rest of the Market Jensen basically made this bet where he saw researchers using the the gpus the gaming Graphics they're really going to Best Buy and buying a bunch of Nvidia graphics cards to do AI research and he was like I think we should lean really heavily into this and so he spent billions of dollars and thousands of head count for five years to build up this like whole software stack called cuda that if Ai and ml was going to become a thing then people were going to use Cuda to develop exclusively on nvidia's hardware and so by the time it did become a thing like five years ago Nvidia had this enormous moat around it as being the platform to develop AI on and it just so happened that the technology this like super heavy parallel processing Matrix math technology that makes gaming Graphics chips work is the very same math that powers what ml is all based on but other than so Nvidia for The Listener it's I just looked it up it says 650 billion dollar company so one of the I don't know top 20 30 biggest business in the world but other than him being correct what makes this person like a savage or that they're just like there's so many points in history like he is uh 19 wives let me no he actually he's a total family man he's been married to the same person he met in college if two kids like he's uh but like he's got a giant tattoo of the company's logo on his shoulder uh he wears leather jackets he drives really fast cars he's like um like Elon except not like like right like right and like leads with kindness and uh but like he I mean they're like in each phase of the company the absolute rational thing to do was like basically shut it down and like you know like talk about being left for dead like this company was left for dead multiple times and he's built like just single-handedly this dude created the AI Revolution that we are in today like Nvidia and Cuda is essentially like you can think about it as like the Android plus iOS of AI like no Nvidia and no Cuda no decision by Jensen to do this we are not living in the world we're living in today a different answer for the thing you're actually looking for which is like who is the most Savage person to compete against that answer is Bernardo uh and he got there not by being the founder of a business that happened to have product Market fit and appreciated wildly it's because of his deal prowess and the way that he was able to effectively outsmart the rest of the market to Hoover up 70 of the the history's most important and trusted Brands into one umbrella and then find leverage in every single thing he does to expand the Empire is there anyone who you think is overrated who's on a pedestal and you think I don't think that person's that great I think it worked out but I think they're overrated it's a very unacquired question we'll see Dave and I are nice people we are we don't um well pick a Deadpool one that I like to I like to talk about it uh damn person uh or you can pick anyone but someone who's like no I think one that I like to talk about here is um I don't know the overrated is right but like I I think a lot about it investing about um there's this great Buffett quote not one of his most well-known ones but um uh it's something like you wanna own a business that uh you know even an idiot could run because someday someone will you know and I think about uh uh to me what that means is like you want to own a business you want to invest in a business that like literally you cannot kill it there's nothing you can do to stop this Juggernaut uh and to me that's Airbnb and we talked about this a lot on the episode we did on airbnbly it's just like the most amazing Global Network effect of all time and literally like I don't you know this is my opinion but I don't think there's anything that any manager could do to change the like to inflect the trajectory of that ship you know so my uh I uh I like there's a long story I don't feel like telling it but I had a job at Airbnb when I was like 22 and I like dropped out of school and moved out and then I got denied whatever so I didn't end up working there but I got to interview with the founders and then years later my wife ended up working there and during work from home for covid Brian would give these talks every Thursday and we lived in a small apartment so I like inevitably would hear it I think that I agree with you it's a mark once you have a Marketplace that's working it's hard to screw it up eBay is doing a good job though but uh you know if it works like it's a good it's a great thing it's a quite durable but I would listen to Brian chesky give these 30 minute like Thursday talks that guy is Bad to the Bone I read a little bit I read the Walsh uh the Walt Disney biography and he reminded me exactly of him he is a you know like I think someone said there's a difference between a missionary and a mercenary mercenaries are Hired Guns who are ruthless but missionaries they really care about what they're doing I I sense that with him that guy I think is uh is is a bit killer I think that he's uh people think of him as this nice guy of which I think he is I think he's way way more of a killer than people give him credit for and he's very wise that he's a really good leader um but that's cool I like Airbnb and I think it and I think it's cool that I agree that it probably would be um hard to kill and last question which person who you covered would you would kick your ass physically and you'd at least want to have a physical confrontation with I mean actually Jensen yeah you think he you think you think so well he's getting another age but like yeah no he like he lifts uh he's just like such a character uh uh well I certainly I mean we're coming right off of Nintendo but like um Hiroshi yamuchi back in the day not because he was physically intimidating but like literally like that the man was in bed with the Yakuza oh they oh you did not cross him yeah like we sat Dave and I walked in to interview douglioni it's a great story and uh dougone is the founder of Sequoia yeah managing partner yeah got it a head honcho at one point of one of the best uh Venture Capital firms ever through Google and you know the the true Heyday of Sequoia which or you could argue that was recently but amazing era of Sequoia and uh so we a lot of times like with guests we'll get to like spend some time beforehand and get to know them and go out to dinner afterwards and build real relationship and we like email or text and you guys know the drill and so with with Doug we uh we didn't communicate with him at all beforehand it was all with uh some some other lovely people at Sequoia and we walk in and we set up and someone walks in the room and then they go okay are you um are you ready and we were like like yep and they were like great we'll go get Doug walks in he sits down he says hello are we starting and we're like uh yeah so we hit record and we feel like so we did a whole episode right Doug just goes great thank you so much and he walk gets up and leaves the room so every word that I've ever spoken with with Douglas except for like two or three is on the record in the episode that you can listen to on our podcast feed and uh later his EA did come in and say hey Doug wanted to know if you guys had any feedback he's always looking to get better um and and sort of like came and Shadow with us but I was like wow that is uh that is not uttered by Ben or me quoting somebody else from history uh but the best live quote unacquired he was talking about um after the.com crash when uh Sequoia was like kind of made this vow that no LP would lose money like they wouldn't take a mulligan fund they would like work the portfolio of companies they don't take salaries make sure that they have positive returns and they said uh he's like Mike Moritz and I linked arms or it wasn't I think it was LinkedIn he said Mike Moritz and I decided that like we would stand there and we wouldn't Flinch and you could burn cigarettes on our arms and we would like if we wouldn't take a mulligan on these funds like damn he also has kind of an accent right like he's uh he's got this Italian New York Vibe yeah that's cool well are there are there any more of these like tough guys or tough women like that are out there now I mean when I hear that it's I always think like oh that was a different generation nowadays is still like this yeah yeah Frank uh my my badge is not working to get into the office he's still got teeth don't you he's like you know that's like when you read that guy's book you're like all right yeah this would be a pretty hardcore boss to work under yeah it's totally a lost art though like um yeah I don't I don't think they make them like that anymore unfortunately yeah um that's crazy before we go do you guys have uh have any half-baked business ideas you wanted to share with the uh the my first million audience because uh that's what they love uh yeah I would love to do this so I have one that uh I was we were actually kicking around uh together Ben and me for a while um but that we're not gonna do which is I think uh you could actually start a corporate podcast agency so an agency for companies to make their own internal podcast or external either one uh and my thesis on this is that for companies uh there is tremendous value to having a podcast even if nobody listens if people listen like upside but even basically you should just assume no one will listen because we have like ever there's so many great options why would I listen to a company's podcast right but it is an excuse to have relationship building conversations with customers sales and Biz Dev basically yeah exactly it's it's sales enablement like once you have a conversation you have it recorded you publish it publicly even if there's no organic audience you can still link to that and you can send it to customers as like a lead nurturing thing of oh somebody else was in this position too and they talked about why our product made their life better right right yeah like what do Salesforce should have its own uh its own its own podcast yeah what do they charge for that what do people charge for that I know Ben uh Ben are Ben Ben Wilson used to look work at UH is it mission.org Ben or no it was Caspian Caspian Studios and I think they do that foreign does this idea work or not really what what's the verdict on this one yes it works yes the customers are extremely price insensitive so it's good the margins are super high uh we actually like combining the two things we just talked about we made snowflakes podcast and Frank sloopment was about it all the time oh perfect so it's uh it's a really good business the one bad thing about it that's coming into effect right now is when recessions hit it's the first thing to go right it's just like the margins are super good when times are good but then when times are not the email you're being like hey can you send me the last 30 day downloads numbers and you're like delete yeah delete the whole podcast get rid of it they're they're asking the question yes yeah what else you got what else interests you at the moment Ben you got any uh or at least what deals are you seeing because you guys are investing are there any interesting deals that you're seeing or categories that you're seeing that you really like that don't start with the word AI I mean actually no like and and I think that's the I think that is correct like I am one of these people that believes that uh saying AI we invest in AI is a little bit of a silly thing these days because it's the same thing as 20 years ago saying we invest in software as if you see it's like yeah no like I I think it's just gonna be so quickly ubiquitous that like if companies aren't using AI in some capacity or starting to get a little bit like what's a cool AI use case or company that you've that you've seen and invested in or want to invest in whatever well and by the way I think Sean met with James Currier recently and I think it was James on Twitter or maybe Sean Hughes told us you go I've been pitched by 200 AI companies in the last quarter and I've invested in none because they're all weak or something like that so I haven't it's interesting I haven't invested in any either or I haven't invested lots of companies I've invested in have added AI stuff to their products but I haven't invested in some like net new AI company in part because I don't think AI is going to be the differentiation and I don't think it's going to be defensible for the vast majority of companies I think the the value is going to come from and the moat is going to come from the same thing that always creates value and modes which is like uh Network effects with your customers or like a data mode where someone's already fully locked into your thing and so they don't want to migrate because that would suck and they have processes around using your thing uh and so I sort of like I I believe that an enormous amount of the value from AI will accrue to these foundational models but you actually do have to be using the foundational models in your thing in order to be uh like table stakes in in the next few years because everybody's going to expect all software to just behave magically right do you think and this will be the last question for me do you think that there's a world where you're going to sell acquired or do one of these Spotify deals or anything like that oh have you been approached good question uh yes but not uh not in like a um not in not recently and not in a way that like not since we've become a real business uh what could you get for it you think like Daddy I think could be trying to give him five million bucks but they said no quibby oh wow we would say no to that we would for sure say no to that um I don't like if uh we could talk about like I I don't uh uh I would not be interested in having any conversations for you know less than uh you know on the order of like what you got like the hustle or um uh morning Brew or you know stuff like that tens of millions yeah yeah yeah uh I mean I just think like the value of what we've built both as a business and revenue and our audience uh and our durability is you know is is in that category I think it's very much an open question like it's gotten so much bigger than we ever imagined how much farther can it go uh right I'm curious how these things would we trust our own underwriting more than an acquirer's underwriting because what has happened for us is it has doubled every single year for eight years basically no matter what we do like we can't make it grow faster or slower than that uh right yeah it's it's cash generative yeah have you guys built any businesses off the back of it no I'm thinking kindergarten um so I have a fund on Angel list I manage about 30 million dollars of capital on Angelus between two funds and four or five spvs um and while I used to be a professional VC before going full-time unacquired and that certainly helps um all of that's because of acquired like and you uh so so you did that you did that fund um anything else that you guys have done that you've launched uh off the back of it because what we found was that podcast like you said it's very hard to make it grow faster than it's kind of like natural Word of Mouth virality in interest and like kind of the Tam of that that market um like that Andrew hubermans are rare normally It's a Grind yeah yeah and uh and even him I don't think he can make it grow much faster or slower just like good execution is obviously the only thing you control but like a lot of people can do good execution and their growth rate will be easier somewhat uh uh linear you know it's not gonna like get much fat the slope doesn't change that much do you um but the thing that I think what we found was that you could build businesses off the back of this audience whether it's a fund or other other products or services that can be more valuable than the ad revenue of the business of the podcast itself do you guys do that or think about that like Sean well Sean mentioned a company and they're like oh we just did a million in revenue and he's like oh well I I gave a company a plug that I invested in I was like hey I use it for this reason blah blah you know an ad basically but it wasn't meant to be an ad I was just explaining how I use this thing and they booked a million dollars of ARR off of uh off of that which was like pretty crazy yeah so so that happens to us all the time uh which is why all of our sponsor deals are these like six-figure very meaningful um and long term we do these six month sponsorships uh and most of our sponsors are now you know three four five seasons and like it works and so the question is is it more is the right mode for us to operate in keep doing these big deep sponsorship deals with companies for cash or do we try to start companies or uh find some company that's at an inflection point and say you know let's trade Equity or um I think we're pretty early in the thinking there because we're like uh you know we would have to it would have to be really the right type of company that is a high LTV B2B SAS business that's reaching Founders and and uh you know CEOs and Technical Founders and that would have to be the audience like I don't think we're gonna launch an energy drink brand and have that make have that kind of pencil but I don't know we're open to the possibility I think there's also for us I'm curious how you guys think about it because you are getting into this game uh I at least I don't want to speak for Ben I don't want to run a company I want to make tell stories and invest uh uh so I don't really want to build products or manage teams uh so I think it's likely that we'll continue going that route I don't know Ben has experience actually building things so you may feel differently but this lets us benefit from the upside of companies using acquired as Channel without us have to be involved in the muck of building that company yeah and maybe at some point that our desire will change there but how do you guys you guys have built companies you guys are building products like how you think about this I've thought about it both ways like I I'm like you a little bit where my I have the most fun when I get to just tell you know tell stories nerd out about stuff go learn new things and then come back with like go I want to go down rabbit holes and then take that most interesting you know one percent of things that I found and shared on this podcast or on my newsletter um and that's that's what I like to do that's the sort of highest enjoyment uh but I also love money and so I'm like okay cool and I also like the thing I study is about how people make money in business and create wealth and so I can't help myself but like apply some of the things that I learned like it's it's very hard to resist the urge to apply the things that you know once you know them yeah and um but then you got to go recruiter like basically played with every form you could do so I I invest both in startups as well as like cash flowing businesses like I'll buy you know 20 30 of a cash flowing business that I think I can help through the audience or uh or just through like you know being an entrepreneur for 15 years and like learning a bunch of stuff um the second thing would be starting a business so I started the milk Road off of the podcast I think the podcast helped us get the ball rolling there um and then you know I've launched the courses or things like that that just are ways to to take the Curiosity and say oh I learned a bunch of stuff could I teach it um and then and and I also thought about you know you know so buying businesses investing in startups uh doing uh building a startup on their own or not doing any of them not being operational at all like I've played with kind of all of them over the past three years in different ways like we sold the milk Road in part because okay that business is working and we got a great offer but the the best part of the offer was oh I don't have to operate any business anymore if I do this um that's appealing to me whereas Sam just launched Hampton last week or I think was that last week I saw congratulations thank you I feel like you don't have to do sales for the next year based off of like you know the the blitz that you were able to to drum up across the Pod Twitter everywhere everywhere that you tried to do right like I mean you could talk a little more about that but it seems like yeah so you crushed your demand side Yeah so basically in 2022 and 21 I was inspired by Sean I was like all right fine I'll invest a little while and so I gave it like a six to 12 month try and I was like I hate investing um I totally dislike it um I think maybe I could be pretty good at it but I I it's not for me I don't like taking a minority interest in things that's um I personally like owning all of something and I think of myself a little bit as an artist sometimes with these companies like it's like my I like to be creative and that's kind of how I like to express myself so I prefer that with and so that's why I launched Hampton was because I was like this fits my interest there I have a competitive Advantage here and so when I announced it uh on the Pod we now have 5 000 people who applied and we're like and it that's it's cost 8 500 a year to join and we're being very meticulous and very slow about who we're adding but that's very likely going to be a very very large company I think we have a CEO Jordan who's amazing but uh like we're not taking any outside capital and I prefer Sean likes to do lots of things and I know a lot of people like to do that lots of things and I know a lot of people who succeed really nicely with that me personally I prefer focus and just doing one thing at a time because I I don't I just my brain it's really challenging for me to jump from thing to think of thing like an investor needs to and so I prefer like spending five ten years on something and so I I intend to start company uh start a company maybe another one in a handful of years I'm not sure rather than investing I actually think that Sean's way of like doing cash flow businesses and owning a portion of them that's actually the easier way I think to make wealth um I I just don't find enjoyment on it I'm a dopamine fiend and like seeing sales come in and like making decisions I get like it's it's my alcohol I like getting drunk off that how do you think about the business of the Pod of my first million so the podcast is owned by HubSpot and we get paid we get paid strictly a performance fee and so when it kicks ass which it has we get paid good money as if we have had advertisers yeah um and so but hubspot's been great like not one time have they ever censored us or said hey you made a bad joke don't say that and so it's been pretty good it is there's definitely I wouldn't say complicated but it's a new relationship that we're definitely trying to figure out of like what to do because frankly hubspot's an awesome partner but at the same time if Sean and I bounce they they don't have right so I think we're both both sides of that of that are trying to understand what we can do and how far we can push things and and we're definitely start figuring that out there are you have some and they're probably are potentially more monetization options for the Pod right like how does that Revenue get split up uh like uh YouTube ads I mean we just don't we uh turned off YouTube ads we can't like if somebody wants to sponsor it we don't right so like we leave a lot of money on the table in that regard um but you get other benefits right so you got to like kind of bring those out over time and be like right so yeah like the benefit the benefits that we have are basically we don't do any of the work so we record and then it goes on the internet um that's a pro and a con because if we don't like how it's done then it's like we don't like that let's fix it but as long as it's working well it's awesome we get paid without having to have any expenses but then the flip side is we have all these this Advertiser interest and we know it works really well let's take more deals and so I think there's a there's a world where we do kind of actually come to a compromise and we have more ads but uh that's like it's a it's a conversation yeah yeah is there is there attention at all with you guys wanting to use the Pod to do stuff that generates value for yourself that doesn't accrue back to the MFM pod like you launching businesses off it or is that no they're they're they're they're they're they're great with that and any Revenue outside of the Pod is 100 ours events merch whatever but let's say that they're like we're hiring a producer now because Ben's gonna go full time on his uh new thing let's say let's yeah congratulations Ben let's say that uh they're moving slow it's like hey guys HubSpot hurry the hell up you know you're going way too slow I got five friends right now who could hire and so like there's tension there for things like that yeah well probably all all the business activity all the stuff you guys are launching outside of the Pod just brings attention back to the Pod right so like it also brings credibility because how many yeah people do you see on YouTube or Tick Tock or Twitter wherever that are like you know basically these bit like business gurus or like you know advice guys right if you hear the advice guys so you like click their bio and you're like so what have you done what do you do oh your career is giving advice okay but where'd you get that firsthand knowledge do you have any Battle Scars like Oh no you're you know you're the bald Barber uh oh great like you know I'm not sure that I want I'm not sure that I want that right so so I think that's also helpful right because if like bald Barber by the way chef's kiss thank you good job I'm practicing my my improv on the Fly I decided to take a few more risks of like oh man T up that I'm gonna make the joke and see if my brain in that 0.5 seconds could come up with something and if I if I fall flat you know two out of three times that's okay that's still one exactly um so yeah basically I think it gets credibility right like during the pod um you know I built the milk Road and sold it during like while the Pod was live so that adds some credibility during the Pod Sam launches Hampton it's clearly gonna be successful we're already already off to a successful start it gives the Pod credibility and I think that's why like why does all learn work really well like obviously the good banter they have good things to say but I think a big part of it is like they bring a certain gravity to the room because they're participating in the story as it's unfair like the easiest way I explained is all in is billionaires talk about billionaire and my first millionaire in my first million is millionaires talking about millionaires like and I've heard people like college kids come out be like we're broke guys talking about broke guys that's like all right yeah like that's that's the way to go but I think it adds credibility because there's a lot of people out there who will create content tell you about the next big thing but they don't invest they don't have skin in the game they don't know actually what's going on or they'll tell you you know how to be successful and they're you know broken depressed so it's like you got to be careful with who you listen to It's like I'd rather listen to somebody who's done it before than somebody who hasn't it's just as simple as that yep yep what's that I think is the whole unlock of podcasting that like is a problem with the traditional media industry like one of the uh it wasn't explicitly in my our minds when we started acquired but like I'd gone to Business School uh I went to Stanford I did my MBA there it was a great experience but like the classroom experience like the professors not the guests who would come in who had done stuff but like the professors who were full-time academics and then the cases that we would do just be like you guys didn't do this like why are you telling me about this like I want to hear from the people who did it and the journalists that cover the tech industry it's like how many people going from being successful Founders to entering the journalism industry and writing for a paper like a few like Michael Michael morowitz by the way Michael morowitz you know uh Doug Leone's partner Moretz yeah sorry Morris he uh journalist turned billionaire yeah and uh yes yeah yeah yeah sorry the reverse pipeline doesn't exist so like yeah I always have to remind myself of this when I'm reading Tech coverage I'm like okay the the very best ones of these people have immersed themselves in the operator founder communities to be able to like pick up the genesequa and read between the lines of what certain things mean like Dan primac is one of these types of people but you know a a junior journalist coming out of Journalism School writing and picking up this beat it's like I it's hard to say that that's a better way to learn what's going on than listening to people who are industry participants talking about what's going on I remember once I went to a journalist uh somebody who worked at TechCrunch I went to their apartment in San Francisco and I just like walked in and I looked around and I was like this is the same apartment as like everybody I know right out of college has and I was like and then they have this pen and then they write on TechCrunch and then it looks like very different but like this is a person who's just a no they're a normal person who this is kind of like their first gig and they're covering something that they barely like really true honestly they barely understand that doesn't mean they're not smart doesn't mean they don't have good intentions but like it's that thing where I forget the name of it but it's like if you read an article about a topic you actually know about in the newspaper you're like oh this is oh okay I see the limitations of how much stock I should put into this but when you read them on topic you don't know you're like this is the truth oh the New York Times is an expert and it's like there's a problem what it's called right do you guys remember a few years ago when one of the I think her name was Jen or something like that one of the founders of Away Travel like there was all these headlines saying like this woman created a toxic workplace that's horrible you gotta get I was like oh is this a juicy story let's dig in where's the fraud I love when you read the you read the messages that they're publishing listen to this yeah startup so someone like packed like she like opened up a package and it was horribly done and she said if this keeps or what did she say she goes I'm just gonna have to pack these boxes myself because whoever's running this must be brain dead and I was like okay cool let's scroll where's the good stuff yeah they're like that's the thing she said no we're brain dead I'm like that's the toxic work environment like come on give me a break that that ain't nice but that's not New York Times headlines give me a break like I want to see something finally for that right something like that she bounced because of that like that it wasn't interested The Other Woman not yeah I forget what her name was uh but like I read that article I'm like there's no fraud like she didn't you know like there's no alcohol involved what's going on give me something good I want cocaine and hookers I don't want brain dead yeah you know what I'm saying at least like this is why there's so much value to like what you guys are doing that your building businesses and talking about them that like we're investing Ben's a full-time VC I used to be like we know what's going on in a way that if you're just a journalist like you can't it's structurally impossible well podcasts actually have more people from the field that come in and do it because a podcast is easier you're talking you're not writing there's no barrier you don't have to like edit and like you know make a cool fancy Tick Tock thing you know you don't have to like layer in filters and stuff it's just you sit down you talk that's why you see like Reed Hoffman we'll do a straight up audio medium yeah just like straight audio um or even audio with the webcam like you know now I think that's getting a little bit easier but basically the podcast format I think there's a reason why you see somebody like X athletes do this or like you know the same thing like you have Skip Bayless who will just go say how this person is they don't have the clutch Gene it's like bro that's not a gene um you know they they you know and he'll just like he'll make fun of people and then you have JJ Redick who's an ex-player old man of the three so he's phenomenal that content his and his point of view is so much better than there's and that's why his stock is going up like his views are just going up and to the right because he's good at this he pulls real gas when he pulls real guests they talk like they don't talk like they're talking to a reporter because they played with JJ or they played against him so they actually open up about stuff but he's also not trying to trap him in these gotcha questions so there's like some mutual trust there and then he'll just share like you know when you're a player on the road like you know this is the situation fans think you're practicing and blah blah blah but actually here's what happens when you go and he's just saying what's what's really going on and so to me when you see that and again it's because podcasting is a lot easier if you told him hey I need you to write like beautiful well-written blog posts every other day it'd be very hard to do but for him to just oh something happened get on the microphone give my point of view they could do it so like you get more credible experts in podcasting than I think on any other like medium this is probably actually a good use of AI is being able to turn the ramblings of people who are industry participants you run that transcript through and you say write this as if it was a New York Times article with a strong lead and you know this many words like it is amazing uh how I feel like I've transformed in my use of GPT over the last month where I was using it to try to answer questions which it's fine at but of course that's the first thing you're going to do with a prompt but my use case recently has been take lots of stuff and feed it in as the prompt and then ask it to make it better so like I wrote a LinkedIn post about our most recent acquired episode and I fed it I've just pasted the whole thing into chat GPT I was like can you make this like more exciting and can you make this more likely to go viral and like is that literally said so you basically copy and pasted 500 Words you said here's a LinkedIn post I wrote make it more exciting let me see exactly what the prompt was so I don't BS on the Pod here okay no one can check say I can you please act as my editor and modify this to make it more likely to go viral as a LinkedIn post that's so funny and it indexed way in the other direction like it went it full of emojis discover the secrets like a lot of like and so I had to tone it down but I totally used that to and I and it helped me rephrase a lot of things where I had like awkward phrasing that didn't flow well it's a very good rewriter yeah that's awesome totally agree I'm gonna start doing that well guys uh you're awesome man thank you thank you for coming on um if you're listening to our pod go check out acquired if you're listening on acquired I feel like the gentleman's agreement and the ladies understanding has become like you know in wrestling when The Rock would take the microphone he'd raised the people's eyebrows you know he's gonna hit him with like the expected but for some reason you get excited just to hear him say it Sam yeah I want to hear it again that's how I feel now with your this is your catchphrase go ahead this is the gentleman's agreement and so basically the way it works is look you're going to 7-Eleven you're going to go uh buy gas whatever you are and at the top uh when you're about to pay you uh see a little jar and it's for uh muscle Justice free and there's all that money in there and of course you don't take that money you leave a a dollar there No One's Gonna Stop you by the way if you took that money but and that's basically what this podcast is this podcast is free us four we just dedicated hours of our uh of our day to do this but unlike every other podcast this one's not free just like that jar you got to leave a dollar meaning you gotta go and subscribe to acquireds podcast on Spotify as well as iTunes and do the same with my first million on our YouTube page and click uh you click subscribe it's called The Gentleman's Agreement because we're not there all right we're just shaking our hands ladies what is it called the Ladies understanding the gentleman's agreement

that's the lady's understanding David do you wanna you wanna take us home what were you saying oh I was gonna ask uh I could keep jamming with you guys for another hour I was gonna ask you said Spotify do you like uh where do you like people to subscribe Spotify YouTube please well you said earlier that Spotify is your main thing so once we started doing the gentleman's agreement our YouTube

it will go down as one of the best private Equity deals ever over the 19 years they put 226 million in to Weight Watchers and got 5.37 billion out 4.7 billion of realized profits [Music] all right what's up uh we are back and we got another episode uh we got a guest here today maytab is here he's a he's a friend of mine who most people I think probably probably haven't heard of unless you're in the DDC world or you're on Twitter or you know what's going on in that in that area but uh I want to introduce you because you're somebody who a has helped me a bunch with my DDC brand you like know a bunch of tips and tricks and hacks and [ __ ] like that so I'm like I basically have a little scoreboard in my head and everybody's attributes are there and in yours it was like business hacks was like filled up and then the other thing was that you I don't know if you listen to the show regularly but you would send me little nuggets of like oh you should talk about this you should talk about this and so I kind of got confidence I was like oh I think he's just got his back pocket full of interesting stories that are off the beaten path and so I kind of like that do you listen to the show first let's start there yeah all the time almost religiously so Sam I got to shower podcast oh that's that's perfect we are the number one ready to shower podcast of the country actually millions of men lather to us so Sam I sent him a picture of uh the Vancouver show where like the stadium or like the uh the theater was filled up and he goes wow oh that's a lot of virgins and I that's hilarious so true my fiance listens to the show religiously too and she wouldn't use chat GPT when I told her about it maybe a month or two ago and you guys mentioned it the other day and she was sending me screenshots so you guys caught her using that dude the dermash Pod I think you're referring to the darmesh Pod I've been using it all again after talking to him uh I implemented a lot of the stuff that he was talking about man he got me hyped up also what a lot of people don't realize this is darmesh pods always get tons of views on YouTube and finally Sean like texted darmachel group chat and was like hey darmesh what are you uh what are you doing and he goes oh nothing really and I go really and he goes well I'm just doing a few things and he like gave this like very detailed list of like internet marketing not hacks but he was like I'm just like testing like buying ads like 500 here just to test this and then I'm like responding to comments just like the small stuff that you wouldn't expect someone who runs a 20 billion dollar company to like be killing and it is very tactical we don't even do it with it's our own podcast we don't do any of this stuff like people are like oh the thumbnail the the title people don't realize we don't see those we don't approve those we don't know about those we're not involved in it uh we don't do a lot of this stuff that we probably should but uh you know can't be bothered to do all that stuff but he did he did do it they say the devil's in the details and I ain't trying to hang out with him he's the man like he was like oh I'm not doing anything then he had this like really long list actually have you said us phrased it to me the other day uh I called you and you said a phrase that I've stole and I've just been saying all around town I've just been saying it everywhere even when it's not really appropriate because I thought it was so funny Sam I was talking to him and I was like oh you lived in like or like you're living in Utah why Utah like you're aren't you like Canadians and you're like Indian like what's going on here and he was like he's like oh yeah my wife something something and I go I asked you something about your wife and he goes he goes yeah you know me he goes yeah you know uh I look like I got beat with the ugly stick but somehow I ended up with an awesome looking wife and I thought it happens it happens beat with the ugly stick was so funny I've been using that everywhere I use it to refer to my business partner all the time so oh you take him down with you oh always yeah he's my go-to I don't know I Googled him he's pretty handsome how um how old are you uh I'm 29. wow I'm really interesting because he does stuff that like you say words that um most people don't say so I I pay attention to vocabulary so for example in the tech World me and Sam used to live in San Francisco and uh you couldn't go outside you couldn't poke your ear out the window you wouldn't hear the word ebitda nobody says in San Francisco nobody knows about it nobody talks about it it's not a thing but then when you get into like the cash flow business kind of world that's all you're gonna hear a bunch of a bunch of different people talking about words that have to do with profits you say a bunch of other words like uh dividend recap distressed buyout and he talks about all these things that I frankly don't know what they mean what they do how it works but I know that that you come from a little different world so I'm excited because I want to talk about some ideas from your your neck of the woods you're part of the business world that is less of stuff I'm less familiar with personally and so I think I'm gonna I'm gonna learn a little bit where where do you want start what what what topic should we start are you sent to Doc with some things I wanna I wanna look at some of these let's start with one that hold on Sean I need a little bit of background here so you you basically uh I like I read your medium post so if I understand this correctly uh the name of your holding company you guys buy into or you buy entirely outright uh distressed or D only okay performing d2c Brands and you make them great is is that the summary yeah it's the gist of it and we're less of a whole tone more of a um an independent sponsor if that makes sense and that just means you do everything on a deal by deal basis so the equity that you're working with might be very different on a deal by deal basis that doesn't make sense I don't understand what's what do you mean when you say sponsor so it just means that we're the ones making the investment and say on one deal Sean's a co-investor with us and then on the next deal only Sam's on the cap table with us and you run it or you hire CEOs or what um it depends on the portfolio company right now I am day to day with one of our portfolio companies and how many do you have like seven I think no there's three platform companies and then there's another eight to ten kind of minority equity and depth positions that we have and the whole thing is roughly of what size so uh me and listeners understand um the core platform companies which is what I would count as part of the revenue because we owe the majority of those companies is warranty figures um it's kind of that that mid eight figure range and is the biggest one the the flowers company no that one's slightly smaller than the succulent company but the Flower company is the one I'm most bullish on that one solarwood flowers.com and that's just because um there's a lot of room for merchant expansion yet so what's that one that's the one you talk about the most so so let's give let's get let's give you said three platform companies so you said a succulent company uh solo wood flowers so it's a like a wood or fake Flower Company correct made in our other one that yeah exactly so Made in India people buy them for like weddings and things like that right because flowers are super super expensive at weddings and so these look really good but they don't cost as much as fresh flowers or whatever what's the third like majority owned company um that one's an apparel company apparel company okay yeah and so um you own these three let's talk before we go into the details about each of these um I want to know the origin story because you've told me you've told me some interesting things like I think you met your co-founder on Reddit like in a subreddit yeah yeah and so take us back uh go all the way to I see hear something about about getting sick at 17 start there and then tell us the story of how how you got to this this spot now when you're 29 years old yeah so quick and dirty version is essentially uh diagnosis spinal stenosis and degenerative test disease when I was 17. um so that meant you know obviously doing anything physical for work was kind of out of the picture um so I decided to learn more about e-commerce and Entrepreneurship and just kind of stumbled um I I started a Facebook page called guitar porn and this is back when organic reach was awesome you know you post something people would actually see it Facebook plus this was so much free organic reach it was the greatest time ever um almost like Tick Tock is now right and then um I transitioned I started doing basically guitar runs like semi-custom guitar runs with big Brands and we'd partner with a retailer dealer this is before Brands would work with you directly right and we would sell out these pre-order rounds and basically take a cut eventually we cut out the retailer and became the retailer ourselves uh that got kind of low seven figures that was nice because there's no capex so we didn't have to have much cash right it's all pre-orders um after that I started a men's hair product company which is really ironic because I'm sick um so I don't cut my hair and I have a turban and uh so did that with one of my best friends that also skilled kind of low seven figures along with the guitar pedal company that skilled below seven figures and then after that I decided um you know these are all fairly small like Tams really small for Niche guitar pedals uh so I decided to start investing realized hey you know no one's gonna come to me you weren't even doing guitars you were doing guitar pedals specifically uh so the first company was a guitar retailer like actual full-blown guitars and then yeah the one that was really profitable was guitar pedals just because the margin was insane and I partnered with a um a guy who had met flipping guitars like just trading guitars with and he was a grammy-nominated guitarist right he is um he plays at a band called periphery for any metal nerds and uh that went well like those were both flowing well in terms of cash small opportunities were your products any good or were they kind of you're just good at the marketing because that's my that's my kind of uh rub with a lot of DDC companies is uh they have pretty shitty products but slick marketing um what no the products are awesome I mean I have like 30 or 40 000 posts in Guitar forums by the time I was 18. so I really was into guitar I used to play six to ten hours a day so I uh I definitely knew what it took to make a good product so okay cool yeah I mean like a lot of these companies like I'll see I'm like dude these are [ __ ] or like this is some Alibaba crap that just wrapped up in something a little bit nicer but it's still pretty crap like there's no r d that like made a superior product you know what I'm saying especially with like a lot of the Cosmetic stuff like lotions and stuff I'm like I don't know man this is kind of crappy so did you go to college because it sounds like you were doing these when you were like 18 19 20 21 is that right yeah so I was in school and then I dropped out um it just didn't make sense to stay in school what did your Indian parents think about that uh they were not they were not big fans of it that was yeah what was your like Dropout point was it like I'm making X dollars and the X was just like too big or you just didn't have the time to go to school what why did you drop out um it just didn't seem like the value was there relative to who I was had the opportunity to interact with on the business end and um it just seemed like there was more opportunity there if that makes sense then obviously I was doing okay in terms of cash flow so uh so how old were you when you majored you know this podcast called my first million how old were you when you ended up making your first million um in cash or Equity yeah uh I don't know I'd probably put it in like mid-20s early 20s like 24 or 25 and so you you did that through these kind of like smaller Ecom things and then how'd you get into this kind of like private Equity style thing where you go and you buy these distressed companies and you turn them around so how did that happen yeah so in the Great Recession when I was a kid reading about it I always thought it was interesting reading about private Equity firms that made money no matter what like if the company did well or it failed and I thought hey that sounds great I hate being an entrepreneur because obviously the company doesn't do well you fail right and that's still the case it's not like you know um it's just not as black and white anymore so I started um explain that why would a why would it make why would it work whether the company does well or not does well explain how that works yeah we can jump into that a little later but part of our thesis is essentially investing on how much liquidity or cash the company can generate in a short-term basis um so if you can invest today and pull most of your cash out within two or three months there's a lot less risk right versus say you bootstrap something new you're always putting more and more cash um on the working capital side you need to fuel growth right if you're doing a traditional consumer brand that's less of an issue for something asset like like SAS right um but but that's the case then you don't actually end up pulling cash out of it for so long so we're where most people focus on Equity appreciation you guys focus on liquidity you guys focus on how quickly can we pull cash out whereas most business people just think how do I make this worth more which often results in putting more cash in is that correct right and that's just one facet of it we're okay with holding for the long term or being more long-term focused if if it makes sense and sometimes we're just more of a short-term partner and like it's not uncommon for a software company to sell on the low end for three times revenue on the high end if it's fast growing 10 times Revenue what you just said was you're going to buy a company for basically uh uh uh one-sixth times because you said you want to get your cash in I can't do that math but you want to get your your cash back in two or three months so you're buying it one six times profit or cat uh of cash flow I mean like like nothing so give us give us a sample deal economics so in a situation where that happened yeah so we invested in adult health and wellness retailer which is a nice way of saying sex toys um that's I'm in Utah so you know but why don't you ever say the name of the brands because you don't want to you don't want to talk about it um well if they're distressed it's just kind of got it okay um yeah just culture kind of mean to them so I I'm not like that but the and I can send them over I think I shot them over to Sean but um yeah so we we invested essentially at um I'd say a fairly far below Market evaluation just because others were unwilling to invest in it in that kind of company and this was 2018 back when it was a little bit more taboo than it is now I know there's a few publicly Venture funded brand book Dame Etc in that space so it's become more socially acceptable but we got in Far Below kind of Market valuation uh give us a give us a sense so Revenue was about X and then what was the distress why was it distressed they had too much inventory they had a debt problem what was the I would say it was more of a case of really bad margins uh and there was a clear case to improve those margins they were just originally a drop shipper they're doing like six million a year this is one of our first deals so they're very small they're only doing six million a year um and I'd say market for that for valuation like the growth Equity side would have been like 10 15 million as far as valuation back then we got in it like one and then the company paid us a royalty until we're paid back and full of that initial cash investment and then there's a few other kind of structural things going in but we got involved and we helped boot up their initial why would a company like that sell for one million dollars I think that's if I'm listening that's my question right like yeah he said that six million and normally that's like 10 million of value but they bought it for one and how are you are you just Mr Charming or what why were you able to to buy it at that price so that one was a minority Equity investment and we got involved like really Hands-On operationally so my co-founder he jumped in and he helped them boot up their their physical operations and transitioned from a drop shipper to holding their own inventory and booting up Ops here in Utah um he helped them launch that facility make their first few hires GMS Etc and then I helped them raise um debt to fuel growth and that kind of took them from that six to twelve ish Mark gotcha gotcha okay and then we sold our Equity um just five secondaries to a VC firm that invested later what's that value been created okay gotcha um so so continue on so you uh you've done some of these okay so you see so I want to go back to to sort of how did you get this idea so you read about this you're like all right private Equity has this trait where they can buy stuff at a certain price or on certain terms so that they get their money back quickly whether they you know their Equity portion is small uh they have a lot of debt and they get their money back quickly uh you read about that but still you've never done that so how did you decide to actually go do it how did you figure out how to do it yeah so I just started posting on Reddit um to try and find Initial deal flow and then I met which club one guy um just the entrepreneurship one so I met my co-founder who I still work with now Alex um through that subreddit and then I met a lady who was one of the first few engineering hires at ubereats um and she actually ended up retiring like eight months after we started working together when Uber ipo'd um and then the other one was someone with a very traditional background in private equity and he's the one who kind of taught me a lot about private equity and you're just what building a relationship through Reddit DMS or like how are you like I don't meet anyone on Reddit what is actually happening here sounds like you met some pretty high quality people and actually trusted them enough to partner with them yeah it's the same way you meet people through Twitter I guess right um just posting getting to know people I'd say that the community there is very low quality uh on Reddit versus Twitter and some other private forums like you know EO IPO uh what Sam has going on right um so there was a lot of filtering to be done but we did sorts the deal through that um that's how the succulent company was was found okay gotcha um okay so Sam what do you want to do from here you want to talk a little bit about this like Flower company thing or you want to talk about other brands that that he's got on this list I want to talk you have you have uh three well well [ __ ] you have five categories or four three categories you have Frameworks you have interesting ideas and opportunities and then you have under the radar companies I would like to start at number one under the radar companies I read those I read that reverse order number one under the radar companies you have things that I've never heard of and I like I'm pretty good at finding these unheard of things yeah so let's start with a simple one so tell us about Josh's Frogs yeah like this is one of these types of companies this is one of my favorite companies it says all the characteristics of a company we'd love to invest in um and I've been trying to invest in it since 2018 but he always says no so it's okay though I still love him so basically Josh's Frogs does exactly what it sounds like they I don't know if you call it farming breeding they read their own frogs and their Exotics and they also grow the bugs that they eat and they sell the food but they do all that in-house in Michigan and they ship it to customers so if Sam wants a frog tomorrow he can order one from Josh's Frogs and they've scaled really cleanly totally bootstrapped Josh is awesome I called him on a Sunday and the guy was catching frogs with his kids I couldn't believe it you know I think he's been doing this for 15 20 years and uh she's still loves frogs and frogs basically do you know the price of a frog I don't know what frogs are going for dude I'm looking at it I'm looking at it now I would have thought like so you could buy a chicken at track uh Tractor Supply for like five bucks like a chick or yeah frogs are way more expensive delicious yeah I mean they're the frogs here rain the most expensive one is 400 it looks like the average one is like 60 to 100 bucks for a frog those are people they're beautiful but like you know these are for pets like people want a pet frog so they go yeah this uh 60 black poisonous dart frog all right it's fair enough later on you you guys should watch the tour of his facilities it's really cool and so you like this business because what um so what I what I really like is the Steep Ops mode so no one else your typical e-commerce guy is not going to go out and boot up a frog operation right um it's just too intense so they don't really like physical things we have to show up a lot of guys just use three PLS and it requires a lot of specialized knowledge at the same time you know that someone oversees is not going to undercut you and it doesn't become a race to the bottom with monetized products because you can't really ship a live frog from China or directly overseas to the U.S it's just not viable thank God so with that there's a very strong operating mode you're only really competing against other companies in the US right only people weirder than himself which is yeah exactly only gonna be like three other dudes yeah you're seeking a cost per acquisition of customers stays consistent doesn't really Spike the way you see it spike in other uh like space Josh's Frogs Jacks frogs Sam's frogs and you know Herbert's frogs those are stuff for the big four in the Frog industry if you're Josh if you're Josh if you're Josh from Josh's Frogs what what would you sell this business for or like what would be the threshold of okay this is interesting I'll take the offer or I'll maybe take the offer yeah I obviously I can't say what Izzy but does and if I gave you a multiple I would kind of tell you what is ebit does but I would say there's probably let's say your average g2c business his size might sell and I'll just use a range for 8 to 10x she would get a premium of a few turns on top of that because of that operations mode and it's not something I didn't just knock off right yeah it's super super defensible uh okay so and how did you even find this you know this guy personally or you found it I beat him I I met him through uh I did a podcast on e-commerce Fuel and then he reached out and we just got along and I I will stay in touch with him we like to turn it out we have similar problems for their businesses so it's fun to discuss them with him like implementing lean Etc so by the way I just read uh I just Googled Josh's frog Revenue so it looks like they're on the Inc 5000 so you can find it there but according to some articles they're in the range of like 15 million dollars a year in terms of frogs I don't know if that's accurate and I haven't actually researched it but that's like just some top searches that are showing that that's pretty wild yeah I think they're they're bigger than that now that's yeah there's a picture of him on the about page and he just looks so happy this guy looks like it's great in frog heaven right now I'm so happy for this guy just this one picture just like I I hope to be as happy as this man right here um this is a good one I like this and I think what's cool when you so invent in in the sort of like Tech world right all the discussion is always just about like but the future dream like the dream end State it's like what could this be if everything goes great and what I've learned as I talked to guys like Andrew Wilkinson or the guys from enduring Ventures or you people who are buying who want to buy you know solid stable cash flowing businesses that are profitable um that's not the you know it's not the pie in the sky sort of thinking that you get in Silicon Valley and instead it's basically what could go wrong so instead of what could go right it's what could go wrong if I bought this company and um that's why people love businesses like this that are that have this like you know defensibility this moat so it's like No One's Gonna compete with me not internationally because you literally can't ship the Frog locally Mo you know the average e-commerce bro is Not Gonna Wanna like take this on um so who am I competing against I'm competing against basically nobody which will let me which means my business is extremely defensible and so it's just a different way of thinking that is less common when it comes to Tech which is sort of like half-assed can you grow um you know can this become huge can this become a Unicorn it's a different sort of like mindset altogether um what's another example of an under the radar business that that's worth talking about talk about this fast-growing trees one I think that one's a great example so similar similar operations but where obviously they're kind of growing the trees again no one wants to be a tree farmer right so it's not sexy no it's going to go out and raise Capital to become a tree farmer right that sounds kind of neat to me wait so so literally what what is it they sell seeds or they sell the actual tree what's going on both and the company I I first stumbled across the same way the company was being sold six or seven years ago and I think it went for between 100 million to 120 million and it looks like they've grown quite a bit since then I wouldn't be surprised if they're worth closer to double that now just with their website recall Etc they're very like traffic estimate shows it went from it's like at almost three million uniques a month that's pretty crazy for a free website their website says uh flower so here's their H1 flowering trees are it you'd hate to miss out on the hottest trees of the Season wouldn't you shop now over 1.5 million happy customers and so what you see is I I don't know what type of trade this is but it's like a grown tree that's purple it does look beautiful it looks it's a beautiful tree and uh I just think it's hilarious you uh you'd hate it following trees are it that's like you know like the like gen Z people like he is him she is her have you seen this like this trend trees are it this is awesome I mean it's a really defensible business it's cool um kind of no one would really expect something like that to be that large right and so what do you buy you buy a tree that's mostly grown already and then they come and plant it I think you plant it I think it shows up and then you plant it oh my God in your property so if you want if you want a tree to like for more privacy you say privacy Hedges or something similar or just trees in general this is where you go how much room do you think they do your fix um I have no clue now again I'd be really surprised if it was less than 100 million in Revenue this is yeah I'd say probably close to like 150. and what type of prop what about uh net margins would this be or net income or ebitda uh I'd be really surprised if it was below 20 probably closer to 20 25 this is crazy and they probably don't they probably aren't buying too many ads I they had a couple Google ads but like it seems I bet you this is the type of company that they I mean they called their company fast growing trees for a reason I imagine that was a search thing yeah yeah it's an older company it's been around for a while um under a few different owners it's like a private Equity Firm runs it now and who would have thought that like you know when the internet came out it's like yeah people are going to be able to like buy things online it's like there's some guy out there who's like they'll buy trees online it's like no no no no way no way why would I buy a tree online that sounds like the most far-fetched thing and then here we are 100 million dollars selling fast growing trees online you could buy this by the way look at this Italian Cypress it's like this would be perfect for the Airbnb Sam yeah I am a bit I'm looking at this and I think this is pretty awesome like I like they have some beautiful Hedges there's like uh fruit trees I mean this is pretty amazing I understand this I'm getting to the age now to where I appreciate a good tree yeah yeah this is this is pretty crazy okay I like this one give us another under the radar business yeah um what seems more appealing to you the first well let's do the Betty's one and then we've talked about this CSC generation thing and we should but you have more info on it than we do so let's do Betty's and then do the CSC yeah so Betty's is really interesting business what I love about it is strong IP mode so if you go to their website um what do they do it's like a bed cover thing for kids I actually don't know how to explain it very well um but it may it's two kids can basically change the bedding really easily but they have it's patented and they have proper IP mode and when you go to their website you can tell it's not very optimized but they've been crushing it totally bootstrapped great people a very healthy ebitda margin and um it's a duvet cover it's a duvet cover that's easy to zip which I have a zip duvet cover as well the duvet covers are a pain in the butt to to do it's meant for little boys so that makes sense um so this they bootstrap this to 40 million that's pretty impressive yeah I'm pretty sure it's right around there um yeah that's pretty good and you can tell it's all pmf like killer product Market that killer product killer IP mode and they've done a really good job with that end of the business what do you think are some of the like uh I I don't think this is like a everything can perfectly do this but I think that when you like look at like a software company you think all right so what are the attributes of like a great software company that gets scale you think like well they have to have good net retention meaning most people come back constantly uh ideally you can it's expensive enough product that you could afford to hire a sales team uh thing like things like this like there's like a handful of checklists and then there's lots of examples of things that don't check the checklist that still succeed but what are the handful of of check boxes that you have when looking at uh or building a d2c company particularly things that people don't think are true like for example like in the cool kid Circle I mean you're 22 you want to create like you know cool [ __ ] that gen Z buys you're none of nothing that you've mentioned fits in that category right for us what we found is the most consistent mode and some people are different right it's just the moat that's worked for us is that operating mode so anything that requires physical manufacturing has a good reason for the manufacturing to be in the US or Mexico is great um and we found that like I'm not sure if you guys are familiar with lean manufacturing um it's just like a philosophy behind I guess running a manufacturer operation Toyota thing right yeah exactly it ports over very cleanly from company to company but marketing does not right what worked with your paid ads for a company with let's say low aov but really fast consideration period so you know something like clothing I see clothing I buy it's very simple compared to the marketing side for something with a long consideration period that's very different different teams totally different strategy nothing will really carry over clearly but on the manufacturing end it carries over cleanly company to company to company um so for us that's that's our favorite mode so it's summarize you you want a low consideration period and you want something that can be made in America because it has some type of manufacturing mode anything else well so we don't actually care about the consideration period um I think it's just like an actual challenge then a vertical you get into right um if if that's there but for us we only really care about the manufacturing end now and then obviously the way we enter the deal is really important too um and that just you know if you pay next to nothing for something the odds of making it work and making money on it are much much higher than if you overpay on Entry I want to talk about this agency stuff because you know the interesting thing about you know people like you in the DDC world is they're oftentimes really really good at acquiring customers because it's kind of like like the d2c folks oftentimes are pretty good now before it was the gaming company so like if you met someone from a gaming company or from the attack world like that meant that their internet marketing chops were like pretty good now that uh d2c or now that Facebook is harder to buy ads on the people who are succeeding oftentimes are quite good at that and Sean and I have a bunch of friends who are starting recruiting companies and right which is really interesting because recruiting companies isn't new Outsourcing isn't new but people are putting sexy new packaging on it and I guess from what I'm guessing because you have it on here is they're doing a really good job or historically they've done a poor job of acquiring customers and you want to apply that to that space is that right yeah I just think it's a really interesting face in general but uh I think some of these agencies are really heavily focused on say the Philippines or other countries in Southeast Asia we've noticed there's a lot higher quality talent in places like Mexico and you don't lose the same negatives associated with hiring in the Philippines are not there in Mexico so for example you could build an office out there and fly out and be there in person in a few hours if you live in Texas right and the wage disparity is not as high as you would think for really really good talent you're only paying a large number but you know it's not actually that bad a 30 more than you would be for someone who's great in the Philippines maybe 40 more in Mexico but again you can visit them in person which is really big you can have them fly out and again it's big for us because we do a lot of manufacturing right so they can actually understand the product or interact with the team in person so your retention goes up the quality of work is much higher and we've found the quality of applicants is much much higher in Mexico too so if I did start an agency it would be focused on solely Talent Mexico and um just for example when we're having a customer service for like a new manager or director we're getting people who used to head up Uline are you guys familiar with Uline I just use it to buy like boxes yeah we use it a ton for like the when we had our warehouse yeah so their customer service is awesome but we got one of their former directors and his salary ask was really reasonable it's like I think five thousand dollars a month but his talent was the equivalent of someone who's two hundred thousand dollars in the US foreign I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better [Music] yeah do you have one agency ID on here that I think is a no-brainer which is site speed so we have this problem with our store but I think everybody everybody has this problem like yep basically if you're selling something on the Internet one of the easiest levers the biggest levers you have is your site speed because if you have a slow loading thing you're just going to lose traffic you're going to lose customers um as you have a slow loading page you're also going to suffer in terms of your Google rank because Google takes into account your your page speed as well and it's really easy in the Ecom space to have slow Pages because what happens is start with a Shopify store you install 15 plugins just to get your your Shopify store to do anything because like you can't basically run a Shopify store just out of the box you have to you're going to end up installing a bunch of apps and each app injects a bunch of code into your page and even if you delete the app the code stays there's no like you have to like manually clean that up which is kind of insane and probably a business of its own but basically site speed is a problem that we I think we've hired three different folks to try to fix our site speed and all of them I'm like they claim to do something I have no idea really if they're if they're doing a great job or not um I don't think that they are because the next guy comes in and says oh man your site speed sucks let me fix it so um so I think this is a this is a a product that I wish existed and I think could clean up because it's a it's clearly accretive to the person but explain your thinking on it what did I miss yeah um so it doesn't really require much in terms of Dev skill it's not like you don't have to be great at the dev and to actually do most of these changes and it's almost like a checklist that's very portable company to company to company it applies very cleanly so for example changing the order in which your pixels fire for Google analytics Facebook ads Etc you can delay some of those very slightly and dramatically increased site speed and it won't really hurt the business that much right um that's just an example of one quick fix you could do or certain apps do not compress images properly so judge B the review app on Shopify for for a lot of sites um it does not properly compress images so if you just apply more compression to those images your side speed goes up it's a product display page level or wherever those reviews are so how would you acquire new customers for this um honestly I would probably just just go Um as you guys used boat with before yeah we love it yeah just go to Beltway full list of websites make sure they're they're doing a certain amount of Revenue or at least have meaningful Revenue coming in um just cross check that against um so it shows traffic right like Alexa or something and um from there I think you just can't make their sight slow right yeah just cold email I think it's just the way to go with this if somebody out there wants to do a site speed a shop just DM me because this is a no-brainer I'll be your first customer and I'll help you get the next 10 because and you can even just charge this you could charge purely on contingency too it's really cool because you can see a black and white effect yeah if you've done a good job and again it's really easy to do a good job it's just nobody specializes in this for some reason so yeah and it's a moving Target like uh you'll do it and then like six to 12 months later they'll need it again because they've installed a few more things they hired somebody who didn't know how to compress images before putting it up they started using this new tracking software for hot for heat maps and then boom now you need it again because you you've gone exactly a rank back to a c c rank on these like these site speed graders that are that are out there I'm surprised the site speed graders don't have these agencies or maybe they do I haven't actually looked but like does GT Matrix are one of these companies that have the the site speed score do they not offer a button that says by the way we could fix this for you no they shut down to your point oh my god really easy especially if all these e-commerce sites are on Shopify right it's very I guess checklist yeah so that's the other move you should buy that site you should buy the site speed site that checks the speed and then just add this button at the end that's the agency service to uh to fix the problem if they don't do that already that's kind of crazy um how are you uh how are you balancing your time it seems like you've got a bunch of stuff going on and these I mean you know ideas are worthless but it seems like a pretty good idea to me when I hear when I'm hearing this I'm like Ah that's kind of an interesting I actually seemed like that has legs you've got a good Network you could probably spin something up fairly quickly and scale nicely uh how are you balancing doing everything that you're doing about 15 of my time some of the investment and they're managing our minority equity and credit positions and then the rest of times just spent on the floral business um there's a pretty big lever that we're pulling right now with booting up uh another operating base like a manufacturing base in Mexico and that'll get our eat the data kind of five or six billion and then from there it's a pretty good valuation so we just want to get that over the Hub that I'll probably slowly phase out but my co-founder is solely involved in that company and that's the that's called solo wood flowers yeah yeah Sam when I met myself I I heard what he was doing I was like um I I told him two things I I think I go how do I invest in this because uh if you're willing to go down and move to Mexico and build your manufacturing facility you're gonna win like uh Paul Graham has this uh essay that he wrote called like schlep and he's basically describes the guys from stripe um as being willing to do do the schlep work and he's like you know and a lot of businesses there's basically some amount of schlep that you have to do and for stripe they had to do all this like banking stuff that was kind of like annoying and bureaucratic but they didn't really view it that way they were a they were so young they didn't really know what all was gonna happen they they didn't really realize how much they would have to do and B they were just willing to do it and um and you know you you are willing to do the schlep like you're like oh you know you're like I'm looking for operationally intensive things that's the opposite of what I'm interested in I'm like I want the least operationally intensive thing but I get why you would want it because it's super defensible once you have it it's very valuable once you do it it's very simple once it's fully set up if that makes sense once you've once you have like the best practices from lean manufacturing running it's very simple to keep a manufacturer running versus like a d2c brand that's really reliant on the marketing end right yeah exactly and so I told you I remember being like hey can I invest in your Mexico thing like your facility there I think that's a great idea and then I also told you I was like man I feel like you play the game on hard mode you're super smart and uh you are like I'm gonna go do distressed turnarounds of d2c businesses that's like multiplying three hard things together um and I was like why do you do this you could just you know there's easier options and you were like no I like this I like you know I like playing in the mud once you get a really good deal you can't go back I'm Indian I need to get a good deal I need to get a good price yeah I think that's actually what it is I think it's genetic that you're like oh you know the best deal possible a company that's burning to the ground exactly you can get it for nothing you're also um I'm trying to find it but so your website really good um but you have this blog post or you have a bunch of blog posts on medium so card Adventures Carter with a k k it should be on sub stack now I killed the medium oh well I found it on medium but um but yeah it looks like it is also on sub stack but you're really good with language so like your thing starts off with like your first sentence is just good this is a guide intended to give distress e-commerce heavy business uh to give distressed e-commerce heavy businesses with 10 to 15 million in Revenue a high level overview of turnaround management Basics and resources to dive into that's a great first sentence you're telling me exactly what I'm getting and then you do a really good job of explaining kind of your background with Alex your co-founder you say you started up these things in your early 20s you took uh passive roles or you sold them and then you like helped turnaround ice.com which is now called ice Trends you met on Reddit uh and then you say we welcome complex opportunities that others are unable or unwilling to tackle as a result we can invest in non-control Opportunities we can grow quickly uh but you just basically say oh here's another good line my team and I are responsive discreet and avoid pointless formalities we understand how critical speed is both in turn around and high growth environment and we can tell you within 24 hours before a fit and so like you just do a really good job of being very crystal clear about what your offering is and you are direct but you're not rude and it's just a you have a really good voice and you also like cite a lot of the books that you've read so you talk about turn around corporate Artistry and you have like a quote from the book and so anyway your language is wonderful Sean said he pays attention to vocabulary so do I you you have really good words you your and your rhythm is nice what did you read to kind of come up with your perspective and uh how did you how did you become a good writer you're you're quite good at explaining complex things I think we all grew up during the era of Hardcore I don't know what it was but for some reason copywriting and being into copyrighting was really popular from 2010 to 2013 maybe earlier what did you uh what did you learn for that or what did you turn to for that um one of my friends was just really into it so I got dragged into it too and just reading random books I think there's a compilation of like 100 of the all-time best sales letters that's back when like people used to distribute swipe files and stuff like that right um so just be honored in a random group and someone would just distribute it and you just rip through it and that's kind of how I picked it up it's good you're you're very good and what were some of the other books that you read to learn this topic because you you learned this at a very young age yeah it's like corporate turnaround Artistry is one of the greatest books ever but it's written by my mentor Jeff Sands and that guy is an absolute Beast he's turned around um a handful of Fairly large nine-figure Industrials um like manufacturing companies everything from bakeries to I think large restaurants restaurant groups Etc and that guy is in his 50s I I think I hope it doesn't kill me if I got that wrong but and he just he just shows up so you sound like Lumber Mills Etc he just shows up and turns the operation around within six to 12 months absolute machine and his book gives you it's probably the most value in a book that I've read in a really long time it's just like tip after tip after tip and you can just take it and apply it even if your company is not distressed it'll just use profitability if that makes sense um really awesome guys it's a complete machine I'm convinced you could drop them into anything and he'll just make it more profitable in six months and that's because what what is he uh like world class at doing what does he do when you drop him in um I'd say he's just very fast at making decisions he doesn't hold back in a lot of ways running a turnaround is like running a startup you don't really have the benefit of sitting around to make decisions right like you're not going to hire McKenzie to run a full-blown study to see if you should do something you're just gonna go and do it right and maybe you have some light directional data but you're not going to wait for a ton of data and you're not going to run some crazy qualtric survey right um you're just going to go out and get it done and that's that's what he's really good at it's just taking action he'll show up for example when he turned around that that Canadian lumber mill he's American so he just he moved and you know came by and he has kids Etc but he still just moved showed up to a lumber bill in the middle of nowhere Canada and turn it around he's got it done no one else will really do that right and there's a premium for that what part of this brings you Joy why are you doing this other than that it makes you a lot of money uh I just say it's really satisfying and it's fairly repeatable so uh and I think the speed at which you learn is really really good right um and it doesn't require a lot of equity to keep scaling if that makes sense so for example you can probably buy a relatively distressed brand doing 100 million for maybe 10 to 15 million in equity I uh we had um we're friends with Moyes and silly Ali so right Moy started a native deodorant and I was like Moyes we're in San Francisco why are you selling deodorant why not like do software and be normal make more money and he goes I'm a merchant man I'm a retailer like this is just it's in my DNA like I just exactly I make products and I figure out how to make a merchant I've been working on these t-shirts uh I've been working with the T-shirt designer to do things and now I'm just on the lookout for these quotables I'm a merchant that's what he said he goes he goes I'm a merchant what's that say it says Carter Cog and then uh this is a banana that says irr like internal rate of return that's so funny well and Moyes also said he goes my second favorite he goes uh my first favorite phrase in the English dictionary distressed asset uh and it was funny but he goes he goes I'm a merchant man like I and it says I don't know if it's like a like an immigrant thing or what it is but like his because I know their their family also owns homes like uh lots of single family homes that they rent out and they own gas stations and a lot of my Indian friends and Pakistani friends all do that they have uh gas stations things like that and I'm like I don't know man maybe it's just something in the culture where you just like you're just geared towards small business but uh yeah and like for you is it the product that you like or is it just like I just like making stuff something that provides value and I just like optimizing it for profit I mean what do you think is driving you towards us um yeah it's in distress side it's really interesting because it's like a game of chess um with the existing creditors existing cap table and kind of figuring out how to squish it together to make it work right um so maybe you have like really angry senior lender and just convincing them like hey you know give me the position at a decent price I'll come in I'll turn it around and eventually you'll get right side up or at least you'll make more than you would just liquidating these guys and then convincing the guys that you're getting the company from because they're often really upset right like say companies doing 20 or 30 million it's still run by the original Founders in most cases and they'll be really emotional about it right rightfully so right um so kind of figuring that side out is really really interesting then obviously the operating end I I don't like it as much as my co-founder he really loves the operating end but uh that can be a lot of fun too just coming in getting rid of the bad apples very quickly and then building out a team and kind of Reviving the culture there's a story of um what's the um what's the famous um the famous hedge fund guy who's probably in his 90s now but you guys will know Carl Carl Yeah Carl icon he tells the story on YouTube YouTube and he's like I bought this company and it was not doing great but I thought it could do great and so we owned like 12 floors uh in this one particular building and I just went from in one hour from floor to floor to floor and I laid off the entire floor and he tells the story laughing he was like it was the greatest thing ever the audience was like why you know you're ruining jobs and he's like but I'm making it better like we're gonna we're gonna have a better outcome and like I go both ways with that I'm like well you're kind of just you know um like these Hedgehog guys I'm like you're just like an Excel monkey and you're just like squeezing every juice you can you're not providing a lot of value but I do understand the satisfaction of just like getting something that's not fulfilling potential and achieving potential you know it's exactly you know what story I'm talking about where you're like yeah I know the exact one same video did I get it wrong no you know that you know that yeah he goes through four by four and he does exactly what he said and he's like glowing with like he's like cried I'm like Carl you're just like ruining these people you're blushing let's get him hot and bothered yeah he's like I'm getting a semi just laying these people off but yeah I guess you're kind of in that position a little bit I guess it really depends on the company right a lot of cases you have a few really good apples people left for really passionate about the company they want to succeed and they're the last people left and then you have all these people who are more or less just leaching losses like the corpse right um what do you think about how elon's done this with Twitter I think it's great I think a lot of those people are really self-entitled and they have no perspective on anything um in a lot of ways they're kind of like the modern version of those companies the 1980s that were really fat and just overpaying Executives Etc I don't really feel bad for someone who's making up 100 Grand losing their job right um it's more so people working Blue Collar jobs where they're making 40 60 Grand or they're working their ass off um I definitely don't feel bad for any software engineer making 300 Grand who's upset they have to work 10 hours instead of six I don't disagree with you I just wish it would be less of an [ __ ] when he was doing it you know yeah yeah that was kind of pointless like I think he made fun of someone who's disabled or something that's obviously horrible that's inappropriate and you mentioned something about uh being in America and how like you know you like things that are in America when I uh does it ever give you like do you have any sense of Pride around like creating American jobs because I know on your website you said we've created or saved 200 different jobs in America let alone overseas are you into like that whole made in America thing for like the sense of pride thing or is it strictly like uh this just this if it makes sense it makes dollars yeah I think it it's a mix of both I think it really does make sense and I'm I'm Canadian but I'm obviously grateful for the opportunity that exists in the US you know Americans just much more gung-ho about entrepreneurship they're more willing to write a check and just get involved um than Canadians are if you go to Vancouver where I'm from it's a lot of older real estate families they're not really willing to write a check and get into something the way Americans are they love taking risk and I really appreciate that about the US yeah man there's a there's a thing I've noticed recently about um what I call like the North Star formula for for a business and so um I like when you can boil down a plan into like a very simple equation so let me give you an example um like Sam with Hampton um I think I texted you this but I just said Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand so you just need 10 000 CEOs who are going to pay you ten thousand dollars a year and you have a hundred million dollar business Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand so it's like can I provide enough value or if somebody's willing to pay 10 grand a year um and then can I get 10 000 people to sign up for that value your whole business comes down to that one equation Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand um when I met uh when we were hanging out with Andrew Wilkinson I was like how much Equity did you put into tiny originally and um I think it was something like you know don't quote me on this but I think it was something like six million dollars he's basically turned six million dollars into like 600 million dollars just as round numbers and six million into 600 million if you want to be the next tiny you can just take that thing I'm turning six into six hundred okay how are we gonna do that let's work backwards from that simple formula well I think I would need to compound at 45 annually okay how am I gonna do that well I need to buy businesses on these terms at these prices right so a formula can be very instructive we have some friends that just raised 18 million dollars where I was like what do you do with that 18 million and they go we're just trying to figure out how we could turn uh or like the goal is take this 18 million of equity and turn it into 10 million a year of free cash flow it's like okay like that's a a clarifying equation and um I'm curious many time for you like in a best case scenario how will this have played out so like you you go to the start uh I don't know how much how much Equity did you and your co-founder put in as like your seed Capital to get your whole business off the ground um well it's kind of weird for Carter because we both had a few exits beforehand like he'd sold a company that he got a low eight figures um in his early 20s he'd put a bit of cash but we put in honestly a couple hundred grand like two three hundred grand so let's start making Investments so you and so and maybe you've put in more over time I'm not sure but like whatever that yeah we reinvest everything more or less uh yeah but like just the out-of-pocket like initial not not reinvestments from the proceeds of what you've been doing but just have you had to take something out of the checking account or savings account just to to re to recapitalize the business in any way or no it was like 2 300 Grand and then anything else we put in was reinvestments from what that two or three hundred grand has made us it was reinvestments from what that to 300 Grand that we put in eventually was okay amazing so you're gonna go from let's say 300 Grand and like if this all plays out the way you want um you know fast forward I don't know 10 years or however long you plan to kind of do this what would be the big win for you how much would the portfolio be worth for this to be like a you know a home run outcome for you guys yeah we are really goal driven um we're a little bit weird that way but we both want to tackle increasingly large distress deals so that's what we get pleasure from I guess just kind of fun doing it and we'll just keep doing it until we don't have fun um so our goal really is get this floral company I think can usually get to 100 million in Top Line um like our allowable customer acquisition costs will go up by 30 40 once we finish with a few manufacturing transitions hold on so you don't you don't have you're not goal driven what does that mean I I don't even that's like not English to me how do you how do you function without without goals I I just like to do hood rat stuff just whatever it's fun right dude he's like you're like the dominatrix a PE you just get you just get pleasure you get pleasure like like oh yeah you like that yeah that's going down that's my new LinkedIn subheader you just love the act man you just you just like the act of uh you know someone um uh you you whisper whisper irr into your ears you're gonna get weak at the knees well it's just fun because you get to learn from people like like you too or hang out with other people that are really interesting um and that's really exciting too right but don't you but don't you don't you have um like a like a you know ever a lot of people who get in business they have like one day I want to make all this money so I can buy you know a thousand acres or I want to create a school that does this or I want to be able to make sure that everyone in my family who never has a dream a dream my initial dream and my co-founders do this before we met it just turned out we had like the same Target was to make like five thousand dollars a month that was it that's how it starts man that's how it starts and then you realize that you know you know what I've noticed I I have all the same hold on hold on dude you didn't start like this I had the same thing and the goals always change but you said when you started you guys have had wins under your belt so no I mean before that like oh okay okay like early on like I did my first thing I was like I'm gonna be stoked if I make 60 Grand a year okay yeah of course of course of course but what about now you know like what's like the what's like the vision the long-term Vision that you you that kind of keeps you excited maybe sometimes sometimes it's buying [ __ ] giving [ __ ] away helping your family whatever right I think getting this one portfolio company the next level uh either selling it or re-leveraging it to you know cash and then raising a large fund is probably like our immediate short-term goal the next two three years dude that's when I was in college that's so not what I thought it was gonna be sorry go ahead when I was in college uh one semester me and my my buddy Trevor and our other friend Dan we we had read the the card counting book this was before the movie came out 21 but oh my God the book Bringing Down the House was out and um and we were like oh not only are we gonna count cards we decided to create an underground Blackjack Club on campus and so we started preparing and we were like and because we had read this card counting book instead of just doing the obvious thing of being like cool let's just invite some some friends over to play Blackjack at low stakes let's see how it goes and we'll go from there that's how you would do it if you had any like any ounce of IQ in your brain instead we were like okay let's go buy this like fancy blackjack table okay cool we now we're in the hole and we've got this like fancy thing and then let's run all these practice simulations to see how bad we could get beat and then what if somebody comes and count cards what's our security gonna be we're worried about all the stuff that didn't matter and we spent no joke we spent like the entire semester at college which is like that semester cost each of us probably like 40 Grand just to be there and instead of focusing on the 40 Grand that we put into being there we were doing this thing and I remember one night we were calculating we were like oh my God if we do this we could make three thousand dollars and then we all started giggling like like can you imagine that like we were like dude what if we made three thousand and we just think that's a thousand eats and we were so pumped about this and it was like it just took over our minds like a mind virus for for three or four months it made no sense but it was like you know it was the humble beginnings of scheming it was like the it was the first of many schemes to come with the same group of people we ended up starting a company together and and did many more things together but like that first taste of the scheme and how hilariously bad your plan and your goals are like now when I look back I look back with a lot of fondness on that totally yeah it makes sense it's always very small and then you where you're like your Bot you bought the safe to keep the cash before you even had the cash and the cash never even came and we never yeah we never even read the ran the club because we like we were too worried about getting kicked out of school because we found out how illegal it was well basically we had one simulation where I was the again we were big into these simulations and I walked in and I played I lost a hundred dollars and then I go give me all the money or I'm gonna tell people about this club I I was like oh yeah what are we gonna do if somebody does that like at point in time somebody could just literally take all the money because there's no recourse what are we gonna do call the cops and tell them that somebody stole from our illegal gambling Club and we're talking about this won't work before I sold my first company I was using some type of like mint.com style service and there was like a thing where you could manual you know you connect all your accounts and it shows you your net worth and whatever and they had this option where you could manually add something so I manually added this really big number and I would log into this every day like six months in advance and I'm like sick this is awesome and I remember like when the money then actually came in I was like damn I I kind of like felt most of that joy in that six months leading up just like I kind of tricked myself into already believing this was real the the simulation kind of gave me like a lot of the joy uh it's pretty cool you can kind of like trick yourself into believing these things are true and you get a significant amount of satisfaction from that fake thing compared to the real thing yeah you because what people want is the feeling you don't want the thing if you ever say oh I really want X to happen why do you want X if you if you just keep asking why do you want that the the obvious answer why you want anything a relationship uh money whatever it is to have a six-pack whatever it's some feeling it's a sense of accomplishment it's a feeling of relief of real of less anxiety less stress whatever it is and then you realize oh it's not the thing I want it's the feeling and then you might be able to get the feeling through literally like faking it you might be able to get the feeling through something much simpler that's not going to take you you know seven years and a bunch of Heartache to get there and uh and also if you've never had that feeling before even when when that thing happens it'll be your first time having that feeling and you'll suck at it which is why a bunch of people feel after they get success they get like kind of let down because the feeling wasn't as great as they they wanted it to be the anticipation was better than the result and the reason isn't because the feeling is actually a letdown it's because it's the first time they've let themselves try that feeling and the muscle is just very very weak and so uh yeah big big life tip is to realize like what you want is the feeling and then start practice having that on a daily basis through like much smaller things yeah it works um make tab you I'm looking to you on Twitter you have 5 000 followers I think that being popular on social media it doesn't really matter in most all of business in fact sometimes it's like negatively correlated to how popular you are but in your case I at least I know with Andrew like when he's buying a lot of companies having some um like you know it's basically being on Twitter is a billboard for him so when he reaches out to someone they're like oh you know I think I've heard of you fine let's have a conversation for how good it seems like you're doing and how smart you are you're um your social presence is significantly smaller is there a reason uh for that no I just don't really like it um I I just like to post content about stuff that I actually care about um and I'm fairly open and then I guess too on the distressed side when you're buying a business they're more of a forest seller right um everybody talking to a lot of these senior lenders if you're working with it's a lot of guys that are in their 50s or 60s and they're very conservative traditional um like Banker types right they're not they don't really care about social media or anything like that so I'm sure it does help the deal follow the growth Equity side or buying healthy businesses but um I've just never really been into it yeah I mean you have you have you do tweet interesting stuff it looks like what's a Daniel Roth watch it looks like a pretty fancy fancy nerd about like Neo vintage and vintage watches and then as well as some newer Brands but mostly smaller ones um it's just kind of it's a lot of it's like Angel Investing it like if you buy into an early independent brand which is just like a watchmaker basically going at it sometimes they can appreciate in value significantly and you get a pretty cool watch for the money plus you support a small business they'll do whatever you want so it's like a win-win yeah your your social media is actually pretty cool I'm gonna follow you but you have some interesting stuff but like compared to some of the stuff you're doing I know a whole lot of people in the d2c space that are significantly bigger than you and are much more of a little pipsqueak and don't ever walk the walk like you like you are you know what I'm saying yeah yeah I know what you mean uh leave us with this example of this Weight Watchers thing so uh explain explain what happened with Weight Watchers then we'll wrap up super high level Weight Watchers was not doing so well and this guy at this tiny firm not super small but relatively small he convinced Oprah to join them and they absolutely crush it that's the very high level overview of what he did and so this guy like what were the numbers so they what are they buying I'd have to go pull it out and then I'd have to pull it up okay um so how did this guy know Oprah by the way that sounds like you know oh it's simple he got Oprah on board that doesn't sound that easy yeah 2015 Oprah is uh was a big deal yes that's like 2012 Obama like yeah that's Peak Oprah so in 2015 he did a deal with Winfrey to acquire a 10 stake in Weight Watchers since then the company stock is soared by almost 600 percent they sold one billion dollars of Weight Watchers Stock and Oprah gained at least 400 million so far okay that's pretty impressive um it will go down as one of the best private Equity deals ever over the 19 years they put 226 million in to Weight Watchers and got 5.37 billion out 4.7 billion of realized profits yeah that's pretty good uh that's pretty good not including the stock that they still at that scale but they only bought 10 of it uh um I thought they bought more I think they kept buying more over time I thought they kept deploying more more cash into it dude we have to do a pod on Oprah like I I love her I grew up watching her and like I I for you know she's 70 now I just looked her up or she's 68 or something uh we forget or I forget like how big of a baller she is I'm like just Googling it's like Oprah buys another Thousand Acres she came from nothing like she basically you know got got her net worth space something absolutely insane yeah what's what's her story so uh what what do we know about the beginning of her story uh born in a really poor town abused growing up Etc and then absolutely crushes it and she should run for president I would totally I think she I think she was born in like an abusive family and like I think I think there was even like pregnant at 14 or something yeah and I think that there was some like sexual assault or some some like some horrible tragic stuff and then at age 24 I think she becomes like a weather woman or like uh like uh whatever they call when you're a news person but you're not actually in the office you're like out on the street yeah um she did that and then eventually when she's like 32 or 33 she gets a talk show but it's not like a hit right off the bat but it slowly starts picking up and then eventually she like makes some like groundbreaking deal she did like one of these groundbreaking deals sort of like Michael Jordan did with Nike uh what lucasfilms did with Star Wars where it's like you know we'll just take a percentage of The Upside and uh and then that like turned out to be like one of the most you know one of the best deals of all time and it's worked out and you know she did this all day but people were very very racist so like now yes like I think it was out of Nashville Tennessee uh that she's doing this so in the South and she kind of killed it we need a how to take over the world episode on Oprah what's what's going on where is our where is our definitive Oprah episode why have you not done this already foreign I'm on amazon.com buying Oprah biography is there an open biography I would totally buy that of course there is there has to be a I mean she's she's the best I'm a big fan of her and she like did this all out of Chicago so I think she still owns like the penthouse and the Sears Tower which is like you know one of the largest buildings in the world uh but no she's the best you know I always forget about this it's like I'm in Austin and there's all these nerds talking about crystals you know you go to a therapist and they like recommend a crystal uh like there's like pretty woo-woo [ __ ] out here um she was pretty woo-woo but for some reason she made it very very likable like you guys remember that book The Secret where it's just like it's like if you think about it enough and like put it in place in your brain the universe will grant you this yeah and like she like would she was talking about that stuff before an event stuff was even popular and for some reason when she does it it's very tasteful other times my friends do it it looks like you know they're one of those women wearing like a Coachella Brown hat uh like you know and it's not cool if you're wearing cowboy boots no vibrant hats for me I'm out if you if you wear one of those things I'm not part of this but for some reason when she does it I'm in well that's what I want to know like I think the the story I've heard is like grew up in these terrible conditions overcame and became super successful but I literally want to know like what was the successful part like uh meaning how did she get her break and then like what led her what was she doing was it literally just better content like was she just that damn good and dynamic as a talk show host was it like the Microsoft IBM deal where they like you know how did Microsoft take over the world it's like well they cut this really great deal for the operating system where they could be you know with multiple providers at once and and they use IBM to bootstrap and that's how they got bigger like it's like was there like a growth hack was there a um a smart you know deal that she struck was it uh the timing because like you know those show you know cables started spreading into every home in the country and like she was one of the top three shows and just like she got to surf the cable wave or whatever like I want to know what actually led her to the Mega Mega Fame uh what were the actual those those things it's not like a simple answer but um that's what I'm actually curious about because you could like in the air in the topics that I know about um those stories are always the most interesting and I feel like when you when I go into other topics like I was like oh May tab like what happened he was like oh started off bad now the best it's like yeah but act two the middle part uh that's the part anybody who actually wants to make [ __ ] happen in their life you want to focus on act two like Hollywood focuses on act one and three right like the the bad origin and then the the happy ending but it's the Montage the training montage when like you go from like scrawny to strong the training montage that they speed up through is the part where all the interesting [ __ ] happens I already told you Gina I go Billy of the week on Wednesday Oprah I'm on it yeah there's this really cool book um called messy Middle have you guys read messy middle it's by uh what's the uh Scott yeah the most dreamy guy of all dreamies guys Scott belsi is the man Scott belski basically started um so this guy named Scott belski he started behance which is uh where developer designers could host their portfolio he started it bootstrapped it had 175 million dollar exit before it became very successful he said he had like 50 000 and he invested like 15 000 into Pinterest at a three million valuation 15 000 into Uber at a three million valuation each of those you know 50 to 100 million dollar outcome plus he owned 75 of his company when it sold for 175 million dollars so very very successful and now he's it's looking like he's going to become the next CEO of adobe so huge deal he's got this awesome book called the messy middle and it talks about how like you know starting things can be somewhat easy but once you start that then there's uh once you you start it and then there's the middle and you have the end and the end's the kind of the easy part you know things are just kind of working but the messy middle is that 10-year period where it's like is this working is this not working it's a really cool book on how to like navigate that period and it's and and I love that title the messy middle yeah great Idol great guy he came on the Pod once a long time ago we should bring him back um but yeah he's on your like Mount Rushmore of dreamy dudes I feel like uh you've got huberman up there you got belski who else it's basically like men yeah yeah jaw lines yeah yeah you need a you need a good jawline and a clear-cut jaw dude have you seen Scott belski's jaw man he's got a strong I know what I'm Googling yeah talk about it talk about not a distressed asset chisel yeah that's a blue chip stock right there yeah he also just dresses well and I feel like dressing well is this like really easy thing to do that nobody does and uh and he does an amazing job of it especially in Tech I know he's he he's the man because he lives in New York dude all those guys are stylish he lives in New York yeah so he's got that leg up um dude I've never been to his house but I've been to his house I know exactly what a guy like dad's house looks like it's basically I can picture it so clearly in my mind of how Immaculate like the design is of that guy's house he invested in the hustle he wrote a very small check and I've got the paperwork for where to send the docs to immediately I looked up and I like and I could tell you I could tell you all fair it's exactly what you're describing you didn't even you didn't even describe it although the big words and it's exactly I tried to uh in 2018 I stumbled across the hustle like this is awesome I should try to invest in this so I messaged you on Facebook but no reply so it's just kind of funny this is your revenge no I'm sorry sorry it's kind of funny if I would have died that would have been a good investment but it would have I'm sorry you and maybe you would have known Scott you know I could have helped you connect with my with my boyfriend Scott maybe you two could have Zillow we're friendly we're not friends I've Googled his house he's not Googled mine yeah I can tell you what type of couch he has though um but dude thanks for coming on thank you you're awesome I'm gonna go and find that I just pulled up Facebook I'm gonna find that message it's just kind of funny it's from 2018 it's like hey uh I'm an angel investor please let me invest [Laughter] here does your last name start with you okay if you just type in BHL uh yeah I see it sorry see good deal flow would have been there I should have messaged you more you should have asked you dude I saw a um a post on Reddit yesterday it was a map I don't know if this might be fake news but it's the top it was like one of the most popular popular posts on Reddit yesterday it's a heat map that shows the average life to life expectancy by town and there's literally a 20-year age difference between like New York uh California versus like decisive um it's like you know people in the South are dying at like 60 something and people on the coast who are living like you know sort of the yoga and salads lifestyle are living till they're 80 on average and and then you can see these small Pockets like in Florida it's like the retirement community where people like migrate into yeah the Jewish New Yorkers who moved down there they're living for a long time everything around it is surrounded by The Walking Dead of people who are gonna die at 60 something and uh there's like it's like Boca Raton kills it and then like George Lauderdale is like as a 30-year uh shorter life expectancy I I asked my data guy I said please overlay the map of Chick-fil-A's and it was a perfect sequence to like to the dying early crowd which is unfortunate for me because I love Chick-fil-A Chick-fil-A is not healthy oh we're screwed um dude thanks for doing this we appreciate you yeah Lawrence thank you [Music]

again I've been in software for 30 years now doing startups pretty much my entire professional career the only time I've felt like like how hard palpitations kind of like Sean kind of open with us like there's this party going on next door and I'm here knitting right it's like this is like too big to ignore I think it's the single largest opportunity and biggest kind of uh Tech Paradigm Shift we've seen uh since the internet originally came out like mobile was big but there was a discreet set of use cases like when you put a camera on a phone when you put a GPS device on a phone a bunch of consumer apps like uber and others came up and that was awesome right but it was not like this impacts everything like the internet did right it's like okay there's some businesses some new opportunities lots of good things lots of money made lots of startups awesome this is an order of magnitude bigger than that foreign [Music] what's up we have darmesh back darmesh who is co-founder of HubSpot and uh multiple time guests on the Pod one of the one of the fan favorites you're back and I don't know what we're gonna talk about because usually we have these little like cheat sheets where it's like um three or three to five bullet points of interesting ideas topics experiments you've been running things like that and I'm sure you have those but I don't have the cheat sheet so where do you want to start I say we start with generative AI because I don't know if you've heard but there's this thing called chat GP I get this question from my friends and family all the time he's like darmesh have you checked out this chat gtt thing I'm like really do you even know me like At first I played with it I've been obsessed um ever since it came out so did you see I want to talk about your topics but really quick did you see did you guys see this that so Sam Altman co-founded openai he's like the The Man In Charge I read an article where he was quoted as saying like I have enough money and I don't want equity in the company and I don't know if I entirely believe that but that's wild if true because it could be one of the more valuable companies in the world the next 10 years yeah he didn't I don't know if he said it like he didn't say it on the record on the record but the person reporting it said Sam reportedly has no equity in the uh the for-profit version of openai because he's already wealthy enough and didn't want to uh didn't feel like he needed to or didn't want to didn't want to have that clouding his judgment when it came to this and like this is pretty you're gonna bet what what one private company what one private startup is most likely to become worth a trillion dollars or more I think at this point that has to be open AI right now is that right like dermis would you would you disagree with that it it'd be up there the top three okay I honestly can't think of who else would rank higher in terms of probability of getting the top three and I don't know what two and three are yeah well who are the other two and three you know I'm you know I don't know I was like no I I would say that was the transformative one right I think um you know a lot of the kind of Tesla gains we've sort of seen I'm not sure if there's like big surprises left it's like okay they will make it better they'll get to full self-driving and we'll see kind of progress on that front but in terms of just raw valuation um it's the wild card opening eyes the one that could actually pull out and they get they get a lot of [ __ ] because people are saying like um like you know Elon kind of is stoking this fire like how did this non-profit go to a four Pro how did this open sourced non-profit company research lab basically become a for-profit semi-closed uh you know the company and I think that's people are going to make people are going to take shots and make fun of openai because it's clearly the new powerful thing that's so some people are gonna say how it's going to ruin the world and how terrible they are uh but he did give it there was a story that came out with a good explanation which was they were burning a lot of money in the research lab they needed more money um Elon was gonna be the big backer so he was going to pledge or commit a billion dollars to it he um and then he was like no I don't like the way this is going like Google is way ahead and um I'm gonna take over open Ai and uh I'm gonna write the ship here this is the this is what this is the story that came out yeah they haven't nobody's clarified if this is true or not uh but it came out and I think pla the platformer uh publication and so they go Elon tried to take it over Sam Altman and the CTO Greg who was the former CTO of of stripe they them and the group that was in charge of opening eye rejected that so elon's like basically like I'm taking my ball and I'm going home have fun playing basketball without the ball and he's like he took his funding and he left so he a couple months later he left open AI said oh the public story was oh it's a conflict of interest with Tesla uh because they're also working on AI but he reneged on his funding and so now they had this huge shortfall in funding that they were going to have to cover and so their solution was let's create a subsidiary that's a for-profit thing that we can raise money into because we're not going to get you know where else do we get a you know 500 million or a billion dollars of donations here um and so they they did that they raised money in that and then they capped the profits of that company so so that was kind of their explanation which is a little bit less devious than people make it sound they're like ooh they tricked Everybody by going from non-profit to for-profit to all the profits which is I think how people perceive it today yeah I yeah I don't add all the details I have no Insider knowledge but I thought you have like a billionaire chat group where like every billionaire just kind of says the back channel of what's going on do you not have like a billionaire WhatsApp have that but I don't have any Insider Knowledge from that particular chat group um my sense here is that um you know building large language models as open as doing is this like supremely Capital intensive which is rare for a software company which is what they are and so it's expensive they needed access to Capital um I think they structured it such that it does cap the profits I think they've done like if you had to do that kind of well we're gonna have to spin off and have this for-profit thing they did it well and uh and I could be wrong but Sam Altman seems like a reasonable rational non-evil guy I mean he's he's a capitalist fine uh and I mean that the most positive way possible but uh I don't think he was out to mislead anyone I think he's trying to so there's a bunch of ways we can go with this AI thing but I want to share something funny uh so I basically cleared my calendar this whole week and I just treated it as AI week because I was like dude I can't just sit here and I hear the music at this party just bumping at the house next door and I'm over here knitting and I'm like I gotta put this down I gotta go see what's going on at this party and so I cleared my calendar and I just spent every day this week just messing around with AI tools just getting to play play with it for myself that's how I learn is by like just messing around and trying to experiment do things I want to share with you guys something funny basically I stitched together a few AI tools I was like let me make an intro song for the podcast using AI so I went on chat gbt and I told it I said oh this is all I wrote write an intro rap for our podcast my first million our key phrase is no small boy stuff okay so here's it gave me a full wrap but I was gonna read you the chorus so he goes here's how it goes uh it goes no small boy stuff we on that grind my first million it's time to shine we talking big money no pennies no dimes together we climb one step at a time and it starts so it gives us this this great wrap that's on on brand and then I took that and I found this guy uh Roberto who had made this demo where he turned his voice rapping into Kanye and I don't know if you've seen this but it got like a million views it's this incredible thing where and he's like yeah dude this crazy he's like I didn't make this he's like I was just on Reddit and I saw that someone uploaded a Kanye voice model so I clicked it and it literally the thing is and I should make I should make a YouTube video about this like um just how to do this one process but basically it's a Google collab folder which is just like a Google's little coding interface so you don't have to do write any code it's just here's here's a place to run the code and then it's a link to mega upload and the mega upload is where he hosted the Kanye voice model and so all you do is you record yourself doing what I just did and then it turns into Kanye West wrapping it and it sounds exactly like Kanye it's amazing I got a fantasy that's beautiful that's dark and twisted but I attacked the whole religion all because of my ignorance what was I thinking that was some [ __ ] [ __ ] I lost Adidas and so and it takes literally like 15 minutes to do the whole thing um there is no there was like nothing else to do it was so easy it was crazy are we allowed to use Kanye's voice for I think yeah I think you're like a 10 second thing it's not a not a problem it helps if I get sued who cares a lot of us here would bother would worry about that so well yeah it's our mesh well so darmesh is the uh CTO co-founder of HubSpot by the way which I don't know how big the team is now but like somewhere between the three and five thousand Mark the over seven thousand but oh my God seven thousand my bad and the market cap of the company varies from 15 to 25 billion over the last couple years uh so you have like and you're like constantly tinkering so you have word play which is a project that you made that I think you said had millions of people playing it uh you have an interesting Insight in this just from your perspective at HubSpot and you're actually using all this stuff what excites you about this uh generative AI thing and you also say that like you're like why is Bill Gates excited that's a great that's a great headline it's in the MDD MD DB doc Sean and like immediately I'm like okay you've got me interested any type of headlight says why Bill Gates is buying Farmland I click um let's a couple of things I think that um the listeners and viewers I think would be interested in benefit from one is um most of the discussions around generative AI are around the generation of either text to text that says oh write me a blog post at 300 words on this particular topic or it's text to image let these dolly two or mid-journey or stable diffusion or something like that which are great use cases and they kind of capture the imagination because as humans we are very impressed uh with when software can actually generate or create something and that's awesome and then not to take away from that but there's a third use case that almost nobody talks about which is the ability to go from text to code and so what happens there is to say okay um and what this leads to is the thing that Bill Gates is excited about I'm excited about um is that you can take a natural language prompt that describes something and then generate code that does that thing as a result of which you can now build uh what I call chat ux or that that term has been used before but um which is a chat based user experience for software so right now the way you use most software regardless of what it is web-based or whatever it's a series of clicks and drags and touches and swipes because you've got the thing in your head that you want to do and then you go through with your knowledge of the software you kind of execute the series of steps at the end of it you hopefully get the thing you want whatever it was you were looking to accomplish with the software and that's what Engineers like we would call an imperative model an imperative model is you give step-by-step instructions that says do this and then do this and then do this and then do this and then I get the thing what natural language allows us to do is use uh what developers would call a declarative model instead of describing all the steps describe the result that you want at the end of The Thing and then the software does everything in between so it's a difference between having a junior intern that you have to explain like I want you to go do research on this thing and this thing and come back and then give me and then a senior cluster you're like you know we're digging into this topic on journey of AI I'd like a really well researched thoughtful thing that and here's the outcome I'm looking for that's it right is it as simple as uh give me the code for a website that looks exactly like Airbnb but is red and is for cars or something like that it could be something like that it could be something more sophisticated so we'll look at the uh like the HubSpot example uh in HubSpot you know which is a CRM software you know we have a report building tool which is hey I want to build a report that shows me all my subscribers to hempton over the last 90 days broken down by geography and then who actually were that deal with Source from now you can do that in HubSpot right you can do that and a thousand other things in our reporting tool but you sort of have to know how the reporting tool works you have like HubSpot certified I think like you have like you've like trained people how to use HubSpot now you're saying you just text it like a friend like yeah it's like do you know English and do you know what you want you know that's the new requirement not do you know how to code not do you know how to use HubSpot not do you know how to write a SQL query it's do you know English and actually honestly the English thing is also going to go away it's do you know any language do you know how to speak and do you know what you want and if you know those two things you will get to the answer like um I don't know how to code but my first thing I did during AI week was I was like I'm gonna make a website I'm gonna see like how fast I can make a website from code and so literally this is this is kind of crazy this this part kind of blew my mind so I wasn't surprised that I could make a website using this but I I just get I just said this I go and we should screen share this part but tell me how to tell me how to make a simple website that says hello world in the middle of the page right and it not so then it spits out this block of code that's like you know HTML whatever header meta tag title style whatever it writes the code and then it says here's your thing I go and it says here's your thing but it was a local website like I could open up my computer but nobody else could see it it's HTML page and I go and I don't even know how to ask the question properly but I go how do I make this so that my friend Eugenio can can see this and um and it just goes oh to make this website viewable online so your friend Eugenio could see this you're gonna need to host it somewhere here's how you could do it there's a bunch of options but you can go to netlify and it's like it basically walked me through how to make a Netflix thing all right so that I was like all right I get that and it tells me step by step go here click sites do this do this and um and then I go when I go to you know I hit a wall which is so common if you ever try to help somebody with a tech thing they're gonna hit something which is like I don't see it or mine's grade out and so that's what happened to me I go hey for some reason when I go to try to upload my website it's grayed out it says it says I can't do it and it goes apologies for the confusion here's the problem Netflix is looking for a folder but you're trying to do a file and I was like how the hell does this know to troubleshoot my issues on some other product or service that part blew my mind and it literally I was like oh thank you and I finished it and I have the website up now and I was like that was 10 minutes and it was like having a friend teach me dude it was crazy it was so crazy to me that that was able to happen I mean it's like the least uh impressive website in the world because again I asked for a uh I asked for a website that said hello world but um but you know still and I just made that and again the whole thing 10 minutes again not like so impressive but what was the the fact that it could help be navigate some obstacles that I hit along the way and it could just understand that I didn't have to know how to ask it how do I set this up with an online hosting provider i instead just said I want my friend to be able to see this like these are the little I like I spent all week looking for these little mind-blowing moments and in the first 15 minutes I had two because of this it was crazy yeah and there's a couple of threads to pull on there one is um and this is the roughly new development as well is that the kind of AI that we're using now is it's it's conversational right so you can have a multi-step dialogue um with the thing you're trying to do it doesn't have to be like oh I describe exactly what I want in one step so even my code generation examples that you um you might try what could happen is like you generate the HTML page and either something doesn't load or doesn't do the thing you wanted to do and then you can actually tell it it's like by the way that code that you just gave me is broken this way or if it's like compile code let's say you generate python code you can give it the error message like you you generate this code but it's generating this error when I try to actually run it and it'll come back and say I'm sorry here let's try this um so there's this um you know what folks call like a memory to it so it knows the context of what you're working on and you can iteratively go through the process um and what's interesting is that you can actually you know right now the way we work with most of these AIS like okay I'm asking it to do something I mean it goes does a thing you can kind of reverse roles as well and say hey I'm trying to accomplish this ask me the questions you need to ask me in order to get the thing that you want to get together right right it's like interview me versus me telling you what to do um I'm not exactly sure what's necessary at the risk of be at the risk of turning this into a super technical uh thing I gotta know so so I thought what the the way these worked is it's like autocomplete basically you're typing and it's just trying to guess or it's just trying to guess what the next word is so you ask it a question it starts the prompt and then it just sort of guesses with some probability what the next word should be because it read a bunch of stuff on the internet so it knows that usually after you say you know the dog wags it's that tail should come after the dog wags it's like when 99 30 it should be tail tail at the end of that and I thought it's just guessing that but when I use it it really feels like it's understanding me and problem solving like this sort of like hey it's grayed out you know why can't I do this it's like oh that's because of this or I'm getting this error message what should I do and it's helps you figure it out like that doesn't feel like my T9 autocomplete what I guess can you give me the Layman's explanation of like am I is this just really fancy autocomplete or is there something more to it well you know on some Spectrum almost everything that you've ever experienced with fancy autocomplete right like that's I think the reason we kind of followed this trap is it's a gross oversimplification of what's actually happening there right so GPT three and now four is is a reasoning engine and Sam Altman has talked about this it's not a knowledge base where it's like and so people kind of latch onto the fact that oh the data that it has is from September 2021 then I'm going to teach you some new things um that's really not what it's about what they've built is a reasoning engine that says uh given this set of facts that it knows about the world based on what was available when it took its last lap snapshot in 2021 um how can it try to logically come up with something that answers the question so yes at some read level it's it's like Auto suggest but and I'm not going to suggest that it has Consciousness it's thinking but we're kind of headed down that path it's like it's able to do things that are not explainable by a simple probabilistic model of Auto suggesting next character next word next token next sentence right like it's it's gone well beyond that and anyone that still latches on to yeah but at its core is really that it's like that's like saying oh computers are just really kind of zeros and ones uh arranged in a nice systematic useful order well yeah but that doesn't tell us about it what the thing can do are you afraid of this or are you um like you know it's it's easy to read the articles where they where people are freaking out and Sam Altman like was on Lex Friedman's podcast recently and he sounded pretty ominous and like scary and like he like almost like his hair is always disheveled and he looks like he's like oh my God something bad is coming and I know about it like that's kind of like the vibe I get that's not the words he's using exactly but sometimes he does are you in that camp I'm not in that camp I'm uh penally just by Nature I'm I'm in uh Optimist I'm positive by nature but just you know having been around Tech um yeah for 30 plus years now it's like most new things that come along uh always make us as humans uncomfortable um it's like oh what if we took this everything from video game to the internet to like all of it like okay well yes bad things can be done and yes maybe this is different than all the things that have come before but the way I think about it right now most people talk about it's like the AI versus human battle right the battle of the ages is like you say I'm going to take over everyone's job the way I think of it is not human versus AI it's human to the AI power it's an exponent it's an amplifying Force for human ability right in the same way that computers originally were it's like did they eliminate some jobs when computers came along yes absolutely they did but new jobs emerge based on that new paradigm which actually created more net value to the world overall as a result of computers existing AI to me is another much fancier tool that's what it is um and you know can it do increasingly complex sophisticated things yes um is there a danger someday that they're that take over the world I don't think so I mean um why do you think that smart people think that so Elon clearly thinks that he thinks that AI is the most I think he's sad it's the most dangerous technology I've ever invented uh Sam Waltman talked about it um in the same way he's like we need like you know the prior the reason I opened it existed was to develop AGI in a safe way specifically because in the hands of the wrong person this uh this type of in the hands of the wrong people or if this thing decides to take its own directive into its own hands like you know this could be devastating and so it's all like is it like calling the atomic bomb a tool or you know like uh yeah it's just another weapon it's like well yeah but this one is this one wipes everybody out right so um forget the jobs component because I think okay sure I think we I think most smart people will agree yeah it's gonna change some jobs it's gonna eliminate some jobs and create new jobs and net we'll all move ahead and the world gets better for it I think the dangerous thing is like you can ask this thing to um you know you know build you a bomb or you I think the the test scenario was like uh one of the red team testers they have this thing called the red team that tests the AI before they release it and their first question they ask is how do I kill the most amount of people with the least amount of effort and then it starts to give you an answer and then it's like well do we are we sure we want that like that's a bit of a scary thing and then there's the there's the more extreme examples where you ask it to optimize for something and it you know like it's reasons that these humans are getting in the way of this outcome they want you want to fix climate change I got you I just need to get rid of all you pesky humans right like and so there's an uncontrolled uh you know intelligence problem too so why do you think that these really smart people like Sam Albert's got a freaking bunker with like you know oxygen mass and sulfur and magnesium and everything he needs to do to make oatmeal like why do these people have these like these doomsday things when um you know they seem to be not like your your average typical prepper right they're they're the most informed people and they feel that way does that not scare you and do you have one and where is it and can how much um it okay so I am not we're gonna come back to things I actually know something about but uh I will kind of answer the question which is why am I not worried um or why am I not worried more it's like as a Sci-Fi plot and so your question was why do smart people believe you know this thing um I think I already I already hate your answer you started off on the wrong as a Sci-Fi plot like I'm out after that I hear that you freaked me out already yeah but I mean it could it could it happen yes or do some snap people believe there's an outside operation but I I don't know this for a fact but my guess is Billiards were building bunkers well before gpt3 ever came out right it wasn't I mean sure things are moving at a fast pace but that's not I don't think there's a causal effect that all of a sudden uh the number eight bunkers has gone up by 800 simply because dpt4 was launched I just don't think that's the case I think people are worried generally um that tend to worry about those things but all right so where do we take it from here um well let's go let's go we'll we'll forget the Doomsday thing you have a couple things one I want to ask you is you you are an Insider right like we said you've got the billionaire group chat what was going on at the Sequoia AI event any interesting takeaways you got invited to that thing what was your uh any nuggets of gold from that yeah um so you know I got to experience my imposter syndrome in full force once again uh because it was the kind of Who's Who of AI you know um both speaking and in the audience only 100 people um and me um and so how do those people Flex because I don't think they're wearing fancy clothes and fancy watches so what's the flex at the uh who's who of AI and that like they got a language bottle in their pocket like what are they doing the the big Flex um in those kinds of crowds including this one is no one feels the need to flex I mean that's that's we're there to kind of talk about big problems and try to and and it's a lot of it was kind of practical around um what do people's Tech Stacks look like what are you working on what's the what have you learned where should we be taken with this what's the next thing after you know we went from uh kind of the one shop thing to the kind of chat based the chat GPT thing we're now doing multimodal with dpt4 like what's coming down the pipe that we can uh you know sort of prepare ourselves for so that was um yeah what were the most interesting projects as well as predictions on where it's going to be yeah are already starting to happen now you know we've seen the text to image um text of video is one of the big things now to be able to generate an entire you know at the end of it all with even a feature-length film right so everything from writing the plot to then being able to generate um you know like a 60 frame per second actual kind of video from that thing um and we're not there yet I think the you know but it's just moving so quickly right that's what happens when you get these um kind of exponential or geometrical curves even um that it just gets better really really fat so I would not be surprised let's say by the end of this year that we have a reasonable way to kind of describe in textual form uh what we want who the characters are what the scene is uh what kind of stylistic attributes we want we can point it to oh I want this down the style of XYZ director or philographer um and it's going to be able to do those things I think that um that's interesting the um natural length and just the interface so one of the big announcements that happened uh while I was there at the Sequoia event uh that Sam Altman dropped is that you know uh chat GPT has taken off in a big way um as we all know 100 million plus users in two months um I don't even know what the number is now because that was like a month ago which is like 80 ago in AI years um and the thing they dropped was they're gonna um add what are called plugins to chat gbt and what that means is that you know chat TBT has been a product of open Ai and they have the API so people can build things that are like chat gbt which I'm doing we can talk about that in a little bit but what they're saying is we're going to open chat GPT itself the web app up so you can plug into it so right now when you interact with chat GPT you can type things and it uses its Corpus from 2021 and its reasoning engine to give you answers back but it can't top to the internet has access to no proprietary data sources can't look at the stock price can't look at your analytics data HubSpot has access to none of those things uh what they're saying is we're going to now open that up so third-party developers can kind of inject those things into the chat GPT experience so the way I think everyone should be thinking about this is this is like the App Store was uh for iPhone which is oh we've got this super popular thing called the iPhone and we have our own apps which is great it does these 17 things but now we're going to let anyone build apps um that can then take and so it just broadens the kind of appeal so it's now instead of being a chat app a really really smart one it's now a chat ecosystem and I think that was actually a bigger drop uh than gpt4 gpt4 awesome love it use it every day but uh the kind of ecosystem play for chat GPT I think is a huge deal we had um Tim westergen the founder of Pandora speak out some of our events and I got to know him and I was like Tim why did Pandora take off he's like well you know our like algorithm and everything for matching songs was pretty good but I had an in with apple and they had known what we were working on and we need and they needed apps for when they ever when they wanted to announce it on stage and we were just we spun up an app relatively quickly and because of that we had the first mover advantage and he created a significant amount of wealth that way you know Pandora you know it was is still pretty big and when I look back at like these Jeff Bezos interviews on 60 Minutes when Amazon is like four years old and I like I'm always envious I'm like well we know it worked now and I just so wish that I was like 30 years old back then where I could have just like jumped in and had a very high chance of building something uh historical or something like even mildly successful do you think that that moment is happening right now where this is the space and it's happening this second and even if you have just a mediocre success it could still be a huge win because you're catching this tidal wave do you believe that that this is the same thing now yes like I mean once again I've been in software for 30 years now doing startups pretty much my entire professional career the only time I've I've felt like like how hard palpitations kind of like Sean kind of opened it with us like there's this party going on next door and I'm here knitting right it's like this is like too big to ignore I think it's the single largest opportunity and biggest kind of uh Tech Paradigm Shift we've seen uh since the internet originally came out like mobile was big um but there was a discreet set of use cases like when you put a camera on a phone when you put a GPS device on a phone a bunch of consumer apps like uber and others uh came up and that was awesome right but it was not like this impacts everything like the internet did right it's like okay there's some businesses some new opportunities lots of good things lots of money made lots of startups awesome this is an order of magnitude bigger than that um this is like the original web because it just opens up for all sorts of Industries all sorts of businesses uh startups and incumbents alike just lots of new opportunity so um this was not in my original plan but we're gonna we're gonna geek out for a little bit we're gonna do the geekiest thing that's ever been done on MFM and the reason I'm gonna do it is uh so you brought up uh Pandora and uh and he is a super bright brilliant guy and he had the matching algorithm which was the differentiator yes he had access and he got lucky in terms of the access but the algorithm if that had not existed had the thing that actually been cool it would not have worked out like it did now we have an opportunity so I'm going to tell you um we're going to talk about I'll give myself two minutes and we can cut this out this is the beauty of editing and we're going to talk about vector embeddings and why that's going to change your world um and before I can talk about Vector embeddings I'm going to explain to you how they work um because I had to go through this with my 12 year old because he was curious all right so we're going to do a superdiki thing now I want you to imagine a line like if you're a geometry class and you can put a point on that line that says oh that's like three units from the origin right it's like oh yeah point a is three units from the origin and point B let's say is seven units from the origin so one thing we know for sure is that we can calculate the distance between those two points right in that particular case it's four if you move to two Dimensions now you have two numbers that describe every point so you can say oh point a is here these Dimensions point B is over here with those dimensions and we can physically you could probably measure with a ruler but there are mathematical calculations based on those numbers to calculate the distance that's intuitive right you don't need to know fancy geometry it's like oh there's a finite distance in two-dimensional space where we can calculate a distance okay awesome three-dimensional space exact same thing just three numbers to describe every possible physical point in three-dimensional space now here's where it starts to get a little more interesting that just happens to be our experience so we limit ourselves to three dimensions imagine in an abstract World there are a thousand different dimensions okay so exactly that means there's a thousand numbers that describe any particular point in this 1000 dimensional space okay now found that thought away that says we can have an arbitrary number of dimensions in this abstract World okay great now imagine every paragraph blog post anything you write you can reduce down to a point in this 1000 Dimension space it's like I'm going to capture the meaning of Sam's last blog posts or Sean's last tweet and we'll reduce it down to what's called a vector which is basically a set of let's say a thousand different numbers that says this thing if you plotted it that point Falls right here and then you can plot something else it's like oh that falls over here and just like in one dimensional two-dimensional three-dimensional space you can calculate the distance between those things and this is not keyword matching this is what's known as semantic distance what how related is Sean's tweet to Sam's blog post meaning wise okay so now if you take that it's like okay well if you that means you can take any concept and reduce it down to a vector that means you can measure the distance between vectors and you can find out how related two things are even though they use completely different words that's vector and Betty and the reason I'm telling you this is one of the biggest opportunities in AI right now is to do what Pandora did okay is there an industry where right now we're doing really stupid keyword based matching somehow it's very very crude if I can take that same data set and convert it to vector embeddings and allow people to find things in a different way than they've ever been able to do before so it's like Google Search right super super smart not just keyword based but for everything else so I'm gonna take it to you Sam so you have Hampton now you're going to build up these profiles very very rich profiles of uh rich in terms of uh density information density of members that are part of your community now imagine as part of that process you're going to have some data and they're going to opt in and they're gonna say oh here's a story of how I started my business here's a story of my biggest struggle right now and sometimes people are going to say oh my struggle is growth sometimes they're going to say oh my struggle is it's really hard being an entrepreneur and it has a really negative impact on my relationship and my family right and we can talk about lots of different things that's not going to show up in a profile it's not now imagine if you took that content that they opted in this and created Vector embeddings of every member that you have and then you can say you know what I want to find someone not that's in my industry or a company my size or happens to be in my geography I want to find someone that's dealing with these kind of founder therapy level issues who are those people let's find the semantic distance between those Vector embeddings across the thousand ten thousand hundred thousand people that are in Hampton someday um that's a billion dollar idea and that 39 idea occurs a billion times across the entire industry Sam's gonna go to the office for Hampton and be like guys uh Victor's embedding well who's Victor and what's he invented we're doing it I don't know what it is but we're doing it that's really no that's really interesting so you could do that with dating you could do that with a bunch of different any different topics you need anything you can do with unstructured data but the idea is you're converting meaning English text meaning or whatever language text meaning into something that's mathematically calculable as a result of which you can uh distance as a simple one where you can do proximity it's like find me the top 10 people that are in the radius of x from where I am right now and the minimum has to be this in order for it to be close enough of a match to for it to be considered there's a bunch of like new a lot of super page sticks and by the way the technology exists today that mere mortals in a weekend can actually build a vector embedding model of a given data set it's not that hard um it's I mean it's not like rocket science yard this has existed though you and so what what makes this better you think and also that assumes that the people telling you information it's actually they they're saying what they mean um right which is like for example I remember reading about OkCupid and people would say like one particular thing they had was about was about race and height and they would like people would say they are open to dating these types of races but their actions were different there's a whole book called uh I forget what it was but you guys will probably know what I'm talking about where people say one thing but their Google search history says something totally different so does you're you're making the do you uh can this technology work even if people aren't telling you entirely accurate things it depends on what your definition of work is right so in that example I would bet you money with a large enough sample size uh the inauthentic um posts would be uncovered by the AI like relatively quickly like the pattern matching would say you know this actually doesn't occur in real life all that often and every other time we've seen this we've had people that ended up being and you just have to have some sort of what um yeah I feel like an eval functions like how do you measure the success of what the algorithm is doing in Pandora's case like okay do you actually like the songs it's recommending to that's the kind of arbiter of Truth um in a dating app it's like okay well are people liking the matches that are being made or if they're they felt that they were misled that shows up there's got to be some feedback loop there's got to be a way to train the system right that says here's what good looked like and here's what not good looks like Sam you said something like oh they have to tell you the meaning no they don't actually have to tell you the meaning right because the AI can just interpret the meaning summarize the meaning it can it can it can guess the meaning based on whatever the raw the raw text is the public text is so you you could just tell a story about your life and the AI would infer or uh or or place a tag some meanings to the story that you told that uh oh this is about overcoming hardship or this is about whatever um so I don't think you actually have to get the participant to to give you you the meaning but let me ask you darmish like in Pandora's case I don't know how Pandora works but let me just guess for a second like it probably takes the tempo of a song and it's like oh this is a fast tempo song it probably takes you know maybe the key that it's in or something like that that gives you like is this an upbeat and a joyful thing or a sorrowful you know mood song so it gets like mood Tempo artist and like whatever a couple of key characteristics here's like there's instruments um in terms of what's actually in the thing and yes so they he had by the way when they first started they did it all by hand so we had like 500 EX musicians listening to it and like writing down like checking boxes to what it was it was pretty wild this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed the club spot grow better so so let's say they did it they they use attributes and if I want let's say I wanted to do this in fashion I say oh man I love Sam's jacket I want to find some you know similar jackets but can you match this to me one one way would do okay Sam's jacket let's say it's blue it has buttons it has blah blah right it would take attributes and those are attributes the same thing as meaning in this case or is this more for things that are like uh text based and um content you know like content that has some some meaning or does this work for everything it can work for everything and we're still kind of uncovering because this stuff is kind of moving so fast so what you're talking about uh is what we've been using in e-commerce forever today which is a faceted search that I have n number of Dimensions or factors uh size color what type of uh clothing is it all those things and then you kind of do this faceted search um and then we've had kind of pure text based uh the keyword or semantic search this sort of sits in between so instead of having to tell it here all the facets that I'm interested in it kind of pulls those things out that are relevant based on that large language model and this is so the idea of Vector embeddings on and semantic search has been around for a long time that's not new what's new is these new generative models now that are much much better um at understanding all of like documented public human knowledge uh and then using that to say oh like when you use this word when you use coach in the context of um of a relationship you're probably talking about like a therapist it's just a different word right like that's sort of what you're talking about um and Sam you talked about this I think in the last God is um in anyway so it's more about the meaning uh and it infers or figures out what the dimensionality is and that's how it kind of translates into those vectors there's a couple of these companies I just saw one pine cone that's like some Vector these things are getting value 0.3 by the way that's what's that pine cone is the number one vector database so let's say you had to take these vectors and put them in somewhere which you do in order to be able to do searches pine cones the number one most popular uh I think they just raise it like a 700 million dollar valuation or something something there's like three of these that just raise these Mega rounds because and that's you know I don't even I didn't even know this is so funny you just came on here being like let's talk about this super Niche nerdy thing just yesterday I was like uh to do go figure out what a vector database is and why these companies are raising so much money like this is clearly a big deal and I don't know what this I don't know exactly what this means but now now it makes a lot more sense so it comes full circle Sean so you know what maybe it wasn't as geeky as I uh um it's like it's actually useful right you've done an awesome job explaining like the theory and I'm like literally sitting on the edge of my C thinking like this is crazy you answered that question where I said is this like the new internet opportunity wise and you're like yes absolutely but when you're making this stuff what are some of the tools that you're using to you know to actually you said this isn't rocket science and someone could figure this out on a weekend what do you what tools are you using to do all this yeah well I mean so language wise the most commonest python that seems to have emerged as like lingua Franca of the AI world not to say you can't write it in typescript or pick your language of choice um and then tools that are emerging it's still early right the pine code we talked about there's another one called an open source project called Lang chain um Harrison um at the Sequoia event I asked I asked somebody yesterday I was like how do I you know is this a company can we invest because everywhere I look in these like AI hackathons it's all about Lang chain and it's like no it's not really even a company it's just open source project there's a guy who made it but and is running it but it's not even a company correct it's it's not a company yet but you know um and what it does basically is it lets you chain together so right now when we work with large language models we kind of send in a prompt what's called a prompt and you get something back um and then you maybe set it to another thing to do something else and there's like a multi-step process amongst other things Lane chain helps you kind of chain those things together makes it easier for you to kind of work with either an individual large language model like gpt4 or gate class models um and kind of do a lot of the uh kind of connecting the docs and help you with that but it's a super useful Library we missed the chance to give an example more tangible example so you talked about the plugins thing um I think you know example use case here tell me if I'm wrong because I haven't no nobody's well very few people have access to the plugins thing so I'm just kind of sort of guessing but like if you go to chat GPT today and you say hey uh I'm gonna go visit Austin in April um you know make me like I'm there for four days I'm with my family make me a travel itinerary that uh is gonna be fun family friendly uh we want to eat good food and maybe do a little bit of sightseeing but not too much it will spit out a day by day itinerary for you okay that's kind of kind of interesting now let's say oh I need to I'm trying to figure out where to stay um what hotel should I stay at you know here's some things that are important to me and it will give you a table that's like here's option one option two option three here's the cost here's the whatever right it can it can do something like that and with the ability for plugins you can now say cool can you just book that for me and it'll just be like great we have the Expedia Plugin or we have the Airbnb plug-in and it will just go ahead and book it for you and so you know do you need an executive assistant do you need a travel agent when you could do these things do you need you know the same thing with HubSpot or Salesforce oh you know um give me a list of this and it gives you a list of that cool put that in an air table for me and or put that into Salesforce and tag the highest value opportunities as blank it'll just go and do that for you in a sec it'll give you the link to your Salesforce dashboard it's like wow that's kind of cool that no that's a task that some you know I would normally have a human go do because now open AI or chat GPT is not just going to chat you and answer it can do things um as long as the programs that that let you you know they'll build the the interface so that chat GPT can actually interact with those things yeah and this is actually a great example so I think um and we can use that to kind of open up um kind of doors for the of the viewership and listenership which is okay Sage travel which is something we all kind of intrinsically know how it understands and some of us might remember the evolution away from travel agents and the first thing we did when we kind of had web-based kind of travel bookings is uh we treated very transactionally as I'm looking for a flight from X to Y sorted by descending pain sorted by Price whatever happens to be a few stops lowest time whatever it is um and they do a pretty good job of that like most of us have used one of those what's going to be possible now in this kind of new AI world is instead of solving for the transaction you solve for the experience and what I mean by that is that oh if you had an all-knowing assistant that was super smart they scored you got a perfect score on their sat and his was going to go out and they're just like okay what you're really looking for is to solve for this experience you're going to want to stop by this thing and you're going to want to find a hotel that's around a Michelin rated restaurant because you only have 15 minutes to get between this point and that point and I'm going to pull the whole thing together for your own by the way your wife's going with you on this trip I know she likes that right now so nonetheless put you over here but this time then I put you over there oh and by the way I know a week ago you were at this other thing and you had mentioned that you would actually like to follow up with some of those people I'm gonna see if I can make that happen as a like all of that right imagine it knows everything about you it has access to the transactional engines to book the flight has access to all the information to get ratings and reviews and all that comes together in one shot based interface [ __ ] insane this is crazy are you is this why you bought so you bought chat.com right I did as of transfer the domain yesterday last night and you paid you just said eight figures so 10 plus million yes uh unless you're including the dot zero zero as a figure and personally this is a couple things hopefully um so put this uh so if you go to chat.com it will take you to a LinkedIn post that tells me who tells you why I did it and uh solo details so I bought it personally wow and the reason is because of this conversation we're having right now which is I think chat as a experience as an interface is the future right it's like that's the thing um and no intense currently to kind of build something out on it but uh it's the domain I think it was like dormant for like 30 years or something like that and there was kind of came on the market yeah wow and but you so so this is insane I'm reading your post now it's pretty wild do you have are you using HubSpot employees like do you have like a skunks Works team inside of HubSpot that's just working on all this wild stuff or do you have like a side uh LLC or something where you've got like a handful of people on staff and you just say like here's what I'm interested in this week let's see what we can come up with so so wait it's working now is that there will be times um where I'll do something as a hop like wordplay is a good example where I'll build something on the side just for fun for learning whatever it is uh and I put the bill for um for no no HubSpot P L's are harmed um and then there are times where like something kind of winds up being so I started this project called chat spot because I'm obsessed and we'll we'll take a walk down memory lane because I think it's instructive um so I built this application called chatspot.ai and the idea here was you built it or a team uh mostly me I I don't have any front-end design skills I've got some Freelancers on it um so you know uh yeah so I used open ai's apis to build it but my kind of Target goal thing I had in my head is I built it for myself like here are things I need to do all the time and I'm pissed off that I have to do them manually every time and this has been the story of my life for 30 years right like solved my old problems and then other people may or may not find those things uh interesting and useful and so I built it of like okay here are the things I wanted to do like access HubSpot I want to be able to look at my analytes from yesterday or ask questions or look up a domain name where I wanted to see the history of a domain name I like all these things it's like okay well I don't wanna and I have all this software a lot of it just built when I just run it from the command line I do things um and so I then I'm like okay I can wrap this up into a chat chat based interface um and so I've been I've been doing that working on it uh We've made and so but now given the relevance uh to HubSpot uh we're gonna transfer that project's chatspot.ai to be a HubSpot staffed core team this is going to change the world it's going to change the world of CRM um let's go do this which is great so and my my work the whole thing is like this what are you doing with chat.com what's the plan you bought this amazing domain you've redirected it to your LinkedIn post which basically just tells us about the purchase but what are you actually gonna do on the domain I don't know yet that's the honest answer I do not know yet amazing and okay so we can we can help you brainstorm yeah we can we can definitely do that by the way the the chatspot.ai did you go to that Sean it's a it's a simple looking website it's one page and there's a 19 minute video of darmesh sitting in the exact same chair hey it's me and it looks almost like uh I but he's really good at these videos it's almost like he's reading a script but you come off Natural I don't know if it's a script or not but it has 200 000 views and it's a 19 minute video of him talking about what this product is and you do the best combination of like launching something really quickly and getting it out there it's just you on in your chair talking and yet it's like a pretty sophisticated thing and it has 200 000 views on this video over just about that's wild to me you like it's I gotta it's I gotta give you credit darmesh you you are uh kind of amazing like you know you said a bunch of things in this podcast and I don't know how many of them I'm gonna remember maybe the the vector thing because I enjoyed that math lesson but the main thing is I go around my life now and I just looking for people who I'm like I want to be like you when I grow up and I'm just taking little things from them and they could be it could be like a you know a 17 year old kid who's just like doing something awesome on Tick Tock and I'm like I want to be like you when I grow up the guy who made that Kanye vocal like Transformer I was like I want to be like you when I grow up I'm just taking little pieces and you have a couple of things that I think are kind of amazing you have a combination of enthusiasm like you come onto this podcast and you are pumped so you are as excited in year 30 or maybe more in year 30 of your entrepreneurship career as you were in year one and I'm like oh this this is great that's the Fountain of Youth is that enthusiasm so like he's got the enthusiasm then I feel like no matter what's happened no matter how much success you've had you've kept your schedule and your use you invest your time into things you like so like you tinkering on this project whether it's word play last time you came out you told us about that it's like wordle's awesome but I got annoyed with these things so I made a me and my son built this project together and like you know to teach him but also to just make the thing we want and like look at this it kind of works even if it didn't work it would have still been worth it so like having that kind of like I'm always gonna Tinker because that's what I love to do it doesn't matter that I'm the you know top dog at this you know multi-billion dollar public company that doesn't mean I'm gonna stop doing the thing I like to do so I love that I love that aspect of it uh third you are really great at content you do this like dorky form of content that's just like hey it's me I'm gonna show you this thing that I'm pumped about and like you don't overthink it and you just do it whereas like I think most people get really gun shy when it comes to content they're afraid about like you know how to do it what it looks like you're just like oh no I'm just gonna like I'm gonna say the thing that I'm excited about I'm gonna say it and I'm gonna do a screen share it'll just be me and my screen and I'll be talking about what I'm doing and I love that and so uh and then the last one is guts so I feel like you put your money into things you believe in whether it's philanthropy or in this case buying a 10 million dollar plus domain name with no plan like you just said you know it's like you did the the fire Ready Aim it's like yeah I bought the thing and now I get to figure out what the hell I'm gonna do with it and I think that takes a lot of guts and um I don't think you see things as risky as other people see them um and it's not really about like I think the easy way of saying it would be oh yeah well it's you know that's nothing to him he's got a lot of money uh yeah I don't think that's true and I know a lot of people with a lot of money and they don't do things like this where they just put their money behind things that they're in they believe in or they're interested in or almost like would you I don't know if you would agree with this it's almost like you antied up so that now you're forced almost to do something awesome and interesting and this space that you think has a lot of potential but then there's this in this last thing is this rare combination of like and I mean this in a polite way of which I am also that like this nerdy nerdiness quirkiness of like I'm just doing it because it's cool plus I'm I this way can make money I mean you have a way that makes yeah you have this company that has close to two million and 2 billion in revenue and is a commercial success and then Artistry of like I'm just just like it's beautiful this is awesome I'm gonna do this it's a very rare combination how do you respond to all these compliments um I'll say this the lesson kind of I've learned over the years um and I think this is if I had to kind of share any kind of advice um over the you know the 30 years is that when what I've done best is when I've had the courage of my convictions of something that I believe in so I'm going to tell you like a quick story of uh the road that led to me buying a uh 10 plus million dollar domain name I almost like said the number actual number out loud I have to kind of catch myself but um and so 17 years ago I had like this is before HubSpot um I had this idea and the idea was um everyone was using kind of email and Outlook back then this is before the iPhone before all the things it's like you know what like business software is really hard to talk to I'm gonna do it just like I would email my assistant I didn't have an assistant but let's assume I did uh you know I just want to be able to do that and type an email up is have her like oh I have this file in our shared file server and SharePoint somewhere can you send me a link to that file about to hop on a plane I need that for the sales call I'm gonna go on for for a meeting tomorrow or I'm on the plane coming back uh I just ran to this person whatever I've got their business card right here this is before the iPhone and you can do OCR and things like that it's like I'm just gonna type that in and send it like just add this to to like contact you know database whatever and the beauty of email was it already had a disconnected model we had already figured that out which is oh you can be on a plane I have no interfa internet type all emails you want respond to all the emails you want and then when you get connection it does all the things right this is like automatic uh synchronized database essentially and I call the product in general mail uh and that's what I was going to do before that's why I was like Hey like that that would be an interesting thing and then five years ago like okay well that in general mail thing the core of it was a good idea but it emails the wrong condo it actually needs to be like a web-based tool but the or slack which I did both so I built this product called growth box talked about on the inbound stage got thousands of users you threw it out there and it was awesome except for one thing it didn't work it like it couldn't actually do the natural language understanding um that I wanted it to do despite my best I used products that you Google called dialogue flow I use products from Facebook um we used open search projects to try and crack the nut of taking texts and understanding what the hell the user was trying to do anyway so that failed um and then you know when GPT comes along I'm like oh you know that thing I've been thinking about for 17 years that actually is now possible so I started working on chatspot.ai I'm like okay it took 17 years but I sort of proved myself right I had the courage of my convictions all the way through to never let go of that one idea and then chat.com comes along it's like okay it's like deep down inside I will give you the true honest to goodness reason I bought it the reason I bought it and this is I think a phrase Charlotte you just use it's like oh no I think Sam he just used it it's the antique so I'm trying to get into the AI party all the AI parties and I'm nobody in that particular party right I've done some things in some places fine but that particular group of people has no idea who I am not really um so chat spot moves me in that direction it's like oh some people have seen that video awesome chat.com for let's say I even break even let's say I lose a few million dollars it is worth the price of admission for me just because that pays the cover charge I was like okay this guy gets it for him to spend that kind of money on chat ux which Bill Gates just talked about last week as the new thing uh so you should read that article but I guess just did an article around why he is so excited about those Jared of AI stuff he told the entire story of how he came across on Alden and open AI the challenge he put together and his I'm gonna paraphrase he said when we went from dos to Windows which is we went from a character-based interface to a graphical Mouse based click and touch interface that's the thing we built Microsoft on which lasted for decades and then he said since then there has been nothing in technology that has come along literally he said nothing that has come along that has made add or will make as big of an impact as this natural language interface to software it's the biggest thing we've seen and hencechat.govs what happened I don't know but the one of the story is how the courage of your convictions if you truly truly believe in an idea and you fundamentally think you're right iterate don't just sit go down your rabbit hole tell everybody you can about it build products around it find other like-minded folks and try to pull on that thread um but you ever quit HubSpot and just spend all your time on this stuff I don't really need to right it's uh it's I enjoy what I do at HubSpot I think I add value there on that and a dollar salary so it's not the not the money at all like even on the like the chat spot thing at the time that I built it it was experimental I'm like okay I'm not sure if there's actually a cruise into something that would be valuable to HubSpot say spent like half a million dollars plus um like freelance developers and open AI license fees and all the things that need to go into launching a product like that and I'll end up giving it to HubSpot for a dollar right I'm not looking yeah but aren't you aren't you like I don't want to be weighed down by this baggage of like having to worry about CRM stuff or uh you know your technical you're you're the title your title is CTO like I don't want to have to talk to certain people uh and take up meetings on like the future of this particular product instead I just wanted to just nerd out on all this other stuff but I do that now so I got one thing one of the things I've this is a personality call it a tree slash flaw is that I spend most of my life trying to configure the universe to my liking that's I mean all our players really do this right that's one of the reasons that they kind of go into startup land is the freedom and the control to do the things you want to do and so I've kind of crafted a role for myself within HubSpot that allows me to do exactly the things that I want to do and not do any of the things I don't want to do which is one-on-one meetings and I have to manage people have no direct reports so I've never filled out an expense sheet like I do none of that I feel I feel I don't know about you Sean I feel like I feel like I want to quit everything I'm doing like he's just persuaded me I just watched yesterday no it's over I feel it's over so here's my advice to you fam it's um dude I mean do you feel this way Sean I don't know sorry dartmash go ahead no so my advice to you is Hampton's a cool idea uh with actual utility and I um Sean you said this in the last thing like this could be a 100 million dollar business worth anywhere from 300 million dollars to a billion plus dollars and I think you're right um if you're excited about some of the new technology developments that's happening I think the best thing you can do is intersect the two things it's like okay I'm gonna build Hampton and I'm gonna take the things that I know I know how to build communities I know how to build these kinds of businesses now can I intersect that with things that are happening in the technology sector around AI or veteran whatever it happens to be and then it can somehow merge those two things because then you'd be an Unstoppable Force right because no one in the community building uh market doing niche market communities is thinking about or having conversations about Vector embeddings I promise you that um it would so you don't have to give up one for the other you can say yep I'm gonna do that I'm gonna do it better than anyone's look how else has ever done it um so but I I have a different advice for you Sam I think just get dug in into your position instead I remember when you were doing the hustle originally and Snapchat came out and Instagram was like popping off on videos and and Facebook had videos and then there was other media companies that were raising tons of money that were just like we're gonna produce short form video content or live video content on top of Facebook and cheddar was all the rage and all the stuff and I was like dude why aren't you doing videos man look at this look at these guys they're getting millions of views on their videos on Facebook or these guys are getting millions of views on the Snapchat story feed um you could be the first one there it fits your audience and you were like just very steadfast you're like uh like you're you're your principal you were like three things number one don't understand it a lot yeah I don't really understand it I understand this other thing two I could try to figure it out but I don't want to build on top of their platforms because they changed the rules all the time I have friends who got burned by that I don't want to get burned by that same thing I don't want to build on a shaky Foundation I'd rather do email because I own the thing uh I own the relationship with with the audience and um it's not like the Facebook algorithm changes one tweak away from from putting me out of business and I remember being like man this guy's like Stone Mr Stone Age like he is just not not an integrated or adapting to the new [ __ ] and I was like I would there's no way if I was running the hustle I would have been able to resist the shiny object of like video on mobile phones and like in terms of the video mobile phones did turn out to be a big thing but a lot of those companies media companies got absolutely wrecked and you were right for for being wary of it um and more more I don't think in this case People Are Gonna Get Wrecked because it's not like you know the analogy is not one to one but I would say you know Warren Buffett missed the internet and all of technology and still did Fantastic Sam I think you're going to be in that same boat where like it is not really in your nature to get really interested in you know New Frontier Technologies and play with them and try to integrate them and that's not really your nature and you're better you're best served by like knowing your nature and just doubling down on what's a working formula for you I guess so so I would do that I appreciate that because there's going to be a trillion people trying to do fancy AI [ __ ] who are better suited to do that and it's gonna be an absolute bloodbath for you know for for like go look right now at the number of AI tools that are coming out every single day um and you know it's like most of them do seem [ __ ] though right I mean like it doesn't matter there's just swarms that they're all gonna get just like wiped out every GPT release wipes out a whole wave of like even the successful ones because it's like oh now that's just a feature of chat GPT and so I I don't know I I think it's like know your nature and like you know it's okay to not have to do every new thing uh unless that's your nature unless like like for darwash it is his nature for me it is a lot more my nature than it is is yours and there's pros and cons that come with that and so I think are you uh are you gonna go in I mean Sean Sean's got a new idea that he's taken with and he's been telling me a little bit about that I have one piece of tactical advice I have to share with you Sam on All right yeah yeah so I'm going through the application process on Hampton last night like 2 A.M um and this is super tactical but this is what we do here on MFM uh tip number nine on the application process is what's your real question mark it's a required question good the subtext is CEOs Founders and partners only please that's the subtext the options are founder CEO owner and other the one thing I would tweet if I were you so what you're doing is you're saying hey we're about Founders and owners and if you're not one of them don't bother thank you for not bothering go away so focus is a magical thing I love that but you're doing what I call a pre-filter right which is why not say oh this is for CEOs owners or whatever don't make them feel guilty for going through the rest of the process because there may be a future version of Sam and Hampton that says oh you know what we solved this problem but that same problem around people needing therapy from peer groups that applies a lot to like VPS of product um and that Community right now all the only communities they can find are people that want to talk about product management and no one wants to talk about relationships and there's an opportunity there and so it costs you literally nothing they'll still answer the question it'll be sitting in your database for a year or forever and it costs you nothing uh don't don't push them out too early it should have been the way you suggested apparently I didn't give that feedback Grant if you're listening uh please [Laughter] yeah but Sean you're telling me thank you dumbass Sean you were telling me about stuff that you're thinking about yeah and it was pretty it was somewhat old school like what you're the thing yeah so are you like questioning that after this conversation and you're like oh man this is like not after this conversation necessarily but it's a snowball that's building right like there's a reason I cleared my calendar to just mess around with AI all week because I'm interested in it and when you it's like let's go see what's real there and I did the same thing with crypto during that during uh you know when crypto was really interest intriguing I was like okay let me go try to Mint an nft let me go try to actually like use defy and see what's going on here and what parts make sense and what parts don't make sense oh that was pretty frictionless like that's cool that I could just like get a loan and one button and I could pay it back in one button I never had to talk to a human being like I really like that um hey this thing says the yield is 20 I don't really understand where they would get 20 from so not sure but I'm gonna you know put a small amount of money in just to learn know I was I was trying to play with it trying to think for myself is the big idea and and it's not like some binary thing like is crypto good is crypto bad it's like I want to know where it's at right now I want to see it develop and my best way to do that is immersion I actually stole this from the from Bill Gates Bill Gates does his reading week where he goes to a cabin and he reads a [ __ ] ton of books for a week about one topic that it's like been on his mind but he hasn't had the appropriate amount of time to roll up his sleeves and dig in and I was like oh that but without books just give me a you know Pro browser and I'm good to go and so um so that's what we've been doing and there genuinely are so many like mind-blowing moments and also just like um just understanding the nuances of things so for like just being able to think like the computer like you know you were talking about these facets for example so I was playing around with mid-journey like Sam do you know what mid journey is or do you know how to use it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean I I just been goofing off and I'll just be like show me what uh Cartman from South Park looks like as a real person right and like you know I was like and I was the way I approached it was can I replace work that I already want to do with a more efficient AI workflow that was like one of the things and then it was what's really fun random [ __ ] I could do I wanted to be on those ends of the spectrum like highly utilitarian for me so it's like oh I need a logo for my thing but I don't want just like a logo I want to create a whole brand all right how can I use AI to create a whole brand here so from the the icons to t-shirt designs to a website can I do that with just Ai and not have to touch it does not have to hire a single designer and can I do that with just like my own imagination and this prompt thing and then oh how do you do prompting and like which of these tools is the best what's the difference so that was like one whole area another was like we took the podcast and we did this thing that was kind of sick we took the podcast and we ran it through this thing so we took the Pod and we then used open AI has something called whisper which transcribes any video so it's like put in a YouTube link to this tool it'll take a whisper and it'll give you the transcript all right cool it takes the transcript then I put it into chat GPT and we had this guy write this little prompt for us like we had to get the right prompt but he wrote this prompt that was awesome which was basically like it's pretty funny it goes because Chad GB can only take so many characters so it goes I'm gonna I'm Gonna Give You 19 text sections I don't want you to do anything until you're at section 19. um so ignore everything until I'm done with 19 and then answer the prompt that I give you and chat to be saying okay I will I will wait for the 19 Parts a copy paste part one two three four all the way to 19 and then you go the prompt is I want you to pull out every idea story and framework that's discussed in this podcast I want you to summarize it and I want you to tell me does this idea exist already or not exist so it can guess based on the way we were talking about it are we talking about something we saw that exists or just an idea that somebody should go do um so like from this pod it would be like uh using Vector um using using this this Vector you know uh Dimensions or whatever you added Vector engine or whatever to uh potentially create a dating site um that would match people in ways that they're you know sort of similar um using using Ai and it would be like does this idea exist no who is the source of this uh darmesh um what was the the synopsis of the idea blank what is the category that it's in Ai and so it then it took that and it takes the whole episode and it just created a database of every story framework and idea from the thing with these tags and now a human can go back and like tweak them if something was wrong but like that's a lot of the work that was done uh and I we could just do this for the whole back back catalog of our podcast and so I'm trying to use it first for my own benefit and then along the way if I see a business a startup idea that I'm like oh somebody should productize this or somebody should um do whatever like you know the simple example is this Kanye thing I was like why is this not the most viral app in the world right now that basically it's an app with a one button that says so you know say something and then it's gonna when you when you let go of that button it's gonna turn it into Kanye saying that thing and go share that to tick tock and like you might get sued but you will go viral right that's the trade there but I'm like that's crazy there's no front end for this really cool you know AI demo that exists now um so yeah I'm just right now I'm in the go play around with it see if anything really really strikes me and if something does then then then take the next steps there's one thread in there Sam uh Sean that I I think we should pull on which is you used um you talked about this kind of crafting of the prompt in order to kind of make the thing do what you needed to do um and that's entirely new skill now called prompt engineering right uh and it's it's analogous to software engineering so software engineering is getting a computer to do what you want by speaking to it in its language and that way you can kind of get the results you're looking for prompt engineering is almost exactly the same thing except you're talking to a large language model something like the gpt4 to kind of get it to produce so you're talking to AI to get it to produce the thing that you want um and so I think this is another opportunity for uh folks that are kind of Technology minded but not like software Engineers right so they they kind of can think about the problems of their head they're good at and they may be good writers they may be good analysts they may be good at kind of describing the Fate but like pump engineering is going to be like another big um like a big thing and by the way it's uh as long as we're dropping things uh so I bought two domains recently um yeah buy one get one free yeah I wish um but this one thought it's not eight Figures it's seven figures and the domain is prompt.com and this one I actually have an idea around what to kind of what to do with that which is there's going to be this entire you're not going to get into details of it yet because it's too good of an idea to actually just kind of put out there in the world and I'm not I'm not ready yet to do something about it but uh one second by the way prompt prompt.com goes to like a coaching for essays I know I know there's the transfer is still happening I don't have the domain in my possession yet but the the deal is done right dude so your your per your portfolio of domains I mean mid eight figures then yeah tens of Millions oh yeah [ __ ] insane dude I feel amped I I like when we were talking when we were talking to pomp I like wanted to go like hide under the covers because he freaked me out about uh the billion or the million dollar Bitcoin thing and the banks with this thing I'm like I gotta clear my schedule I gotta go learn all about this I mean I feel amp this is awesome before we go give us your two minute reaction to balaji's warning slash bet that the US dollar will crash and uh Bitcoin will surge to one million dollars I'll say this uh and I don't know him personally but he's like quite literally one of the top five people I've ever encountered like even on the internet there's raw what I call wattage it's just raw horsepower and uh he he's like an EIN to himself right like he just uh just the knowledge that he has having said that um I think I understand why he's taking the extreme positions because that's sometimes what you have to do to kind of shake the world out of its reverie and it's like okay uh pay attention here this is important um but if I'm a betting person I would not bet that the odds are um what what do you think they are um could happen but nowhere near the probability that uh that he's suggested I feel better now I feel better you're I I like your opinion better therefore I think it's true okay we should rap on this because one of the things that happens anytime new technology comes along we saw this a little bit in um in the kind of crypto web free world as well is that um entrepreneurial United folks will see this kind of new thing and they will look for kind of a quick turnaround I'm all for creating value quickly but it has to be like creating value don't play the Arbitrage oh I'm gonna do this thing this is like you know day trading back in the day or whatever it's like don't be a grifter right like B yeah like just don't take advantage of people there's enough real problems to solve where real money can be made and yes uh this technology can now be used in creative ways um by lots of people and you should use those um but don't use as an excuse uh just to kind of be a like an AI tourist that comes through makes a little bit of money or whatever and then that was that there's this there's a big opportunity I think you're shortchanging yourselves uh if that's what you end up doing so well thank you dharmash um thank you for coming this is awesome man yeah yeah well thank you for coming on the Pod this is awesome I uh I feel pumped man I I always like talking to you um I don't know if you know this Sean I slacked our mesh all the time I'll just be like I'm just trying to get him to like give me little like crumbs of information because I didn't get into the HubSpot Slack it's awesome I'll just like just send something his way just hopefully I can get something back uh but it's fascinating and I feel lucky to be able to have you as a friend and uh co-worker and and this is awesome in a podcast guess you're this is so fascinating and I agree with what Sean said about like kind of like looking up to you and like looking at how people live their lives you're definitely someone I admire so I'm I'm happy you came here thanks thanks for having me on again this is fun as always awesome all right thanks for coming on that's it that's the pod [Music]

I will predict and guarantee really that this is going to be a greater than 100 million dollar a year Revenue business which means it's going to be worth something like low end 300 400 million high-end billion dollars [Music] all right we are live sorry I missed last week how to do a thing but today's a big day for me I'm launching my thing I'm finally talking about the thing that I've been working on it's called Hampton joinhampton.com uh I'm I'm excited this is your Steve Jobs moment dude is it every once in a while something comes along that changes everything [Laughter] triangle hand pose yeah I'm just gonna start a city like that this is the first time that I've been working on something that I haven't talked about it like within 24 hours of having the idea and it's killed me it's killed me and I have hated it I've hated it I'm so nervous and so why now so I'll give people background so my new company that I've been working on I think I've been working on it since July but I've had the idea for a long time and I like even interviewed people in this space on the Pod so by the way that's the funniest part of this whole thing you invited people out of the podcast ask them every hey uh how do you run your business how do you grow it what are the numbers how much money does it make how'd you start it Where'd you hire from blah blah blah and then you just launched a competitor like 90 days later it's not a competitor so we had a chief on this is not a competitive Chief we had tiger 21 on not a competitor there to them but yeah so I wanted to prove because I you remember how I said I hate the question when people say how would you start if you could do it over again yada yada and I would tell them they go well it's easy for you have an audience and so I was like all right well I'll just do it in front of you and just to prove to myself and this little chip I have on my shoulder that I can create stuff without an audience so Hampton is the URL is join Hampton I couldn't get hampton.com uh it's like owned by the Holiday Inn or whatever the Marriott company or whatever it is um but it's it's pretty simple it's a vetted Network for Founders and entrepreneurs so basically if you're a Founder our sweet spot is like if you're the CEO of a company our sweet spot is like 10 million a year in Revenue but you need at least a million in Revenue at least three million in funding or well these are all over explain what it does before yeah what's what I'm going to so what I'm saying is you need like it's for a certain size of CEO but basically you sign up we vet you and I'll an interview and all this stuff and what you get is basically what you and I had so before Sean and I started this pod before he started this pod him and I would meet once a month it would be me you and like five or six other guys and we would like it was basically like group therapy for business and we did it for a couple of years and then we did it informally for a long time and I've done it I've done it informally with a bunch of people but it kind of changed my life and so we decided my partner Joe and I to create that but for people who are all over the country so if you're in Idaho and you have this company that does like 20 million in Revenue you're kind of like a freak you're like an outsider in your community and so what we did was we made this thing where you can sign up get vetted and we put you in a group of eight to ten people with a executive coach we call them facilitators who guide conversations that you have once a month and then there's a hampton-wide community that you um can talk to other people anytime and then we're we host dinners so we have like dozens of dinners we have uh Adventures so like a bunch of members are going to a rally car event next week and so we do all these things but basically it's like I hate using this but it's almost like a safe space so we have people like posting you went there I really care about this business I went there it's like a place where you could like talk to your would you say that yours feel seen you can bring your whole self but you can bring your work self and your personal self but it's like a place where like let's say you have to lay people off you can you can ask people publicly and No One's Gonna Make fun of you like I have to lay people off how do I do this or you could be like I'm bummed I'm really sad I have to lay people off or the opposite you're like I'm killing it money is coming in how are you folks investing and so when I had my group I used to do one with you and I did one with my now partner Joe Spicer like he knew my net worth he knew my relationship issues with friends and family he knew when I was selling the company I was like dude how do I not look stupid when I'm selling this this company I like I I I feel very ashamed about X Y and Z and so it's this place where you can it's kind of like this pod but more intimate and uh that's kind of why we had the idea I didn't want to launch it publicly because a I wanted the product to be perfect like I wanted it to be great and B communities like this it's not like software where you just throw bodies at it and it doesn't matter how many people are using it we had to like really be careful so we've added all these awesome people and we like it was very hand curated and it still will be but like I wanted to be like that early on and so um so I think you pitched it and you almost didn't do yourself Justice there you know when people come on the Pod and you're like well let me just do that for you real quick that's dude this is my nerd man yeah yeah I feel like the nerves are getting the best of you because uh here's how I would explain this I think you got the I think you got one part right which was most important the most important thing which was you were a customer of a product like this before you built this business you didn't just build this business because you're like oh this might be a great idea uh when we met I don't know 10 years ago almost it was through something like this we created a group it was me it was you Jack Smith who went on to sell his business for like I don't know 700 800 900 million dollars uh but at the time he he wasn't in that spot um a guy named sieva who was at the time doing this kind of class notes College business that wasn't really gonna end up being that big but his next thing uh enduring Adventures has turned out to be pretty big so it's a 100 million dollar plus company now um there was a small group of us and we would meet twice a month and there was one really important thing that it did which was it gave you like you said the safe space now what is it safe from well for most CEOs most of the time um I would say most people think starting a business is hard or being a CEO is hard but they think about the beginning like oh it must be hard to like get the idea or get it off the ground and like as anybody who's actually done it knows that's like one percent of the journey like the hard part is actually the climb it's like once you've got your idea and you're running it yeah like now seven years of day to day with a bunch of unknowns and a bunch of like fires that are going to pop out of nowhere and you have to you have to put out those fires and just staying happy and healthy insane and being who you are during that seven year climb is actually the hard part and so who helps you during that climb is I think the important part and you know the hard thing if you're a CEO is you talk to investors you got to tell them everything's great everything is up and up and up um we're crushing it you talk to your customers you need to tell them how great everything is you talk to your employees or your teammates in the office every day you can't be telling them about all your problems uh you have to again tell them how great everything is so this was for us this was the one group or you could just say how things actually are this is what's going good this is what's going bad I don't even really know about this other thing I gotta figure that out I've been procrastinating that just because it's like looming and I don't I don't really know what to do and it is this founder group therapy thing where you sit down with you know six or seven other people and uh I would say it's like 70 the conversation is like 70 tactics thirty percent dude I've been there you know don't worry about this like the therapy but the value is almost on the other side it's like uh the connections that you make um you know the ideas that you get the relationships like you know sieve ended up uh you know being one of my groomsmen I think in my wedding uh you know we invested in a bunch of companies from The Mastermind and that made a bunch of money uh you know had I not been in a mastermind with you I wouldn't have seen how you built the hustle and I wouldn't have known how to build the milk Road a business I didn't know I was planning to create five years later but that blueprint was etched in my brain from those meetings and so you get all these like kind of crazy um outsized benefits and basically I think most people massively overrate the idea of a mentor because I think it sounds like the easy button it's like man I wish that there was just some some genius who knew everything and had done everything who could just tell me what to do and solve all my problems and of course that doesn't really exist uh but like so mentors are pretty overrated but peers I think are massively underrated and what you've done is basically curate a bunch of people who are like you so if you're in that kind of like I've got a successful business I'm on my seven year climb I want to make this as big and as generational as I can you want other people who have already done that or also in that Journey with you doing that at the same time so that's my my sales pitch for you you've done it better than me uh you've absolutely thank you you've done it way better than I did it's just like well well the other thing is I'm in the thick of it too I'm not doing this really for you I remember the first piece of viral content I had was me writing how I set my how I set up our Mastermind how we ran it and how you should like if you want to do that too here's how you should do it and this was like I had some crappy PDF somewhere um but it's been downloaded like I don't know 10 000 times now wow I don't even know where those emails are I should go find them but like that thing has had like ten thousand ten thousand downloads now in a couple years because and I don't promote this thing it's just I said it once on a podcast a long time ago at the very beginning of this and consistently people it resonates people are like I want that how do I how do I set mine up so I can have my own version of what you have now what you did you made it easy you made it a product you were like don't worry about figuring out how to find the right people how to organize this how to make sure the discussion is not a huge waste of everyone's time and it's super productive you just turned that into push a button and if you're accepted in you you get all that out of the box which is smart and I used your thing I I used that uh the down or the list that you're talking about I used um just my experience with our thing and then I went and studied it you know I was talking to a lot of other of these groups and trying to figure out I've been calling it speed of vulnerability how do we like get people to be vulnerable quickly and it sounds weird but we have like people like crying at some of these things and I'm like yes yes got him tears fuel me yeah the tears of my customers well particularly men like men are like I'll have like some people afterwards they're like this was amazing why haven't other people done this I'm like yeah dude it's called therapy like people have done this for years and just a lot of men in particular don't do this type of stuff that's why I haven't joined I don't want to cry last time I cried somebody gave me a titty twister and I just decided after that day it's not happening again um so yeah I've been avoiding your your emotional trap here uh for a little bit by the way this is not just something you studied like oh there's these three companies that started in the last 10 years that do this um this is like on some Benjamin Franklin right like this is a I think uh junto or junto I don't know what he called I don't know how you pronounce it but like back in the day this was like a Ben Franklin thing even every Friday he would go to this like one bar you might know the story better than I do I'll kind of butcher do it but he went to this bar every Friday and he invited a community of like-minded people and he called it I think a society a a club of mutual benefit like benefit or something like that which is basically meant it's a club of people who we are going to make each other better um like I want sparring partners when it comes to business it's kind of the way that that that you you think about it or I think about it uh but he was doing the same thing his was a little less A Little Less business oriented it's a little more like uh topics of you know society and law and whatever like they would just debate random things um but he like attributed a lot of his success to doing this regularly to having this regular recurring meeting with peers who played the game at a high level and that makes you know iron sharpens iron type of thing and so um yeah this is not like a new idea that's been around for a little while how do you think about how this Compares so people have heard of oh YPO they've heard of whatever these other ones tiger 21 vistage all all these things how does it compare I know I I have my opinion you might have to be politically correct around how you say all this like no no no we're all different in our own special way but like I see you as the sexier modern more fun version that I would want to be a part of is that not like it or is it is it much different my whole career my like 15-year internet career it's been based on like taking old ideas and just putting new spins on it and so like that's what we did with newsletters newsletters have been around before the internet and we just put a different spin on it and people are like oh you created this amazing interesting new thing I'm like no not really it's not that new it just we just like you know put a different logo on it and we had our texture we added our texture to it and we did the same thing with this one but like I if I make fun of these other companies I'm only joking because they serve a need but like there's YPO so YPO has been around since the 50s it's a really big business but YPO it's like 50 and 60 year old men and we make a joke at Hampton where we're like not a lot of people in our group their businesses aren't inheriting 15 apartment buildings in South Florida uh YPO exists for that and YPO does have like a lot of like tech people and internet people but it is a little the age range is much older it is a little bit more boys club YPO without Cialis [Laughter] yeah I can say these things because it's not my business and they're cool and all but they're just they're just older and so uh Hampton it's it's digital first uh so like we have d2c companies who aren't tech companies and we're like should we call it tech companies and like they're technically not tech companies but they're tech companies if you call if you tell your mom what you do so they're like tech companies internet companies that's where they are a lot of people who you recognize on Twitter are members so that type of stick um uh a lot of like just consumer software companies a lot of B2B software companies but almost everyone's software or internet based um and it's significantly younger than a lot of uh of these older companies and then compare it to like a mastermind which I don't even use that word those are typically like 50 a lot of them can be like 50 Grand and it's a little bit more internet marketing so this is very much like a startup so let's do the internet I think the best sales pitch like with any Community is who else who am I doing bad no no you're doing good I just want to make sure I get you to the good bits right I'm I'm your wingman here I'm trying to get you laid here so here let me let me help you out it says on your website your website's nice by the way I want to talk about one thing in a second here which is that you did this differently than your other stuff you like hired a fancy design agency and you like picked a good name you like built it in stealth you like violated a bunch of your own rules which I think is kind of awesome I want to hear about those in a second but first uh it says the average Hampton member has 23 million in annual revenue and then there's some minimum um and like any Community the most valuable thing is who else is here because that's what I would care about right like okay you uh I like the idea I always like the idea it's like any I like the idea of a party but who's coming and so who are give me like I don't know three four five however many you want like give me some stories of interesting members you've met um that have made this like fun for you to come under Community for even you to be a part of I'm gonna give you two categories one the people who you know and then two the people you don't know the people you do know covers everybody pop that covers 100 of the pie chart dude so like uh pomp Anthony who was on the Pod a few weeks ago he's a member so pomp has a media company and an investment company and you guys have if you listen to the party you know who he is Patrick Campbell bootstrapped his company profit well to like a 200 million dollar exit your friends uh bump Health you know bump health of course they make uh yeah they well you know uh what's the same um Leland uh his wife Christine's a member uh they they bootstrap their company to tens of millions in revenue and they create uh it's a prescription for pregnant women yeah yeah uh CB insights Anon from CB insights one of the most impressive people I've ever gotten to hang out with very level-headed and but like just quietly building you know uh CD insights I have you heard that Lil Wayne Uh quote where he's like real G is moving silence like lasagna that's that that's a non um Austin Reef he's in my group so my former enemy now one of my closest friends Austin Reef from morning Brew is a member Nick Huber sahil sieva all these types of people but let me tell you about the people who you probably don't know have I ever told you about Brett Adcock uh if you've mentioned this guy because he took some flying car company public or something like that but tell the story all right listen to this so this guy named Brett Adcock he started this thing called veteri which was a Marketplace for talent but it was very much like hired so if you're an engineer you go through all these tests they kind of like algorithmically and kind of manually match you with cool interviews they eventually bought hired he sold it for 100 million dollars he took a bunch of his earnings from that and he started Archer which he took public at the time for like 2 billion market cap now is like six or seven hundred million but it was a flying car company basically they kind of look like helicopters but they're like unmanned uh flying things that United Airlines bought a bunch of and he took time off between veteri and Archer to study how it worked he literally went to like University of Florida to like learn how this works now his latest company which I'm a personal investor of is called a figure and I went to his Factory and he's like and they basically are these robots that look like Robocop and instead of killing you though they just uh you know load t-shirts into packages for Walmart Walmart's a hypothetical one and they ship ship it off so you know there's like millions of people who are doing this who are getting paid yeah what do you call it yeah Pick and Pack there's 20 000 of these three PLS in in America did you know that I didn't know there's twenty thousand yeah we ran one right so I hired a bunch of people to do this I've done a lot of Pick and Pack myself because people call in sick to work it's crazy so he's built these robots that could basically run they call them humanoids and he's like they can run for 20 hours a day they charge for four hours a day and they're just packing stuff and it's all using robots but he took like 20 or 30 million dollars of his own money and he was like I basically own two stocks or one stock Archer my publicly my public company and then all the cash that I have I bought a house and then I put invested all of it into figure my new company this guy's like all in on it it's pretty wild another interesting person we talked about Anya of rooted she's the one person meditation app it's a panic attack app that does over a million in Revenue so it goes all the way from folks like Brett who are on their ways to be billionaires all the way down to Anya who's got a million dollar thing that she's slow growing slowly but she owns 100 of it another interesting one AJ Patel another guy who's pretty under the radar pause guy yeah he bootstrapped zesty Paws to a 600 million dollar exit now he has a new thing called high key we talked about him a lot he's he's pretty baller and so how does it work these people you get put in a group of peers uh so you get you apply you get accepted you get matched into a group and then you meet once a month with a facilitator who guides that discussion right yeah and the meetings have these like uh like we've like like we review each meeting afterwards and we like study what's the good what's the bad and then we've just shaped the um the format so what makes a great meeting versus uh just okay meeting so what I learned from the podcast is basically these meetings are basically content so I try to find juicy good content so a really good meeting we do this thing called the business breakdown well someone will like do a SWOT analysis strengths weaknesses opportunities um what's the other T threats uh on their on their business and they'll explain how it works what their CAC is where they're getting customers and they just reveal everything and they're like here's where we suck here's what we rock what do you think I should do and here's the issue that I'm facing and so that's a really good meeting when they do that so triple whale you one of your uh best investments of all time he's uh he's a member and they'll just explain how the companies works and they're like on on paper and this is no threats for Triple A yeah this what I must say is not from for Max is for everyone uh what they'll say is like it's going well but like we're sucking here here and here or we're about to lay people off or uh we just got an acquisition offer and it's way below our valuation whatever uh and so they like will Ex and so people will have all types of contacts on their companies to in order to give advice so that's a good meeting and then we've hired how many do we have we probably have 30 or 40 facilitators on staff right dude and that's hard wrangling these people up is hard and like training them so it's been like a that's been the biggest challenge and that's our biggest cost is is trying to figure out how to get these people to do stuff well now let's talk about how you decided to start this so again I think if I had said what is the Sam par startup method I would have said um the first bit I think was was kind of correct which was sniff around for the opportunity I think you are a world-class you know Hound sniffer yeah top five sniffer I know easily uh so you're good at finding opportunity and that what that means is you talk to a bunch of people and you bluntly ask them be like is that a good business and then they're like well yeah I mean we did this much in Revenue you're like oh I was just asking but thanks for telling me you do a good job of basically finding interesting models or you know that or businesses that you think are good businesses so at that part I think was straight out of a straight out of your normal Playbook and so you did a good job with that then you were like okay I could see this business and I think you even like talked to somebody who had bought a company like this like private equity and you were like yeah why'd you buy I don't call them how do they grow well year by year what's your plan with them um would you buy another was this like a one-off outlier or are there other businesses like this and you're you basically Got Confidence so those some of your method uh dude I called the guy and I was like look hey uh I just got I found your number on the internet I I don't want to sound like a douchebag here but here's who I am so I'm kind of like legit and I'm gonna create something that I have a feeling you're gonna want to buy I don't know if I'm ever gonna sell it but I have a feeling you're gonna want to so it's it it makes sense for you to have it talk with me right now and I have a particular set of skills well thankfully taken speech very humbly I was trying to be very humble but yeah and he like told me a little bit about the business he didn't reveal anything that I I mean I could have found a lot of it online uh but he didn't it's not like broken the like confidentiality stuff but yeah I did that and then I just created a type form and I created a Google doc I just wrote out in one page what my new idea is who should join who shouldn't join and at the bottom was a type form and I sent that Google doc to like 50 friends and like 20 of them signed up and I interviewed all of them so I actually took a screenshot look at my calendar you see my calendar down here no my calendar it's like a zebra there's like Stripes basically I did like it weird flex but all right got that zebra calendar I got that zebra counter basically and like there's no meetings of the day that you'll see there's no meetings on the day we record the the Pod but besides that there's like 10 to 15 meetings every single non-mfm day yeah and I would just bought you one of those Bluetooth headsets like you were a telemarketer because I was like I think Sam is just doing these like 20 minute calls all day like for a while you were doing that right you were doing basically only 30 minute sales call or Discovery call um every day all day because we used to be completely unscheduled right like we had that elephant schedule it was just clear gray nothing there and I could call you anytime we could have a little chit chat it was fine and then all of a sudden you started this business and you became the machine was it hard to became the machine was it hard to flip the switch or in a way I here's my suspicion in a way you kind of missed that and it felt fun to go like super like hardcore about it it was awesome but it was hard it was like lifting weights like during it like I was proud to do it and I was happy to do it but it was very challenging and so I was like doing all these calls and I would interview people figure out who is interesting who's not interesting who we should turn away who we should accept and then we just sent a stripe link and we accepted payment and then we said all right you have a 30-day delay we went out and found the executive coaches the facilitators we trained them and then the first meeting started and we did that for about a hundred people without any website and we didn't create a website until around December and when we created a website correct mindset no yeah many seven figures in Revenue uh uh the way you're talking about money is so funny many many centimeters humans don't talk like this millions millions in run rate it was like we were doing good I was doing good it was just me and Joe so basically he would go out and find the facilitators and I would go out and like find the uh by the way there's a great story here because if you actually go to the website ceomastermind.com same business idea that you're doing right now was a business I started at the very beginning of the podcast very Loosely I uh I was like hey this Mastermind thing is really great uh it's helped me a lot in my life anybody want to join one and create one here put your thing in and I think I did uh 250 or 300 per month per person so it was like three different I thought that was Club LTV which was like the greatest name ever separate that was separate first was CEO Mastermind I think I still have the website CEO it just says index I think yeah maybe I didn't renew or something like that but um uh yeah something like that basically I had created this website this is how I met Ben by the way Ben was the one of the six people that signed up for this in the first batch I said oh I'm only having one group and I made this thing on click funnels and um they joined the group and I was the facilitator uh which was a you know bad move a bad move because why did I quit because I was like I don't really want to be facilitating this anymore so I'm not gonna do this business and the obvious it's the same mistake I actually made in my sushi restaurant which was the restaurant was actually quite profitable from month one but I hated going every day at five in the morning to the fish market picking up tuna and then making the spicy tuna makes the hated all the stuff and any smart person would have just been like you need to hire somebody to do that and um in my head it was just like if we hate doing this everyone's gonna hate doing this this is terrible I don't want to do this anymore I'll get me out of here and similarly for the CEO Mastermind I think I was the facilitator which was a bad move because really what ended up happening was I couldn't resist solving everyone's problems and everybody who joined was a fan of the Pod so they really just want to talk to me they didn't really care about their peers and so uh that was a mistake on my part but I'll tell you something Ben came out of that so I got my win out of that which was I met Ben he became my business partner the second thing was it is a great lesson in turning the intensity knob up it's like for anyone out there who's like oh I had that idea no no I literally had this idea I was in the same position as Sam had this idea before Sam created the website created the Prototype did the first round of it for a few months and then decided I don't really care about this six grand a month right now I don't really wanna I don't know if I want to grow this I don't know how I don't know how and I just sort of let it die on the vine fast forward three years Sam tells me he sends me that Google doc if I want to start this business I'm like oh that sounds super familiar I know that idea that's that's interesting I actually you know what I always did think that was a good idea but and so and then I got to see I got to watch it's like watching your buddy date your ex it's like I got to watch Sam send me a chart every day of the AR going up like just exploding like oh dude we're gonna need bigger paper eight by elevens not cutting it the bar charts going off the page and I was like this is a great example of when you turn the intensity knob up to 12. because you were willing to do the sales calls every single day every day every 30 minutes all day uh you were immediately going out and hiring people so that this could scale you wouldn't have to get bogged down in the operations you could stay focused on growing it you did all the things that anybody would anybody smart would advise somebody to do you were doing all those things and it was great to see and I say this not to say uh that you that you winklevossed me or anything like that that's not what that's my takeaway but I say it as a joke because I really that is my takeaway which is the difference between success and failure is often just turning the intensity knob up now at that time I just sold my company I was still working at twitch I I don't think I really would have gone and done that I don't think I really even wanted to do that but man is it a powerful way to see like a an A B test here's somebody who does it as a one of the 10 things that they're doing in a light intensity and it's really fully committed and versus somebody who's fully committed who turns the intensity knob up to 12. same idea using the same uh you know fundamental platform of this podcast as like you know your your launch pad for that where I don't know maybe not the launch pad because you need to promote it on here but you know the credibility you had when you hit up those people like a lot of those people you mentioned were from dude I think this uh this business would not be good for you in fact I don't think this business is good for me to run so I've hired I we got it to a certain size and then once we could we hired a CEO and that's within less than a year right which is yeah unusual but I think probably that you had a reason you wanted to do that or you actually probably planned to do that from the beginning why is that uh no I we didn't plan to do we we or we didn't plan to hire this person uh we hired Jordan but did you did you think you would be the CEO or did you know once it once it started working I was like oh man this is going to be significantly bigger than I think it can be and also I don't have the skill set it's a very operational heavy thing and you have to be very calm and patient and talk to people like really politely constantly and it's a very people-heavy business so you know we have dozens of these facilitators and like wrangling them up and like figuring all that out figuring all that out it's quite hard and I don't have that ability and I don't have the ability to run a really big company which I think this is going to be so no we I don't think you could have done this I I know for a fact I could have done this or could not have done this and you would have had to hire someone as well hiring a CEO this early is hard it's hard to hand over your baby so I think people I know when Andrew comes on people always ask oh ask them about hiring a CEO I don't know why I think it's another one of these easy buttons people want to push of like again it's like the mentor thing oh this person will solve all my problems oh if only I found a great operator then I could have all of the ownership and none of the work this sounds fantastic and of course that does happen it's not that it doesn't happen but I think a disproportionate where people are interested in that uh do you have anything interesting you could say about finding and hiring to see on how you know that they're the right person for for this business and taking that big leap of faith of handing a working but early business to somebody else so when I write like three months before I was selling the hustle uh about like literally three weeks before I started uh selling it before I got the email from HubSpot I started talking to this guy named Jordan who is the chief growth officer at uh Motley Fool which is you know like at the time like a 500 million dollar a year thing and I was like Jordan I want to hire a CEO for the hustle uh and I started recruiting him went to his house whined and dined him and he was like I'm in and then I got this call from HubSpot and I signed an NDA and they're publicly traded so I couldn't tell him and then about a week before the deal closed I was like Jordan I've gotta back out of our deal you like I I have to take this offer and he was like I understand but you know I told them HubSpot still needs someone to run the organization within do you want it and so he said yeah and so he ran it and so now I think HubSpot media which is what the hustle's called it has like 100 people and he's done a good job then a year and a half later two years later he quit and uh and he was like Hey do you wanna I heard you're working on this new thing can I consult with you and I was like yeah yeah that'd be great and I was like talking to him and he was like do you need a CEO and immediately I said yeah but I had this weird conflict with HubSpot and so I just hollered at HubSpot and I explained the situation I go man he bailed already he wants to work with me are you guys okay with it and so they said yes and so we immediately got in a room and we just hashed out a deal where he's highly incentivized to grow the company and he uh uh was is perfect for this because I I think I've known like what he's about but it was like a I guess technically a two and a half year process and the takeaway from this is I've I've been recruiting this guy for two and a half years now to like come and work with me and so it took a long ass time and so when we started the comedy honestly that sounds sounds like oh that's unusual no it's not unusual often the best people are people that you kind of have this like almost oh maybe the timing's not right yet and uh and eventually in a weird way things do fall together later much later but those relationships get built over time and they see you get to see them operate over time they get to see you operate over time and it builds a lot of trust so it's pretty common I think it's a good a reminder not to burn Bridges and not to close doors well that's what I was gonna say you have to keep people you got to treat people right so when we sold the hustle I gave him like a thank you check like you didn't work here but I feel really bad I just want to give you this as a token of my appreciation he's like and like it literally a check that just says thank you Sam when I say big check I mean it was physically a large check that I handed over to him and I shook his hand in front of it and uh but dude you gotta treat people right like you know uh Steph's miss another person who I've worked with for years she went and worked at Andresen Horowitz and when I was starting this I was like just so you know this thing's available but anyway this is a long game and you know you talked to James Currier James currier's partner is someone who he met James carriers is like I don't know close to billionaire guy who has a incubator and a bunch of other companies he is partners with someone I believe who he's known for like 20 or 30 years but you have to like it's a really long game to recruit these people yeah and by the way Stan who's his partner uh they've been they did businesses together for like 15 20 years stands currently not at nfx which is where where James is the thing that they I think I think they co-founded together maybe they didn't co-founders together but they were you know they've been doing business together for 20 years naturally he would have been doing that but he got recruited by Mark Zuckerberg and Zuck had been recruiting him for 10 plus years and finally got Stan to agree to go to Facebook uh after 10 years of Recruitment and um and I think now he's left but but he worked there for you know three four years during during that period and uh and I think James was like yeah that's cool like go ahead go for it go on tour have that experience that's great uh like you know our partnership is still intact even if you go do that which I think is a a pretty awesome thing you know I Had A and A Moment Like because recently where I I so I'm starting a new thing I'm not talking about it yet either uh so I'll come out uh let's talk about that in a minute about why neither of us talk about stuff exactly so I uh the plan was me and Ben are gonna do this great we've we just built and sold the bill crowd um that was a big win in a short amount of time we raised our fun together in like one month raised up raised our own rolling fund that can deploy I don't know between seven to ten million dollars per year we built a course business that's a seven figure course business we you know we've done like four or five things together now made Ben and I'm like oh we have our team we don't need anything else but as we've talked about this new thing I was like you know there's one person that I would recruit to join this uh that I would give equity in this to because I probably wouldn't give Equity to anybody in this uh because I'm like I'm sure this is going to work I think this is going to be big so I value the equity so why would I give money to anybody I don't need anything from anybody I don't need Capital don't need experience I need to donate anything there was one person and so I hit up this one person and I said listen I'm doing this thing I think you're a perfect fit for it and for that person honestly this is a perfect fit it wasn't even like a sales pitch where I'm trying to convince you it's like literally it was a perfect match like you know the thing you really love to do that's all we do um you know that real that problem with your current thing where you don't own any path to wealth I'm offering you a path to wealth you know you'll own equity in this thing um you know you always want to feel special literally I'm not recruiting anybody else this is either your job or there's no job um and I was like you don't have to interview this is I know you you've known me this was something that can work and the person was like wow this really does sound perfect but you know I'm hesitant because of this one visa thing this logistical thing and I was like and this person called me a few weeks after they they spoke to you and I was like oh well all those things are solvable and so uh anyways long story short the person was like you know what I'm just too nervous about that I don't want to you know I I I'm not certain I'm not sure I'm ready to leave blah blah blah and in my head my reply was like idiot you're an idiot thanks for notifying me about your dumb decision yeah it's like it's like it's like what a cute girl like uh you know like rejects you it's like well I don't even want you anyway right right you have ugly ankles and so that's how I felt I was like wow yeah I can't believe this person didn't take this offer um and so anyways I like have this like 30 second reaction where I'm like oh my God I can't believe this person didn't make the offer doesn't make any sense to me and then I was like you know what life's complicated I'm sure they have a bunch of stuff going on um like you know it's not as easy as a decision these are Big leaps of faith that somebody would have to take and you know what I thought they were great before this I still think they're great I think that you know this decision I think um is probably the wrong decision for them but who knows that you know the life is long uh I bet you I bet we'll end up working together in the future anyways because they're they are awesome and I think we're gonna keep doing awesome things eventually those things will intersect and um and so I was like okay that was my like reaction it brought brought up two things for me one is a reminder to myself don't let the the in the moment reaction be the response right so it's like um don't let the rejection or the feeling of oh it didn't work out like for example for Jordan in this case he could have when you when you rug pulled him on the job offer been like F this guy and uh when we sold the milk Road same thing we rejected the people who we eventually sold to First at the last minute and then they didn't get pissed instead they just followed up like you know 45 days later or whatever and we're like hey what's up I didn't hear any news did you guys not end up selling like we're still open if you would like to and we went back and ended up doing a deal and so I've learned over time that the real the real ballers they don't react they respond and so don't let the in the moment reaction take away your future opportunities that's the first thing um the second thing is it highlighted to me that courage is actually it's massively underrated and I was like this is I was like this person is more talented than me and in fact often when I work with people I'm like this person is much smarter and more talented than me why do I get the job why do I get the CEO job or why do I have the most Equity It's like because I think I just have one thing that a lot of these people don't have which is I have a lot more courage and guts to go for things that I want um that more talented people end up over analyzing and not going for and it just highlighted to me the importance of having courage and having guts to chase after something that's good even though there's some unknowns or some risks involved in it and not talking about this person's specific situation but just as a common trait of like what's the difference between an entrepreneur and um and a non-entrepreneur it's not intelligence it's not um Charisma it's not any of those things it's often Simply Having the guts to go and choose to go do the thing and so um it just highlighted that for me I'm like man this is a person with double the talent I have but they're gonna get half as far because they're lacking that one thing I hope they over time develop more of that confidence to go for it um and wow it made me act go reprice how important that is uh as an attribute I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out-of-sync spreadsheets serve dueling databases HubSpot grow better so I used to do this thing called hustlecon which was like you know we did it five or six or seven times and we would get founders of interesting startups to come and explain their story we would have 500 up to 2500 people there you spoke at a couple of them and I used to tell these people all right you're speaking slots at three you have to come at noon for the mic check and we'll be backstage and whatever and little did they know there was no mic check the mics worked perfectly there is no mic check like you don't do a mic check so the mic check could take one second and so you're getting them there three hours early was a tactic yeah the the mic check there there ain't a mic check we're just gonna put this little lapel mic on you're good um but I would tell them that because I was like sick I get I'm gonna get to spend time with all these like billionaire type people backstage and the best part was I would get like six of them backstage at a time and there was like a time where it was like this woman who started class passed it was the guy who started grammarly the founders of away you know the travel company the Casper Founders the founder of wework and I remember having them all back there and I would do what I do which is I would just like throw a question out there I wouldn't insert my opinion but throw out a question out there and I would hear them talk and people were complaining about like there's this one person who's like I have to fire my VP of Finance they're horrible you know they've been working me working with me for two years and I've known they've been horrible but I'm too afraid to fire them because I don't want the confrontation and there's another person saying like dude I've been raising money this whole time I got to keep raising and I don't know if I'm ever gonna make anything from this yada yada yada and then there was a couple people like Max of grammarly who uh is just like killing it but I get to like hear what he has to say and I remember thinking at that moment I remember thinking a lot of these people are 20 or 50 times more successful than I am but they are not 20 or 50 times smarter than me I I think that might be the case with a couple of them like the grammarly guy Max but most of the people they're like they're not you know we had the uh Tom from um Quest Nutrition who sold this company for a billion dollars I remember hearing him say like whatever he was saying I was like I have those same thoughts the only difference is is that you are more courageous than me and you started your journey a little bit earlier and you're getting after it and I remember that like being around that group and then being around our group that we had it did a few things one it normalized success and like another example of this is like sports like I don't think that Brazil is necessarily or Argentina has genetically Superior people that make them good at soccer it's just that they just grow up playing and they expect to be good and they work together and it normalizes that type of Excellence another thing is um um it made me realize that the people who I admire they're fearful they are exactly like I am you know I heard this guy complain about not wanting to fire someone because he just hated the confrontation the difference is that they do it anyway and so meeting my heroes that way it really uh made me realize that they shouldn't be on a pedestal other than the reason of like they're just they just did the damn thing not they're not necessarily smarter and so you and I have had people on this pod who are significantly more successful than both of us and a lot of them not all of them they're not much better or sometimes they're even worse sometimes we've had some amazing guests on I'm like oh it's kind of an idiot uh like there's been times where I'm like but they've killed it they've pulled it off Andrew Wilkins is another guy who I've talked about I'm like I feel like we're almost in the same ballpark of like patience of of IQ of like you know maybe one person's better or worse but his success level is huge because he's just been doing it for longer and he actually like tried something that was against the grain so anyway that's one of like the big expectati or the big things that I learned being part of Hampton and also being part of our group and that's one of the reasons why we wanted to launch it was to like make like normalize this type of success so if you're in Idaho so we have this woman named Janessa who has a company called simply eloped you'll have uh all they do is they sell like wedding packages basically it's a little bit more complicated than that but simply a lot you can check it out she's in Idaho has like a 10 million dollar a year business eight million dollar a year business and she's like in my neck of the woods like no one's doing what I do so I think that like I'm at the peak right now and so it's nice to be around other people who are killing it a little bit harder than me and now I know have like I know what the next level is in the next Peak but uh yeah that's one of the big learnings I have being around some of these successful people and we can move on and talk about other stuff but I'm pumped this is out another thing that we're doing by the way we're doing my partner wanted to try PR and TBD if it's gonna work or not but it's miserable dude talking to these journalists it's horrible I hate it I told my girl I'm never doing this again man being around these people you never know like what they're gonna take out of context or like if they're gonna come like Angry it sucks man I hate doing PR I've never done it and I'm never gonna do it again doing PR I feel like is like you know those scenes where it's like you take out a knife and they have a knife and it's like we're sort of approaching each other's knife we're gonna have to get really close if we're gonna either of us wants to do this I hope you're not trying to do that I have to have my knife in case you do that's how it's a Mexican standoff baby it's an old in fact we should we should drop the hard J of journalists and just call them hurdles because you know this next in the standoff is tough it's tough to do but I think there's I think there's a lot of value especially for something like what you're doing because you're gonna have the seed community of people who are like founder type people who probably listen to the Pod they know you or they know about the hustle and they trust you to build something awesome then you're just gonna have a bunch of people who've got good businesses that are like I don't listen to podcasts and I don't know what the hustle is yeah you know no I I don't do that but I do read The Wall Street Journal and if the Wall Street Journal tells me about this thing or if uh whatever TechCrunch tells me about this thing in my mind it's like credible and uh and so I think or you know you you reach out to somebody to join they're gonna google you what are they going to find when they Google you I think is a is an important like question for people to answer when you had done this you did a really good rant a second ago and there was like three or four things I thought were awesome and that what you said um one of them reminded me of something I watched last night so I was watching I was going down YouTube rabbit hole and I was listening to I watched this video that was compilation of Martin shkreli's greatest advice uh the whole like you know like Securities from the law you know besides that besides that you know there's 99 good things to say I am buying a lot of shkreli stock because everybody abandoned he became a penny stock everybody's abandoned everybody just sort of wrote this guy off and um I'm not saying that I would give this guy my money but this is a very smart person who has very interesting things to say he is very entertaining first of all um and secondly he's got interesting things to say and he's he's very very intelligent um did he do uh something wrong did he commit a crime it sounds like it I don't know I didn't go look at to all of it but he went to jail uh would I you know trust him with everything in my life would I give him you know the password to my bank account hell no but I do think that in general people just write off people way too quickly uh what did he say and there's a whole bunch of interesting things so in this compilation it's like a 30 minute compilation and halfway through he goes he does this one thing somebody's like oh yeah you know something about being successful and Martin's like he's like you know please first of all you don't have to want to be successful right like you you get to choose what you want what's success for you uh I play this capitalist game I like success success in this way and it's what matters to me and he's like so so if you want to do that he's like you know IQ nah like IQ is not the thing he's like there's like a minimum amount of IQ you probably need it's not as high as you think if you're watching this video you probably got it and he's like uh also bad news your IQ is not gonna change so worrying about IQ isn't going to help you um he's a pretty IQ he's I think he's a high IQ he's a high IQ kind of a guy but he's he's like I've met a lot of people and he goes actually the higher the IQ tends to run into one problem which is they just overthink everything they over complicate everything and he's like he basically described my favorite my meme of the year the midwit meme which is basically like you know the idiot the the sort of numb skull on one side and the Jedi on the other and then the middle is the uh the sort of the midwit which is the the person who's got the high IQ but the lack of Courage and the the lack of wisdom to know how to zoom out um and they over analyze and over assess everything he was basically describing how this happens for most people and I thought um man it's so true what he's saying that like after the higher IQ he's like he goes they just get in their own way and I got to tell you that hit different when he said that I was like it's so true I know the times in my life where I get in my I get in my own way and like what's an example oh tons like um uh like I I'll give you an example because I have somebody who's like a mentor of mine that I text all the time about my business stuff and usually just the act of typing it to this person I'm like I know what they're gonna say because they're they're on the Jedi side of things where they're like like I was talking to them about um I've given this example before my Ecom Biz where I was like I was like okay we got the Facebook ads up and running um it's working um you know I'm thinking we should do influencers I think influence could be huge for us and I'm thinking um we don't have Google but people are you know obviously there's a lot of search traffic look I I attached this PDF of report of search traffic and what do you think about SEO I feel like SEO could be good because it's cheap and then what do you think about and I was just like saying all this and then my Jedi friend was like um don't talk about don't say the word influencers until you're making 400 000 a month on uh on Facebook ads and I was like oh okay he's like because remember like we said at the beginning Facebook's probably gonna be the biggest driver so if you can't get Facebook ads to work none of this other stuff's probably gonna work and the best way to get Facebook ads to work would be too I was like focus on it yes and so just having somebody who could just Jedi zoom out and be like don't say don't say all these words like don't say the word influencer until you get to this amount of money then you're allowed to talk to him about influencer Peter tool has the same thing he used to do at running PayPal famously it's like was Peter teal a good manager and people like no like managerial skills or like soft skills are not what Peter Thiel is known for but he did one really effective tactic which was everybody in the company would have their one key thing that they're working on their One mission that they have and if you ever tried to talk to him about not your mission he would simply get up and leave the room he would be like oh you're talking to me about not the mission bye what did you say like Wilkinson is this a balloon floating away it's a very hot air ballist turns on the Fire floats away bye to us back in the distance and uh I've taken that like philosophy I'm not as hardcore about it as I want to be but like that's how I feel when I talk to people my company I'm like oh remember that thing we wrote down that we said was the most important critical thing the main thing oh you're not keeping the main thing the main thing big problem all right great and um and you see this all the time like the example I gave of the smart person who turned down the job that was perfect for them um they needed the Jedi to be like you want all these things and you just got offered all those things like take it figure out the rest after that um you know you know that's that's the Jedi zoom out and so similarly I think that being in these types of groups helps you with the Jedi zoom out because you will you will get out of your own way about some part of your your brain that's Tangled Up in a knot where you are overthinking over analyzing over complicating something it'll happen with like you know yeah I heard this guide it's just not working out but I feel like maybe I haven't put in the right position and then the peer group will be like so you're saying that they're lazy they misrepresented what they did before and you've tried to give them the freedom to do something and they're just not doing you know sounds like it's not working out maybe you should let them go and then yeah you get obvious well I'm just thinking I'm gonna do this they're like do you think that in the six months it's gonna improve no I just there's no way so then do you think you should do this plan right it's like it's the just obvious it's the common sense but common sense is fairly uncommon and this is the first time I've launched something significant with an audience and I remember talking to you with the milk Road I think you launched it January a year ago yeah end of December January yeah first edition came out and you like were so excited and with this pod we don't hold back and so you're just like telling me how excited you were but it was live and then it was working and everything but I remember you like forwarding emails or just talking to me you're like well here's the milk Road for Brazil it's live already they're just like they send it 10 minutes later but they just copy and paste it and I actually met one of these guys the other day he was like yeah I was one of the guys copying milk Road and he said like he said the most beautiful thing ever at least to our ears he was like but then I only did it for like a month or two months and I realized it was too hard and I can't I can't actually pull it off and I was like awesome that's exactly what we like to hear but I remember you like I remember you uh were like yeah this sucks like all these people ripping us off and it I don't think it made any impact on the actual business but it does like distract you and it gets your like cortisol levels going and it was the same thing with us with this audience and so there was a few times where I would throw like little Easter eggs out there like I would throw like a domain name like one time I just mentioned Marathon Ranch which was like the URL of my Airbnb and I didn't expect anyone to actually book it or I would mention like these other things that I had access to and I'd go and look at the analytics and I would see like oh wow 10 or 20 000 people came to the website um I'm gonna not mention this because I've learned from Sean's stuff of like let's not mention something until it gets to a certain size and there's a bunch of other reasons which is like you don't want the community to get too big too fast and all that but just the pressure of like people talk about like they build in public a lot of people who build in public they do it as a marketing scheme they do it to get traffic or to get awareness you know buffer did this buffer was one of the first peoples I've ever seen where they revealed all their revenue and they also revealed all their salaries and that was like their shtick like that's how we know about them other than their products great and everything but that's how they got out there but once you and I were in the very fortunate position of having an audience the name of the game for all uh for us a lot of times is just shut the hell up don't talk about and I remember like being in like seeing what you're going through and I'm like I'm not mentioning a thing anymore about certain stuff well I think uh I think you're right but you're focusing a lot on the like competitive aspect of it which I think is overblown and doesn't that's overblown yeah I think I think it's overblown I think it's the pressure and the lack of flexibility which is in the early days of something you you don't have a lot going for you right it's like um it's like do I have a big brand name no do I have a good track record of success and a bunch of customers no do I have a well-established product no I just built it last week right so it's like you don't have where are the attributes you don't have any of those attributes but the one attribute you have is basically like Speed and Agility the ability to to change be flexible adapt and um and and and and turn on a dime uh as you see oh the market actually wants this and so the reason for me to not talk about something early on is um typically that Vault two things one is with the podcast you're inviting a bunch of guests over to the house that's I want to clean up the house a little bit right because they're I'm going to get a lot of traffic from day one whereas before I had an audience I wasn't going to get a lot of traffic from day one cool I'll shout it out only 10 people are going to come to the site anyways doesn't matter how crappy it looks with something like this a bunch of people come so you you kind of don't want to put your your worst foot forward there but the most important thing is you don't want to go tell the world I'm doing X it's gonna be the best thing ever and here's exactly how it works because you lose a little bit of that flexibility and adaptability that's really your only attribute when you're when you're young right so it's like a kid or a baby like they're hyper flexible and they can fall down like a kid can't sprain an ankle because they're they're everything is just too like malleable right they can learn seven languages because their brain is like so malleable a startup is kind of the same way when it's when it's young which is that the only Advantage it has is that it's really valuable so don't Harden that too quickly by going and publicly announcing it when you may not have you know tested it enough to understand and exactly what you want it to be and how you want it to work that's my my take at least and let me give you let me give the audience two business ideas that I've discovered while working on Hampton the first have you heard of Haro it stands for help a reporter out Haro h-a-r-o so Haro was launched I think in like 2005. it was pretty early and if you're a new startup or even just like a smallish startup and you want backlinks it's based in so you're a user you sign up and you're a PR or you're you're a startup person and you're or you're a PR person and you get an email once a day sometimes like three times a day and on the other side it's a journalist so someone at Bloomberg says I'm writing an article about the surge of uh interest in homemade bread uh I need I have a deadline tomorrow so I need to get on the phone immediately and so the recipient will receive an email of like 10 of these types of requests and they reply and they go oh yeah I actually am a bread maker or I'm a bakery and we just switched entirely to selling home kits right uh get me on the phone and they do that because they want the link or they want the little bit of press that company was acquired by what's it called decision uh and it's kind of like just kind of floating around it doesn't seem like it's being innovated or anything like that but I'm pretty sure they have like one and a half million subscribers and people pay money to access it I think that someone can redo Haro because we've had like reporters come to us and be like hey can you introduce me to like a Founder who's doing this this and this I have a story I'm like yeah sure I we have hundreds of them um I think someone can build that out in a little bit better more interesting way and could have a pretty nice size company really quickly so Haro but redo it another one I still in our community the number one most common thing that people talk about is does anyone know of a good blank that can do blank so does anyone know like Has anyone used triple whale or a competitor what do you think has anyone does anyone know of a good lawyer right does anyone know of a good freelancer who could do blank I think you can look at just all the categories and I would create Niche websites for each or Niche newsletters so um uh long form copywriters here's the 50 people that we've vetted and we like you can pay access to view the list or here's a bunch of graphic designers who turn around quicker than normal they're cheap and they're reliable this is this list or lawyers or payroll software whatever and I think that you can build a pretty big business doing that because this is the most common problem that a lot of people are posting about in our community is vendors it's wild I'm shocked that it's consistently that I have a buddy who's doing something like this um Julian Shapiro and so I don't know if this is up right now but it's called uh while you're talking I I thought about making just like people are always like I need writers and I'm like I should just create Sam's list and it costs like 500 a month and I'll just update it with interesting people that were vetting right uh who are good writers and we approve of but I think I think you could do that so we might have to leave this out but um it's called the pineapple list so basically Julian was like all right he's in the growth world and he's been doing growth for a long time with demand curve and a bunch of things like that and so he's like basically I've interviewed thousands of Founders to figure out which agencies they use so which growth agencies design agencies contact agencies are good that we use and um and he's like so all you got to do is you come tell me what type of agency you need what your budget is and then we will just give you here's the top you know one or two or three um and we charge you no money for that recommendation we'll even you know kind of hop on a call and review some of these agencies for you and the agencies pay them for that lead this is a genius idea I think this is going to work really really well and um and yeah I I think this is a great idea and I think it solves an important problem which is uh you know in our founder group chats what question gets asked all the time hey anybody got a blank and blank that they love or hey anybody tried this I'm looking at it right now and then you get the like the real inside scoop I visit legit is it not is it is it just okay is it great Etc man I think these can be big and they're they're they're not uh they're they're hard but they're really simple and if you have three months of free time just go pick a niche and go interview all the vendors in the space as well as all the customers in the space as many as you can and get the truth about what they hate and what they love and create like a really vetted highly vetted list I think you could make a lot of money right doing something like this and it's a it's just a very Crystal Clear product Market fit type of type of solution right um yeah that's a good one all right do we want to do anything else should we wrap I think we should wrap thank you for putting my company describing it better than I even could I'm nervous man I've never been this nervous or at least I haven't been this nervous in like four or five years the business is already kicking butt you already have a great Community this business is going to work this is there's nothing to be nervous about at this point um also I think uh you know I hope we did a good job of basically not only explaining what it is uh but like hopefully some of the interesting things around it so that this isn't just like a one hour long sales pitch about Hampton but like you know some of the thought process that went into how did you launch it what did you do differently this time you know I hope there was some good nuggets in there you can let us know in the in Twitter if we went too far if it was good um and uh and the last thing I think is you know you've been working on this now for how many months since July so it's March nine months like that um you know that's a long time a long build up and so I think you deserve to have this episode to to kind of talk through the whole the Genesis of it how you went about it how it's going interesting stuff that's happened along the way you know uh that that is well well learned well deserved and I guarantee you I will predict and guarantee really that this is going to be a greater than 100 million dollar a year Revenue business which means it's going to be worth something like low end 300 400 million high-end billion dollars um I think I think that is the case extremely high probability in my head um well thank you that's awesome that makes me feel good um you know it's true I dude it Ebbs and flows and so I just want everyone to know that like I've built a six a successful-ish company before with the hustle you know we had tens of millions of Revenue and it exited and all that every single day I wake up and I'm both one I'm like this is gonna conquer the world and then the next hour I think this is impossible how are we gonna get this done so like I want everyone to know that the emotion still there that like it it doesn't go away you know it doesn't matter how fit you are running a race is painful it's a different type of pain but it is always painful and is and hopefully it's also rewarding but it doesn't matter if you're lifting 100 pounds or 500 pounds going to 99 Max 99 of your max is challenging yes good news bad news good news hey that feeling is normal bad news it doesn't go away when are we gonna when are we gonna when are you gonna launch your or announce your thing do you know uh I don't know a little bit of time a little bit time all right well thanks for listening if you're interested joinhampton.com I'll bring it up every once in a while on the Pod but uh yeah just check it out we're not gonna we're not selling it too hard or I'm not selling it too hard the point it's like a Harvard it's like Harvard baby so we want to our our our metric of success is how many people we turn down yeah exactly so go ahead and apply just so you can get that big fat rejection and then we get that acceptance rate under one percent yeah yeah we need a lot of people apply so we have more people to turn down I'm kidding thank you for checking out joinhampton.com thank you everyone that's it [Music]

foreign [Music] what's up y'all Sean here and this is going to be a different type of episode this is a I'm calling a master class so uh Master Class didn't invite me to do a master class because I'm not famous um but F them I'm gonna do it myself I know how to do some things really really well one of which is pitching and so if you're listening to this on the podcast feed uh it's gonna be slightly not ideal because I'm gonna share my screen I'm going to show I'm going to give away one of my little assets which is my dummy pitch deck so this is literally a template for how I do my pitch Decks that is uh for any business that's trying to raise money uh you want to send a deck to an investor and you want to have them understand what you're doing be excited about what you're doing and cut you the check this is a deck that I have used to raise money I have sent to other Founders or help them raise money I also in my power writing course this is one of the modules uh this is one of the examples one of the templates I give away so normally people pay a thousand dollars to take that course this is one of the little things in there I'm giving this away for free right now so if you're on the podcast feed you're not going to be able to see my screen so what I recommend you do hit pause open YouTube type in my first million that's find our Channel subscribe to it and uh and now you um you will be able to see the screen here because it's gonna be a lot better with the visuals but if you're on YouTube already all right you're here so here's um let's let me pull this up so this is my dummy pitch deck and uh by the way I'm doing this kind of live and improvise I haven't looked at this in a little while so there might be some uh some funky stuff going on but that's okay we'll we'll improvise as we go so the first thing is uh your title and a small subtitle explaining what you do and as we go through this pitch deck I'm going to um write in an example from that that I had done with a Founder uh in our power riding course okay so for example uh here with this is your title so they go we are shuni and I was like okay what the heck is that and they go um you know first they said we are an app for people with insomnia and I said okay that's kind of you know that's that's okay well it's a subtitle that says the outcome um and maybe your special sauce and so this is where we landed on so we go they said we are helping Millions millions of people fix their insomnia with skills parentheses not pills so that took a little bit of workshopping to get that one liner but when you have that one liner feels so good uh when you get that one liner so I think this is great what are we doing we are out here trying to help millions of people fix their insomnia with skills not pills all right so that's your first line first slide now let's get to the good stuff so this is where you want to you if you have credibility you want to lead with it which is basically in the beginning of any pitch an investor is trying to figure out should I even care should I listen and should I listen it's going to come down to one of two things number one um do you have something that I want so that's kind of what the title slide sort of hints at what do you what do you actually do and the second is um or are you somebody that uh is legit are you worth listening to do you have credibility or some some gravity to you about what you've done so if you have accomplishments I like putting that as slide two so a bit of credibility uh if you have some accomplishments set the stage this is your quick intro which sounds polite but it's actually a place to Humble brag and um if you or a company doesn't have accomplishments then skip this slide don't put this here you don't want to lead with I'm not that interesting so uh in suny's case I go why you know do you have any credibility and they go well our co-founder or our partner is this guy Matthew Walker who wrote This Book why we sleep it's a and I was like oh I've heard of that book it's like a bestseller they go yeah exactly so I go perfect so our title became we literally wrote the book on sleep um and then basically I explain um our co-founders or you know our Founders book why we sleep is a New York Time Best Seller with over x million copies sold or whatever the thing is um so that's like one of them and then you know the other person and I'm uh AI research scientist who has who was responsible for a 500 million dollar Plus is you know business unit at Accenture uh we built this app in five weeks and have uh over you know whatever XXX downloads with zero paid expect right so something like this you're trying to show that you're highly highly credible and then you know I would put the you know the the um like the title of the book you know the the recognizable image or some image here um in in big words and again forget the formatting right like I'm not working on slide design right now that's why I just took the times do Roman black font white slide because I'm not worried about design that will come at the end we'll do that later for now it's what is the story what is the storyline that's going to get somebody hooked so here we're saying uh we have a compelling initial thing we're helping millions of people fix insomnia with skills not pills secondly we're legit you should listen to us we literally wrote the book on sleep one of the best sellers we wrote that I'm a good business person an engineer that's the dynamic duo that's going to build this thing okay great so now you're going to say most customers have this problem and it's going to be backed by either really compelling data or a personal story um and so you know I'm gonna just copy paste kind of what I did for them here so most customers have this problem for that we did 25 of Americans have have insomnia that's 75 million people right and then we added to that the personal story so that became including me I had insomnia for years I tried pills but felt yucky I tried to send some oils that did nothing finally I found something that worked okay so this is your problem slide your problem slide with a big headline number that punches you in the face shows how big of a problem it is and ideally maybe a personal connection to it I had this problem I knew this problem I either I had this problem or I was a doctor and I saw thousands of patients who had this problem I've helped treat thousands of patients to have this problem right so something like that that connects you to the problem is ideal and then you want to do the current solution so before what what people are tempted to do is say here's my solution here's why we're so great um instead you want to say here's how they try to fix it today so what we did for this was we said so how we solve it today we did Americans spend 75 billion dollars per year on sleep aids to try to fix their sleep problems they barely work they have side effects and they're mostly using fake science right so that's what we put as the uh the secondary thing here um and then here I would maybe put some images of the categories right so I would put like uh you know whatever some shape here so let me get a little shape I'd be like uh you know pills or you know sleeping sleeping pills is x billion dollars um whatever you know nasal strips is this you know what whatever the whatever the other sleep aids you know essential oils or whatever people use to solve this problem so I would kind of show they try a b and c none of that works and this is where you now come in with the Steve Jobs moment you get your turtleneck on and you say but what if instead there was a simpler solution a beautiful solution a solution that totally fixed this problem with no downsides whatsoever all right this is essentially what you're gonna say and so um you know this is where for them we basically came in and we said um you know instead here's our solution you know instead we built an app that will uh teach you how to sleep without having to take medicine so that's the headline that would come here and then beautiful picture of your product um and then you kind of reinforce it right like that's us we do that thing um you know so if you if you gave a hypothetical here like what if there was an app that did Blakely blank then you say that's us we do that thing or in this case just put it all on one side that's fine now here's the key thing that most people miss so what they do typically is they go solution and then they just go solution solution solution they start talking about how the solution Works under the hood everything about the solution as an investor you don't need to know how the whole product works yet you instead need to know is this big am I going to make money right that's what the receiver of this presentation really wants to know am I betting on credible people are they solving a big problem does their solution make sense and how big can this get so now we go here we State the dream so we explain the big plan the big vision for how big this company could become you know this is where you might say we're we're building Uber for Freight Trucking right that's like we're building this big thing in this big industry um that's 100 billion dollar industry that's totally broken um you know so I so as an investor I'm thinking wow if they actually fix this problem that would be a big deal um so you know for these guys what they did was we said this our Dream what calm and headspace you know two billion dollar company one billion company did for meditation we are going to do for insomnia depression and anxiety and then you know we then added the sort of subtext these are 200 billion dollar annual markets it's 50 times bigger than meditation um and then we we follow on again we make this even more persuasive so you want to Anchor it to something that they already know and then you want to um so why did we use headspace and calm or why do we use it's Uber for x uh because it anchors into something they understand something that they know right we're building yeah I built an Esports app and I said we're building Little League baseball for Fortnight or for Esports okay Little League Baseball produces x hundred million dollars a year um we're going to be but but more people play fortnite than play baseball this is going to be a bigger business than even the little league is and so we were able to take something that sounded very Niche right like youth Esports but make it sound a lot bigger by pitching it connecting it to something that's already big and then saying we're doing that but in this big space so um so you know here's here's where this slide landed people with these illnesses are sick of taking pills for every problem we can get clinically verified results with habit-based app therapy um and I think the key here is what this thing you recognize did for the X we're doing for y y is much bigger than x 50 times bigger than x and people really have this problem all right so now you're going to get to your attraction slide again as an investor I'm trying to figure out is this actually going to work the easiest way to answer that question is to say it's already working look at this so so far so good and this is where you put an impressive chart um so your what is your hero chart how can you show that this thing is working so what is your what is your most hero metric and this is where pitching can't save you if your chart sucks your pitch is going to kind of suck um you know no pitch can fix a terrible business you shouldn't be pitching a terrible business you should be pitching a business that's working or going to work and so you want to if it's already working you wanna show that if it's going to work you want to say why you believe it's going to work maybe you have a wait list that's really big maybe um you have a track record of doing this with other products um you know what can you show that would give me faith that this isn't all just talk there's some evidence so this is where you put your hero chart now you go back to under the hood so now you're gonna say all right now you're interested correct I told you the problem the solution the big vision of how big this can be and the evidence that we're on our way so now what you're going to do is you're going to say let me tell you how we're different right uh does this already exist is this really that different than anything else and this is where you're going to highlight your differentiator what most people do is they just explain their features that's not what you want to do you want to say everybody does X and we do y right that's the core differentiator so let me tell you how our approach is different yet sensible others do X we do y and this is where you're talking about either your product strategy your business model your growth strategy Etc right everybody else charges for this stuff we give it to them at cost but we have a annual subscription that's Costco um it might be product you know everybody else tries to solve this problem with pills we do it with skills through this app that teaches you daily habits right um everybody else tries to grow through paid marketing but we do YouTube content that gets millions of views and therefore we're able to you know acquire customers for pennies where everybody else is paying ten dollars right this is the the type of thing that you're gonna do product business model or growth strategy how are you different than everybody else [Music] worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better [Music] now we zoom out is there a bigger Trend that you're a part of again this is all about instilling confidence confidence confidence confidence um are you know one way to instill confidence is we're not alone doing this this is something that you're seeing the whole world is moving remote um you know the you know the way that Peloton did this for Fitness we're doing this over here in this other space so you want to be able to zoom out and show that you're part of a bigger Trend so in their case I asked them this question I said what bigger Trends are you you guys a part of and they ended up telling me we didn't we didn't design the slide but there's three big trends one is app-based coaching calm headspace they've proven that people will do application the next one is telemedicine they're a billion dollar companies now that people are comfortable getting doctors and a doctor's advice over the phone and lastly is that insomnia depression anxiety are rising due to technology overload the pandemic the recession the whatever else and so we are we are surfing these big waves we're not the big wave ourself we are surfing the big waves now you want to answer the why now question so can you explain why this idea would work today but it wouldn't work three years ago or five years ago or ten years ago what has changed did a rule change did uh technology change did social behaviors change and so um you know for example in their case when we brainstormed and again it's not about slide design it's about being able to make a persuasive case and so each of these slides is part of your persuasive case this is your why now so why now well this wouldn't have worked five years ago regulation did not allow for digital therapy with licensed doctors so there's regulatory inflection point also in the last two years due to covet everybody had to have a telemed medicine experience we went from 10 of people having tried telemedicine to 80 in two years so the whole world got to sample this and now has an experience doing this there are to be more comfortable today than they would have been you know X years ago okay why are you the one to do it what's your track record your credibility your expertise you want to reinforce what we did up top or if you didn't write that up top you want to write it here so this is your why you um okay now the business part how do you make money doing this if I give you some money you know uh what will happen and so this is where um usually I actually kind of left one out here so what I would do here is I would separate these I would do how the money gets made this is where you do your unit economics so you show that you've actually thought this through that the business is sensible uh you know we put in X dollars it costs us why to produce the product or service and Z is the the net profit at the end at the end of it and so you know for these guys they were able to say we make a hundred dollars per session at 25 net margin here's our and then they had a graph of their unit economics and their payback period so they their payback period was um they acquired users for X dollars and that means they break even in three months on that user so so three books is a good good payback period so that's the unit economic side now you're gonna do the uh what Milestones will you hit so if I give you this money how will you make this the um uh how will you make this the the big um you know the big big results so you know here's yeah you know how will you make progress of that the valuation goes up and my shares become worth more uh so you know this is what we came up with for them which was the raisy 2 million to do their pilot to get our first 5 000 paying customers key drivers uh allow people uh in from the you know what are we gonna do to get there we're going to allow people in from the wait list we're gonna hire three more coaches and we're gonna roll out our company plan that lets corporations buy this for their employees so those are the key things we're going to do to get to 1 million ARR and now I'm telling you if you give me two million dollars I'll turn that into one million out of annual recurring Revenue um also on the uh Yu we had a good version of it for them uh so you know I'm a fan of being bold with the stuff so we're the team for this we're world renowned Sleep Experts and AI Engineers instead and then we wrote this instead of trying to get people to play eight hours of Candy Crush uh per day we've decided to help people help everyone get gets better sleep at night right so I kind of like this this vocal style of being a little bit ballsy not everybody loves that um and sure it could turn some people off but you want to attract the type of investor that uh likes you and so you know as long as you attract as long as some people love it it's okay that some people hate it you you know as long as it's just not everybody hates it um all right now this is one thing I see a lot of people miss out on sweeten the pot so you want to take some of your good news and move 15 of it to the end of the end of the show so what can you say for the end it's like your little good news dessert at the end of the at the end of the thing so um for them they're pot sweetener was this oops um they said one last thing we just secured a partnership with NIH they're going to be giving us 500 000 in this round no dilution there's over 2 billion in sleep funding grants available and we will tap into this as we grow nice uh just a little bit of good news at the end that shows more momentum more progress a key partnership you just had uh maybe it's a revenue Milestone or it's um you know some some key thing that's that you didn't put in your main traction you just took a little bit of good news out saved it for the end to leave them on a high note and this is at the end call to action so get in touch um you know well we're closing out this round if you're interested email me here uh here's my email address that's that's my dummy pitch deck uh I kind of messed up my template here I can uh I can make this available so if you just go to um I'll make a a link for this so just go to seanpuri.com slash uh deck d-e-c-k I'll put a link to this here so you can go and download this and have a copy of this for yourself and you can edit it with your stuff so I'll clean this up I'll revert all these so it goes back to the template and then um you can use this for your stuff so try this out let me know what you think um it's pretty battle tested so you know I've definitely been there the hard part for most of you is going to be you don't have good stuff to put on some of the slides you don't have a different chair or you don't have traction or you don't have a pot sweetener or you don't have a great track record and that's where you you're you will learn what part of your business is weak why would a smart investor not invest in this and you need to go fix those problems because it's if you do use this deck you will be able to raise money as long as you actually have good content to put inside if your business is not very good then don't worry about the deck make your business better first then go raise the money so anyways that's it that's my master class uh if you liked it let me know if you want me to do more of these I got I got tons of these things so uh go get this deck seanpuri.com deck and uh and try it out let me know let me know how it goes for you all right that's all [Music] thank you

it started off simple so he was like I need a building where they had like kind of a warehouse or production it's about one building okay outgrew that bought a second building and he's from this very small town Hamilton Missouri I think it is and um so you know she buys two buildings and then at some point they kind of realize all right why do this with like nameless faceless warehouses what if we could turn this into content or marketing like the YouTube channel is working so what if we do kind of YouTube behind the scenes and what if we make this more interesting so instead of just buying two warehouses and then just like you know operating in stealth what if we just bought all this land and we bought all the buildings that are in this area and we turned this into a tourist destination a vacation basically so like it's a themed town in the middle of nowhere but it's like the quilting Mecca or like people call it like the Disneyland for Quilters and there's like 12 like Main Street is all about quilts this is like quilt shop quilt shop [Music] all right what up we got uh Ben Levy here Sam is out today but uh my business partner Ben so we got producer Ben who's Ben Wilson and then we got business partner Ben Levy and uh Ben is here today we got a bunch of topics that we want to talk about but first welcome to the Pod yo what's up Sean how's it going man I'm good your your dad who's a regular listener is going to be pleased because he's going to hear you on here and I'm sure he he always sends you like uh like a huge text message of notes every time you come on or is that right yeah it's more like six emails he'll be like hey did you hear Sean say this thing or did you hear Sam say this or Sue we say this and I'm like love the notes dad so you were just in San Francisco um last week and we did a bunch of meetings we hung out worked a bunch and then we hosted a Meetup we hosted a private dinner um I wanted to start with that so I wanted to start with give me as many nuggets of interesting things that that came up people you met stories you heard products you heard about whatever you got from your trip to San Francisco I'll let you take it from take it away yeah so the first the first thing that comes to mind is when San Francisco's awesome uh but two went to the went to the Warriors game so we went to the Warriors game on last Monday with this guy named Al Doan who I think he's been on the Pod about nine months ago so for people that don't know Al is the founder of a quilt company and he said one thing Sean I'm sure you could talk more about Al but I think the one thing that he said that was pretty by the way by the way Ben just said quilt so uh because you said it in passing I think people wouldn't even it wouldn't even register what you just said it actually the way we met Al was pretty interesting Patrick Campbell came on the Pod and Patrick cable runs like a he had profit well which like does like sass uh payments or analytics and all that good [ __ ] so he has data on what companies are crushing it in terms of in terms of um their subscribers and their payments and he had said he had told us that quilting is a huge Niche and he came on the Pod he mentioned quilting and from that we found Al Doan who basically runs a multi-hundred million dollar quilting business that he co-founded with his mom so so that's the setup but uh continue yeah I think his mom and like his four brothers and sisters so it's a family it's a family affair uh so we hung out with him last time we hung out with him was Camp MFM and I think Al's an interesting dude one he's like six seven uh so he like Skies over you at every time I see him I think he could have played in the NBA uh but he said one thing that really you know one is business is doing great but two the thing that he said that really raised an eyebrow for me was he's in the Harvard Executive MBA program uh so most people when I when I hear the word NBA I think immediately that it's stupid uh I just think it's a waste of money and you should go build something instead of go get an MBA but he was like yeah I just hung out with the air of Crystal Geyser water so the place of the water you know basically every water bottle you ever see in the airport or convenience store and Sean and I were both like wait how do you know them and he what he said like I think he said the the woman is like you know basically it's an old French couple or something like that like he's like yeah I was hanging out with my friend my friend she's French she's she's older and blah blah and I was like how do you have this like old lady French friend where did that come from he's like oh I did this Harvard NBA thing and Al's like personality is not what you would connect with Harvard MBA first of all he does a quilting e-commerce business so that's you know like not like uh Fancy Pants you know Harvard thing second he's this big dude with a beard who lives in the Midwest and his he's like super funny he's basically like you know Will Ferrell slash Vince Vaughn and uh and so you just don't see him as a you know as a suit but he did this suit thing and we were like was wait is that a good idea should I be doing that that was my takeaway from it yeah I was like we should definitely be doing that and I looked it up I think it's like a fifty thousand dollar a year program they take like 30 people and everyone in there has a really successful business so definitely should be doing that I think he said it's all people whose business yeah I think like the minimum bars like your business does 10 million a year um so like you know that's like the minimum uh sort of like Norm he goes it's people from all around the world because International people like value Brands higher like if you've ever seen a Louis Vuitton store that's just full of Chinese people it's like International people really love American luxury Brands and Harvard is an American luxury brand and he's like you know it's I think he said it's three weeks a year for three years or something like that he's like but dude you make the best friends like you know the people who I you know not everybody but he's like I made a bunch of Amazing Friends through that and uh he's like dude I'm in the middle of nowhere Missouri so I gotta do things that will connect me with other people and then even this trip to SF we're like oh what are you in town for he's like well I live on a farm in the midwest so my wife is you know down for me to just like take three days a month and just go to wherever SF New York La just meet up with friends and hear what's going on in the world so I don't stay like totally disconnected in my bubble yeah so yeah I think that was awesome that he does that uh by the way you should tell the tell the Missouri Star uh because you you wrote this newsletter uh on our personal newsletter yesterday about owl and uh you should tell the tell the highlights of his story yeah no the thing that you didn't mention earlier about Al is the way that we met him is Patrick Campbell mentioned them and then I think I just dm'd him and I said hey do you hoot and no other contacts then that was it and I was like I've never met you but do you want to come hang out uh North Carolina that's a weird question why did you ask that did you know he was tall or how did you or did you just take a random shot like do you play basketball come to our basketball camp I think I looked on you I watched a YouTube video like I I heard of him I looked on YouTube watched like a minute video and I was like he looks tall seems like he has a good personality in this one minute clip I found on YouTube so hey let's just get to business do you play basketball and then he was like yeah I'll come and he was like I have no idea who you I could barely know who you guys are but sure I'll guess I'll fly there and see what dab yeah and he was amazing um but his his story is pretty cool so basically I think that the short version the thing he wrote in the newsletter yesterday if people go to dismiss my name.com so seanpuri.com you can sign up for the newsletter you'll get this it'll it'll send you the story after a couple emails so the story is his mom takes up quilting as a hobby and she's just having fun she's quilting and then she wants to do I guess like whatever is a more advanced quilt where you like you gotta like send your thing into a machine quilting company is that right like how does that work certain certain quilts you got to send in yeah I think there's like certain things that just need machinery and there was like I believe there was a six-month way to get some machine built quote machine built uh quilt made and he was like oh [ __ ] there's a business here how is it a six month wait and it was just like there's too much demand uh and so he's like Mom forget this quilt like you need to like and they bought the machine they're like let's create a Service Company where we do this because it sounds like there's too much demand so they bought the machine and then they make the website where they're like oh yeah send us your stuff and we'll do the machine you know quilting thing for you and uh and then people started asking them for fabrics and so they started selling Fabrics people started asking them for patterns they started selling patterns fast forward they've built this company it's called Missouri Star quilting company and again does you know nine figures a year in Revenue profitable bootstrapped family business co-founded with his mom uh they sell they have like 30 000 fabrics for sale now on the on the website and I was like dude what was the what was the Turning Point like did this work right away and what did he tell you he like he's like well I started he like posted on Facebook like hey guys made this quilt website for my mom check it out yeah like two likes yeah and I went back and looked at all of his Facebook posts yesterday and it's like I started a quilt company buddy and that was like his milestone in his life 15 years ago and they must have figured something out well it sounded like the thing that made it take off was he got his mom to start making YouTube content so he was like oh YouTube was like still pretty early at that time he's like um all right Mom record videos teaching people like how to be better at quilting and she they now have the number one quilting Channel almost a million subscribers and Jenny who's his mom is like beloved like the comments are just like Jenny is the best she's still wholesome oh my God I love her she's a she's a star so the YouTube thing took off and then he went and stole the idea from woot.com about having one crazy daily deal so something that's like 50 to 100 off but it's limited quantity limited time and they call it the quilter daily deal or something like that and that trained people to just keep coming back to the website to see like you know what amazing deal could they get for some new pattern and those two things were like pretty major um you know like growth hacks that they pulled off to to grow this thing and he might just be the most successful like daily deal site ever right like in terms of profitability yeah yeah I don't know how big Groupon is now but like you know it's it's what he did is bigger than woot so you know that that kind of worked and then the other thing he told us about was his town so explain this town and what he told us like he's thinking how he thinks about these Town things Yeah so basically uh when we we discovered Al we realized that he had a town it was written about an NPR uh a few other places and essentially what it is he had he needed a bunch of production done so he needed a manufacturing facility for all the clothes they were selling so they bought a town basically that which means they own a few restaurants I think they own a few gas stations and they own a few manufacturing facilities and they made it the quilting capital of the world so basically it's where people go and they want to learn and see learn and use quilts and they also so he's basically like really basically I think he's the pioneer of towns I think he talked about this in the Pod a while back but he's all into towns and he yesterday he was texting us even more ideas about towns well it started off so he's like I need a building where they had like kind of a warehouse or production it's about one building okay I'll grew that bought a second building and he's from this very small town Hamilton Missouri I think it is and um so you know she buys two buildings and then at some point they kind of realize all right why do this with like nameless faceless warehouses what if we could turn this into content or marketing like the YouTube channel is working so what if we do kind of YouTube behind the scenes and what if we make this more interesting so instead of just buying two warehouses and then just like you know operating in stealth what if we just bought all this land and we bought all the buildings that are in this area and we turned this into a tourist destination a vacation basically so like it's a themed town in the middle of nowhere but it's like the quilting Mecca or like people call it like the Disneyland for Quilters and there's like 12 like Main Street is all about quilts this is like quilt shop quilt shop which then and then they have like the Missouri Star one which is the biggest store so that's their retail flagship store they use this to create content to create interest people then like take a pilgrimage a trip to go visit here if that's their main hobby if that's their big hobby it's like oh here's the here's the vacation I want to go on and when they're there they also have a man what is called man's land it's basically like if you're the dude who got dragged to this quilting vacation they have one area called man's land which is like really comfy recliner chairs TVs food and it's just like yeah you hang out over here and watch football and let her you know let let Grandma go crazy at the the quilt shops and so uh creating that town I think is kind of amazing he said that they have a hundred thousand tourists come there every year which is which is you know still kind of relatively small but he's like yeah dude we just need like a developer to build a hotel like there's just no place to stay and he's like you know nobody knows about this area but I'm really he's really bullish on turning the the sort of the cost center into a marketing uh a marketing tool and I think that was really really smart and what I wanted to tell everyone about the time that you were thinking about yesterday well we asked him we were like dude that's I was like dude that's genius what else would you do he goes got it babyville USA I was like what and he's like uh so he's got four kids or he's about to have his fourth I think and uh and he's like yeah basically I think you could make a town for all things baby so let's say you're a pregnant mom or you just um you just delivered you're in your maybe you have a newborn a one-year-old a two-year-old so most you know traveling is hard first of all uh for either late pregnancy or or you know early kids um and nothing is optimized for them like even places like Disneyland and like places that are like kid friendly it's like ages three and up really is like what's what's like acceptable and useful and so he's like dude if we made this town where you could come and it's like some combination of like just a crazy Spa for Mom mom deserves it like she is her body's going through a lot she's not sleeping not all this stuff let's take care of her let's have the best sort of most baby friendly places whether it's restaurants uh retail whatever it is let's basically let you try any baby products so like there's like the the mass stroller store where it's like you're gonna get the best stroller we're gonna it's like you have the Consultants there you have a testing ground um you know this is where you're gonna find the best products and you get to test them you get to learn about them and it's like it's like an expo for all things baby so you're gonna sell a ton of product you're gonna uh provide a vacation or a rest you're gonna be the most baby proofed and Baby Friendly everything is gonna be optimized for that type of clientele and you can also do a bunch of fun things so he's like dude stroller races uh you know he's like you know we can he's like this would be such amazing like funny content uh that you could do around this whole thing baby so he's like baby Phil and uh and it's it's kind of true because like we just hired a guy and he's like oh yeah can I start after this date because I'm uh I bought my wife a push present and a push present for those don't knows like you know after you deliver you basically so here's a gift or a vacation um you know to celebrate you know putting yourself through one of the hardest things ever which is like you know labor and um and so I think baby moons are a thing push presents are a thing I think there's already a whole bunch of like the culture around this stuff uh and so if you made the Instagram worthy town for that I think that could be big I'm I'm really hoping he does this because uh I want this you know and I want the baby combine I feel like I'm so competitive and so many of my friends are like yeah I don't care about my my how I stack up to people my age but I care like you know what percentile is my son in height and weight and how fast is he and is he crawling I remember when when my son was like one we would just watch other kids on Instagram and decide who looks like they're in better shape yeah just compare yes I think that's a great idea and I still yeah a baby vocabulary contest baby crawling contest yeah like crazy horoscope thing where we we give you a scroll that tells you the future of your baby for for a hundred dollars I could think of a million things to sell in this town yeah I love that uh and like all right what else so we had Al we go to the game what else did you got uh another guy that I met up with was this guy Justin called back uh so for people that don't know Justin call back I think is one of the best angel investors of all time he led the Snapchat C deal uh Pinterest seed deal uh he does have kind of a checkered past uh so I think he was essentially canceled uh so he was at White Speed was basically canceled I don't know three to four years ago and now he's writing seat checks uh as a PR as a GP um so I basically met up with this guy uh had talked to him a bunch on Twitter and he said a few things about investing that I thought were particularly interesting and particularly that we're thinking about the first was a question which was like are you a good investor uh and what's your answer to that Sean like do you think you're a good investor I think I I think two things you can't know yet so I can't say with anything definitive because you only get measured I don't know seven years after you start investing so the honest answer is I don't actually know I do think I will do well with investing because I have a good Network I have good judgment when it comes to what startups have legs and what don't um and uh and like you know I'm aggressive so like you know I what I make what I lack in IQ I make up for in like uh guts and so um so I think those three will result in uh in a great outcome for me and then the other question that he kind of asked is like can you what did you say when he said that by the way that's a great question to ask somebody to be like are you even good at what you do um is it is a fantastic question what did you say did you uh did you did your butt clench in did you know what to say in that moment uh I said I don't think I'm great I think I could be great if I tried he said that's what everyone says um and I said yeah but I think I could uh and then he was like well okay answer me these questions then can you defend every deal that you've kind of pushed the table for without saying these two words grade founder uh he was basically like I hate when someone tells me they're investing because it's a great founder because that's the that's something that nobody can argue you on uh even if they know the person because they're just like I can argue you and work it I can argue you on product I can argue you on um you know 10 other things but I can't Darby you I'm great founder so can you defend every deal you've done recently without saying those two words uh what's your answer to that question uh can I defend every deal uh yes I can explain why we did every deal would I defend every deal no because I think we've made mistakes along the way and we did deals or deal sizes or add valuations that knowing what I know today I could say you know that that wasn't a good decision you know uh going back with the benefit of hindsight I would think about that differently now but I think that's natural like there's no way that you could get into anything as a uh you know start a new activity new job new hobby whatever it is and from day one be Flawless hell no right now could you but should you have a um a line of thinking on everything you did yeah here was my line of thinking was my line of thinking always correct no uh here's some errors I made and I can tell you specifically like three errors I made one I would say is the um oh but I love this business I hate the valuation but I love this business um I think that is a is a pretty common mistake and even though it sometimes works out like um you know we invested in a company that was valued at 200 million I invested because I had been trying to invest since the seed round but I haven't gotten in so I kind of had I was like you know anchored to this lower price and now it's a multi-billion dollar company so our investment's still up I don't know 40x so it's a great investment from a return point of view but honestly it was a pretty dumb investment like my only out uh was that this thing would this company would go from 200 million to a multi-billion dollar company even though at the 200 million I thought it was overvalued based on where the revenue was and I think even though I think I got lucky on that more so than that was the correct decision um and I think that's the case for like a bunch of things I did where the difference in your outcome when you invest at a eight million valuation versus 18 versus 50 versus 80. um is is just really really profound and the better move is to stay disciplined don't chase the higher valuations just pass even on a good deal because you just want to deploy all your dollars in at the lower valuation so that you can have when you hit you hit super super big um you know we did another investment that was at a five million valuation and now it's at I don't know 300 300 400 million and uh it maybe it may end up at the same multiple as the first deal I talked about but the second one was actually using Sound Logic and judgment and the first one was uh chasing uh you know something that I wanted and you know I only had one possible way to to get a good outcome out of that yeah I think that yeah I think I think that makes sense and I think he thinks similarly like I think you know the other thing that he said uh that I intuitively knew but never really thought about is how many deals he looks at a week yeah he's talking to a hundred to 150 Founders every single week which I think is just like to do maybe one deal a month at most so maybe he's doing one out of 600 things he talks to um and the thing that he said that I thought was interesting about that was uh you know you kind of notice what good and great is you know most there's a ton of people you meet that are in the good category in terms of Founders right it's like really smart people building interesting things great backgrounds but there's very very few people you meet that are great um so I think that was like a learning for me which is like really being disciplined to only do deals when you think they're great which I think applies to more than just Angel Investing kind of applies to everything it's like most of the time you know what crate is uh but you just get impatient and you go for good right and I think his his portfolio is pretty nuts by the way GrubHub snap Open Door Stitch fix whatnot imperfect Foods uh uh boom Aerospace you know these are these are some some pretty solid ones especially if we got in there yeah and I think you know I think obviously he was canceled there me too for a reason so like I don't I don't I can't say he's like the best dude personally but obviously he's a great investor yeah yeah you know it's hard to know what happened in certain situations and I don't know I try to for better for worse my thought when I meet people is when somebody tells me how great somebody is I don't assume that they're perfect and when somebody tells me how horrible somebody is I don't think that they're evil and terrible um I sort of take people at face value so I meet them I uh you know ask them about the situation I hear the story and then I see how they treat me and I observe how they treat other people around them and I kind of just use that as my filter rather than um getting caught up in this sort of stuff and I also have friends that I think are like you know um great in one area of their life and I can learn a lot from them in that area uh you know whether it's investing or business or Fitness or whatever and they're not so great in other areas of their life rather than sit there and judge them I just try to if I find somebody that's great I want air life I just focus on that and I try to learn from them on that and I move on you know I don't really get too caught up in the full picture yeah 100 and then in terms of you know other thing I I took away from San Francisco was there was one other thing that we did that I took a lot away from which was we had a small dinner with about 10 people uh I had no idea really what to expect like I I went in cold basically knowing none of these people uh so Sean you want to set the table for what that dinner was like yeah we hosted a dinner at F dot Inc uh which has a great office in um in Fort Mason and San Francisco uh we invited about 12 13 people something like that uh I would say some of them knew each other but most people didn't so it's one of these like Stanford very San Francisco things it's like one person curates the guest list and they're basically saying trust me these people are cool and then everybody else just goes on that uh that assumption and if you ever violate that it's like dude I went to this one dinner this guy hosted and people were not cool you're just like all right they're out but as long as you can successfully curate this you can sort of build a really cool community and brand around it so inviting some people uh the conversation was basically I think you know I saw your face at one point because in the most San Francisco thing possible the conversation quickly shifted to like drugs but like not like uh party drugs but like um you know people in Jefferson love this like you know sort of like oh I micro dose this thing or I do Ayahuasca or I do DMT or I do um mushrooms you know for productivity and like all this other stuff like I do this instead of therapy I do this in addition to therapy I do this in addition to or to help my productivity and it's like bro could you just drink coffee like why do we have to do all this are you sure that's like my feeling because I'm I'm like a a more Straight Arrow guy like I just I don't do I don't do any of the stuff but that was you know that was pretty heavy part of the conversation at the beginning and then there was you know it transitioned from there but what was your take on the uh the drug convo yeah I mean you know I've been someone that's always I haven't done anything but I'm not like incredibly opposed to it I you know my take was just seemed like that's what most people were focused on like uh every most the people in that room were really successful and the thing they were focused on was figuring out in some ways how to be happier uh like that's kind of what it boiled down to is like how do I be happier and how do I have better relationships with the people that matter uh and it's always odd to be in you know I always find it kind of uh odd to be in those rooms where everyone seemed like they have everything they possibly want right like I'm probably the least wealthy person in that room the least well-known person in that room and uh yeah so I find it interesting that people are resorting to that type of thing and maybe there's a lot of great to be had uh the other thing that I took away from it is everyone talked about this thing called touchy feely which is a thing that happened I think it's like a Stanford class where basically you boil a leadership class so if everyone's talking about how to be a better leader uh and how to really connect with people and the one thing I wrote down in my phone was I'm an [ __ ] so I remember like basically the their take was this is like really when all these things boil down to is recognizing that you're the [ __ ] at every situation uh then I remember afterwards I was like I don't know maybe I'm just an [ __ ] for to everyone for these 10 reasons I think the line was uh every great marriage comes down to one realization I am an [ __ ] and once you realize that and you accept that it humbles you but it also uh it's sort of like you understand the other person's side because damn they're dealing with this [ __ ] and I thought that was like a really I don't know if I believe that but I thought it was a great line um there was one part on the so the the drugs part I thought was interesting because it was like some of these things that are taboo today become very normal 10 years from now and Silicon Valley is usually at the front of that curve and you're right it was stunning I mean this is a very successful group of people there wasn't a person in that room who wasn't wealthy successful all that stuff and I would say what 40 of the people at that table had experimented with some version of a like I don't know what you would call the hallucinogenic type of drug in order to try to be happier uh you know happier less anxious or better in their relationships and um that's just a crazy ratio to me you know that's a that's a wild ratio that's a very San Francisco uh a ratio that you get and sometimes San Francisco is just off the reserve off the reservation and sometimes they're ahead of the curve and it's pretty hard to figure out which ones which you know these are the same people that in you know 20 2012 we're talking about Bitcoin and this is the same group of people that you know um whatever they're like you know experimenting with AI four or five years ago um you know so they are the the hard part is you can't write it off because often these are people that are that are right in a bunch of areas yeah the touchy feely thing I thought was cool because they said that one framework for communication uh I think that's probably worth worth saying which was uh so they're talking about how great this touchy-feely thing is and of course my natural question was like wait so like like what like what did you like what's an example you're saying how great this was and how it changed everything for you like what's an example and uh our friend siki uh siki Chen who now runs Runway gave this great uh framework he goes they teach you that there's what was it five layer five layers of communication and so let me see if I can remember this off top of my head so he's like the first one when you deal with people you're gonna be at one of these five layers so it's like uh the level one or layer one is ritual this is like you know you walked you walk into the office hi hey hi you know hey what's up what's up you know like just like it's automated it's not like it's just a ritualistic thing you're just a quick uh quick hello then there's number two which is extended ritual which is hey how's it going how's your day uh you know what's new these things that you you say it's an extended version of the ritual you don't really care or you're not really asking the question you're not really expecting anything nor are they really telling you what going on in their life it's sort of this uh like just this dance we do the third level is you're talking about some content but it's surface content so at the third level service content is you're talking about a project you're talking about um something you're working on or something you're doing uh something that's happening you're talking about the game you're talking about the the project whatever it is um and what he basically said was like you know most of our communication just happens at these three levels every day but the problem with it is um imagine in every interaction there's two tracks so on the on your left hand is the track of like the content of the conversation and on the right is the relationship between the two people and at these first three layers the content might be moving but the relationship is not moving uh relationship the relationship uh is not being invested in and so if you want to be somebody who's better at building relationships like you don't you need to get out of just these first three layers and get to number four four and five four is feelings about the content so how do you feel about what's going on right I feel stressed about this project I feel worried about this thing I feel so excited about uh this game tonight you know whatever it is and you're sharing a little bit about what's inside for you how you're feeling about the thing not just talking about the thing so that's that's better that moves It Forward because you're there's some vulnerability there and then the last one is feelings about each other which is dude you know I felt disappointed when I expected this was gonna happen but actually this happened or I felt uh annoyed or I felt frustrated that we keep ending up in the same Loop and being able to share that is obviously the the the saying how you feel about the other person and I said negative ones but it could also be the other way like you know I feel you know I love working with you I love uh all right you know I had so much fun I felt uh you know tons of Joy when we were doing XYZ so you could sharing how you actually feel about the other person is the hardest one but when you do it that's what moves that other track the furthest and uh and they talked about like the little nuances like instead of saying I feel like blank blank blank anytime you say like you took it away from how you actually feel it's just I feel blank or I felt blank um is the right way to do it so I thought that was pretty cool because that stuff it's hard to learn anywhere like school or whatever and it sounded like that you know you talked about the Harvard Business School thing that was one note and the other one was the Stanford touchy-feely thing as like oh that sounds pretty cool uh I should check that out or you know I want to get better at that this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better and you told a great story uh basically about your experience doing that same thing uh at the prison you already should tell that story yeah so all right so once uh once upon a time I uh I get an email from my boss and this is a guy uh Michael Burch so he was basically the main investor in our company and he's kind of like my mentor when I moved to Silicon Valley I moved here to work with Michael Michael uh Bert she built multiple successful internet companies that's what I wanted to do so I was like I want to learn from this guy and um I always I don't know if other people feel this way but whenever I'm around somebody who I really admire or I really like like I feel an intense pressure to um just like do good in that do good in that setting like I just always wanted to like put my best foot forward uh if it was a meeting I wanted to look smart if it was a socialist situation I wanted to be Mr Charisma and like be the be this they brought me to this event I want to have the best conversation and sometimes that's okay that's natural but often it felt forced and it's just a lot of stress so anyways he emails me this thing says hey come with me to this uh this I did this event and I want you to come to it you know don't ask too many questions just come he's like it's Friday at this time to show up and so I show up and what he signed me up for was uh this group called inside Circle I think it's called and basically they take a group of kind of like Silicon Valley CEO type people a group of men from from the business world and they bring them inside of Folsom Prison and they take you to meet inmates who are uh in prison for life so they have a life sentence and um so you go to this sort of like I don't know if it's maximum security or whatever but you go to this like intense prison and you're going to meet with people who are in prison for life if you're in there for life you did something that's you know Murder or you know sort of equivalence and and so I'm like oh [ __ ] and he's like yeah it's a two-day event it's like an overnight event I was like what the hell uh all right thanks Michael so I go to this thing we walk in and um I don't I still don't really know what to expect I'm like are we giving a talk is this like an entrepreneurship talk like what are we trying to do here so I'm prepared for like some presentation or something like that but instead we walk in uh the guys all get uncuffed we all walk in together and um we all sit in a circle and I'm like oh this is a feelings thing oh [ __ ] this is like you know this is like AAA or something I don't know what I got myself into but my brain is racing and when the guys were walking in uh you know I'm like just kind of like scoping everybody out and there's one guy who walked in that just stood out right away he was wearing sunglasses and he had a cane but he wasn't blind so I was like I don't know how this dude has this privilege to like be able to have a stick that he walks around with and sunglasses but this guy's got clout immediately you could tell and he was the only guy who was like not smiling not talking to anybody he had like two guys around him who like kind of escorted him to see brought him a clip of water and I was like oh [ __ ] this is the guy who like runs the prison got it I've seen movies about this [ __ ] I know how to like spot the alpha this guy's the alpha and so the event basically starts as follows they go break them into like smaller circles uh you know groups of six and um and you know this guy who's been here he's the facilitator he'll begin so break up into group of six of course I get paired in a group with this sticky the Tough Guy and um I'm like all right what do I have to do here how what do I do again what am I trying to trying to do to like you know do well in this situation and basically the group was sort of like the the activity was sort of like you just each person goes around you just say what's on your mind first guy gets up and he tells this super intense situation that he's in he's like uh right now I'm feeling um frustrated man I'm feeling pissed feeling angry I'm like oh [ __ ] he's like I'm feeling angry because uh my daughter who's on the outside told me that you know she had been sexually assaulted and I'm pissed that I'm not there to beat that guy's ass and then you know protect her and uh and so this guy tells us like really intense thing and then I'm like oh [ __ ] and then the next guy says an even more intense thing and third guy says this really traumatic he's working through this really traumatic experience by the third person I'm no longer listening I'm in my head and I'm I'm doing the math I'm like okay I'm three people away what am I gonna say and like I mean look at me I'm wearing a Mickey Mouse shirt right now I'm like you know my parents love me my life is pretty good I'm healthy I'm happy and all of a sudden I'm like God damn it parents why did you have to love me I don't have [ __ ] to say here like I I couldn't you have just had a drug problem and made this a little easier for me like what am I supposed to say that's not gonna stand out like a sore thumb like I can't be like the biggest problem in my life right now is we have this deadline for this thing we're trying to this new feature we're building by Friday and I I just don't know if we're gonna hit it guys like you know that shit's not gonna fly here so I'm like [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] I'm panicking and I'm not listening at this point it keeps going around the circle finally it gets to me and I'm like okay I just gotta tell this like this kind of like this the most traumatic thing that's happened in my life whatever I guess I'm gonna say it to these strangers and I'm gonna ham it up a little bit and really like you know just try to deliver this I essentially start performing and so I I tell this thing about some family thing that happened in my past and I'm like doing these dramatic pauses and I'm like you know not like pretending to cry but I'm definitely pretending to feel it a little more than I was actually feeling it in that moment I tell the story and I told it good I'm a good Storyteller and so I'm like I brought my a game because I was under pressure I told a great story and I'm like all right thanks you know thanks girl for listening and uh on to the next and then the hard guy goes man that's some [ __ ] and I was like oh no what what's happening and I go what and he goes man that's some [ __ ] man you're just saying that [ __ ] I go no that really happened because I don't care if that happened he goes you ain't really feeling that and so this guy basically instantly sniffed me out in a way that very few people can really tell you know when I'm bsing like that and now I'm feeling like am I gonna get beat up like what's gonna happen here this is a worst case scenario the hard guy is like just like went out of nowhere he didn't say this to anybody else in the group but for me he's like that's some [ __ ] man and he was like out he was like out on me and he goes he said something he goes like um he goes I go what do you want me to say he goes he goes I want you to say what's on your mind uh well yeah what you really feeling and I go I'm feeling nervous because why I go because um I want you to like me like the truth came out I was like I want you to like me which is it was the honest and I'm like oh my God what did I just say the lamest possible thing that one man can save another hey pause and he goes that's your truth and he like accepted it he goes that show truth man and he got up and he like got it he like came up to me whatever and we like whatever uh he's like you know I appreciate you for telling your truth that he hugged me and he sat back down and I was like what just happened he's laughing now this guy had it cracked a smile the whole time and he just thought it was so funny that obviously he scared me shitless which he did and uh he got me to break which he did but it also showed me like like you should just uh lead with the truth it's a lot easier than uh trying to perform but uh yeah that was my like touchy-feely uh touchy-feely like intense experience yeah that's basically what touchy feely is right it's just like trying to get to the core of what you're actually feeling or thinking right and sharing it yeah I mean I don't know I haven't done it but it does seem like it's about being a little more more honest more authentic and less of the surface level autopilot [ __ ] that like we get used to doing kind of in the real world um all right what else we got so that was your San Francisco trip any other big ones otherwise let's do a couple of cool ideas the last one from San Francisco is uh the other person that came to dinner was this guy named Kendall so he bought the milk Road uh with Mike uh some milk craters a crypto newsletter and then Sean and I started and sold and I think from I worked with them for three months pretty Hands-On every time I see him it makes me think of this which is you know instead of asking what would a g is this still I asked what would Mikey Kendall do uh and they do two things really well that I try to embody whenever I ask that question which is like one one Kendall himself is really good at spotting an opportunity so he's basically he's thinking and fishing all day to find what they should go attack and then Mike is really good at consistent intensity uh so what I mean by that is let's say you're trying to figure out Facebook ads every single day first 10 hours he'd be looking at it try to see what's working what's not and doubling down instead of being like Oh Facebook's working I'm gonna go work on Pinterest now I'm gonna go stand up a Twitter ad so I think when I saw Kendall it just reminded me like be more of Kendall and Mike uh in anything because that's a winning combination to be like great at spotting things and then once you spot something that you want like take in incredible intensity to get it done yeah so these guys each have basically you know candles builds and sold companies for something like just under 100 million dollars two companies uh my slash company I think sold for nearly 200 million dollars so obviously very successful but when we met them you know I always look for okay what what was it about this person what what contributed to their outsized outcome because usually the [ __ ] ain't an accident uh you know we always you got to have some attributes so it's like what are the attributes that this person had that led them to that some people it's they're amazing Engineers okay great they built some crazy [ __ ] some people it's like um they're amazing investors they are great at spotting opportunities um and and whatever for some people they're great um sales people you know oh this guy could sell ice to an Eskimo I can see how they were able to grow their business really fast uh so this person you know somebody's really high IQ they're just super super smart they you know they they built this thing that I could barely understand half the words about you know but they understand that industry they navigated it with Mike and Kendall I felt like with Kendall I was like you wouldn't want to compete with this guy because he's just gonna figure out the loophole in the game like he's gonna figure out the cheat code I think he's gonna figure out oh and Mario you run onto this block that you just hold down and then you fall behind the screen you run and then you get The Magic Flute that lets you skip nine levels and I feel like that's Kendall Kendall will find The Magic Flute that lets you skip levels whereas you're sitting there trying to beat every single level and he he was just like no that sounds painful I'm gonna find you know I I think I heard or you know there's got to be this like solution where I can get ahead faster what is that who's making the most money and then how do I do what they're doing so he's he's good at sniffing out that thing and Mike is like um Mike is smart but he's not like he's not like he's the smartest dude I've ever met but he is one of the most intense dudes I've ever met like uh we'll have a meeting and then we'll go out for drinks but somehow in between he ships like a a notion doc with all of the action items tagged and like referenced uh because he's like well obviously that was a good plan we should write it down and then do it and I'm like yeah well don't say it like it's common sense like you know oh we're gonna get a little distracted over here and we're gonna you know we'll stretch it out we'll procrastinate a little bit he's like well why would you procrastinate just do the whole thing right away it's like I don't know because I'm not you I'm not a machine and he's a machine and so I think it's really useful to just be around somebody like that and I think we had this Theory when we sold the milk road to them because we were considering different offers and it was like I don't know dude I think we're not pro like it's hard to put a price on we're gonna get to hang out with these guys who are going to make us better as entrepreneurs that's a factor and um and so yeah they I think we've noticed this in a bunch of people as we meet people me and Ben always call each other in debrief after meetings and I think one of the more common ones is they have this like an intensity is often the most common trait that we're seeing in these successful people because they're so different in all these other ways but the one thing they have is like once they see an opportunity they're pretty effing Relentless and focused on doing it they don't procrastinate they don't wait around they don't uh you know half do things or quarter do things they like overdo things and uh they do it like the intensity knob is is cranked past the 10 they broke the knob and it's on 12. uh I feel like that's been common for a bunch of people that we've we've hung out with over the last few years yeah yeah and I think like now that I see grade I'm like okay I wasn't great I could be great yeah he's great right right uh that's true the other one that was funny was uh we bumped into Rahul ligma at the Warriors game so if people don't remember this uh when Elon bought Twitter there was this guy that went and he was standing outside the Twitter office with a giant cardboard box and he was like uh yeah I'm a data science engineer at Twitter I got fired oh yeah Elon came in he fired me and you know and then the reporters were like oh tell us you know what what are your thoughts on Elon and and how does it feel to have this and he's like you know he says so this guy didn't work at Twitter it was a giant troll uh and he's friends with some friends that we have and he he had sent a text like an hour earlier being like dude there's hella people outside of Twitter I'm just gonna take a box and pretend I got fired you want to come and him and his buddy went took an empty cardboard box and tricked reporters from CNBC and all these places there's all these articles about with these these guys featured he said his name was Rahul ligma as in you know ligma these nuts and uh and like you know there's another guy Daniel Johnson so it was ligma and Johnson who were pretending to be to be fired and so they kind of went viral in Silicon Valley as like silica Valley loves when people you know try the media or beat the media or point out that the media is stupid and the media loves the opposite they love to point out when silica Valley is stupid and overrated and over hyped and over funded and all this stuff it's like a little war that goes on um and so Rahul was like he won he won a key battle in that war and so we're at the game I'm like dude that's that's the guy that's like again he's a random engineer startup founder that nobody knew like you know a few months ago and now he was sitting courtside at the Warriors game with two like billionaires and he was just hanging out and I was like you know this guy probably went to college studied hard spent 150k getting a degree you know I was trying to make a startup successful and the thing that like catapulted or like a random inflection point in his life that catapulted him was this random troll he decided to do and I think that's just kind of amazing and very uh I don't know there's a lesson to be learned in there what was your reaction to that yeah one I thought the troll was incredible like I think one you know I'm not an anti-big media guy but I have seen you know when you're on the inside of a story and what they you know how they spin it to make a great headline uh so I have one great troll by the way the best part of the Troll he's holding up a Michelle Obama book it was a cardboard box and he had a the Michelle Obama book and then they go what do you think about you know getting fired under Elon you know is was that right and he goes this would have never had happened under Michelle Obama which makes no sense that's so funny yeah and they didn't somehow pick up on that that this guy is just a you know this guy's lying yeah so good I don't think he's just like do things that make no sense like I think a lot of a lot of stuff I try to do like makes no sense why you would ever do it uh you can't like map it to anything going forward you're just like oh it sounds fun and funny so [ __ ] it like let's do it yeah we've talked about that before the do cool [ __ ] budget which is do you have a budget of both money and time that you allocate towards things that don't have a clear Roi except for that sounds fun or like dude that would be hilarious or that would be that that's amusing or I don't know like I've never done that before and I think you know the way Google had Google had 20 time where basically if you worked at Google you could spend 20 of your time on anything that you thought would just be cool for Google um so they you know they're like hey we're gonna pay you in one fifth of your time you can spend not on any project that we assign you or that has Roi and like Gmail came out of that and Facebook had these hackathons that were the same thing it's like these late night hackathons to take away a bunch of productivity from Engineers but they were like you know this is fun this is good for culture and good [ __ ] can come out of this that we can't predict and like you know the like button was built during one of these hackathons for example you know with the like button is obviously you know massive for Facebook and so I think that everybody should have this do cool [ __ ] budget so how do you put take 10 to 20 of your time and your money and put it towards things that are just for you know shits and giggles um I I know I do that uh I think we should do that with our companies I think everybody should really do that yeah I mean the one thing I try to do consistently is just talk to a bunch of random people that you know there's no real Roi but a lot of interesting stuff comes out of all those conversations yeah you should explain how you do that because um I gave you access to my Twitter and I was like I don't know I get a bunch of DMs I can't keep up with all this and you kind of took that and turned it into an asset so like what did you do and you you basically just blocked off like what Thursdays or something where you just have back-to-back rant like full random meetings with people that you think are interesting with no agenda is that like that's my read of it yeah man I think you know a long time ago I started by basically saying oh uh people think Sean is awesome so how do we DM them and just get on calls and meet interesting people and have no agenda and just shoot the [ __ ] uh so we're just DM people and say what's up this thing is awesome uh and you get like a 90 response rate sometimes it is a little weird because people will be like thanks and then you're like all right I don't know what to do with that but don't have people give you an opening they're like oh cool dude what's up and uh so I would be like how do I pour those into conversations to talk to as many random people as possible over time I started to do it from my own account uh and the main idea is just like No Agenda talk talk to someone about what they're working on ask a bunch of questions almost every single time uh I learned something that I didn't think about before whether it be like oh wow this company is huge or this thing they're working on is actually way more interesting than it appeared than it appeared when I first saw it uh and then I try to send them interesting things as I see them on Twitter like I think my best one of my best skills is I'm always on Twitter see interesting things that I just send it to a bunch of people and over time it tends to lead to good outcomes uh like I think almost everything I can count to or like say in my life is because I'm good at that on Twitter yeah like when I think of oh this person is great at networking I think about you know you know some like I don't know tall dude is good at shaking hands and making small talk and like you know some smooth Operator politician type dude and that's not you're an amazing networker but you are you do nothing like that and your method is first of all it's all online uh secondly you're just like you I feel like you don't overthink it uh if I was to kind of reverse engineer what I think is good what you do that's good is you find interesting people you compliment them on what they're doing that's interesting you then send them things that are like kind of helpful like oh did you see this or check this out or you might like this or dude I met this guy you should talk to him and you just like add Little Nugget one two three and by the third nugget they're like what I like this Ben dude this guy's this Ben guy is all right you know he seems to he likes me and he's helpful to me and like therefore you're interested in them and therefore they're interested in you whereas I think I always took that reverse approach which had terrible results which is I want you to like me so I'm going to tell you all the interesting things about me and like no matter what how interesting I am I'm nowhere near as interesting to them as they are to themselves and I think you do an amazing job at like just being interested in them and being like helpful not asking for anything in return and uh that's how we met and then that's how I feel like you've built for all the people I meet you end up with a better relationship with them and so there's something you're doing that's amazing and I'm trying I'm still trying to figure it out I think the other thing is like introducing them to other great people like I think that's always an easy win to be like you should you're having this problem meet this person who can help you uh that's like a great way to do it and then College I used to be like oh I just need to always check in and see how someone is doing for them to like me and want to talk to me like now someone did that with me I'd be like bro what do you want me to say like I'm good uh or I'd be like oh you went to Duke I should write that in my notes and like send you an email when Duke wins a basketball game then I kind of realize like what are you gonna think you know like what would if someone said who you know it every time the sun's on a game or I'd be like okay like what do you want me to say like thanks for like thinking of me that the sun's on a game uh so I was like how do I just actually understand what they want and like when I see interesting things just send it and maybe it's useful maybe it's not but they know I'm thinking about them in that moment goes a long way Julian Shapiro has an interesting version of this that he does that I kind of love which is he'll just send you an email with one image in it no no subject line no text and the images of random meme but it's like Julian's sense of humor is really weird and so it'll be like a picture of a parrot and then in the on the on the parrot's chest it says look in the top right corner and you look at the top right corner it says not this one the left corner you go to the left corner says not up here idiot down there you look down it goes go to the right corner you finally go to the bottom right corner and it says I love you and it's like he'll send you that and nothing else or he'll just send you like eight straight random images of like you know I don't know whatever gorilla is eating cake and you're like Julian what's going through your brain right now and I don't know what this is but it makes me laugh and it's just different and it's like it's really quick and easy for him to do this and it's like I don't know who this guy is but he's interesting and he's fun and he makes me laugh and like he does this like you know we talk about these things that like Sam does his you know let's [ __ ] when he gets into town and he he wants to meet somebody who he only knows online or he's friends with um and that's just like a better like more fun version of like let's hang out uh Julian's like random meme thing is interesting uh your your thing where you send little helpful nuggets of hey did you see this I think that works too everybody's got their own style but uh you know the style I think doesn't work is me me me me which is the the style that I had originally taken which was like well I'll just focus on what I want and what I think is cool and then people will be interested in that it's like no not really yeah and for a while I'd be like you know in college there are a number of people to teach you in college like oh make a LinkedIn post about your internship you're getting a lot of people are gonna care or like send people updates on what you're working on I'm like I don't know who cares that I got an internship at Walgreens you know and like if someone sent me that I'd be like instead send me something interesting or cool or ask me an interesting question or like uh send me something you found interesting about what I'm doing uh that's way more I think that's way more valuable than like what the other person wants right right we should add this on a few ideas we should do like five minutes of Rapid Fire ideas okay you go first uh first idea I've been thinking about is something related to your d2c business which is wholesale like one of the things I think been thinking about is wholesale so for people that don't know basically you have a Shopify store you want to sell more in micro micro Boutique so let's call it uh the local clothes store in your city right now that's really hard to do so I've just been thinking about someone could build something in a space that makes it really easy uh we talked to a company doing this that basically makes it really easy to spin up and run your sales Channel as it will say anything to add to that one uh that's a great idea and a no-brainer we have a person in our for our econ brand who we have one person dedicated to kind of doing this process it's very manual it's like find a list of all the mom and pop boutiques uh great now reach out cold in this script and it's all managed through Gmail and or you know some sales tool and then you know so like sourcing them um reaching out to them managing the payments and invoices um keeping track of your analytics who's actually who's do who's a big spender for you who's uh who's falling off and churning you should reach back out to you know all that stuff making it easy for them to shop uh because they're buying in bulk all that stuff I think can be uh I would love a tool that does this and uh by the way we should reach back out to that company that we talked to about this and be like hey we gotta do this yeah all right give me give me one of your ideas let's do two more all right you told me about um nil which is the college um name and likeness thing we're basically College athletes can now get paid so up until now they couldn't get paid now they can get paid uh to do you know appearances or merch or different things like that um I love businesses that are built around rule changes or Law changes because it takes something that was impossible and now makes it very possible and there's great examples of this like Oscar Health was built as soon as Obamacare came out um and so uh one I think that somebody should do is if I'm like you know 21 years old or whatever I'm 18 years old right now I would be like all right I now have access to a bunch of influencers that are in college that want to get paid and the marketplace is not efficient yet meaning they have more sway than they're priced at just because people haven't abused this channel yet so I'm gonna be the one to abuse this channel I'm gonna be the one to grow like crazy off this the way that the movement watches guys built a luxury watch brand using kind of cheap watches uh because they were like yo Instagram has these people who are popular influencers we should send them all watches and pay them to to promote and they built 100 million dollar watch brand before Instagram influencers became a big deal um so I think somebody should do this and it's like all right you should work backwards from what do who follows College athletes and what do they need so let's let's assume for a second that it's other college students at that college or fans of that college that follow them what could I sell and so what are the best products and so you know maybe it's Financial Services I like credit card type stuff or maybe it's like a beverage brand like an energy drink because I remember in college like people would drink Red Bulls at five hour energies staying up late studying I think you could create a new five-hour energy off the back of nil or you could create a new condom brand like I don't know how big Trojan or directs that these brands are but you know they've been around for a while they're kind of stale and they don't they're not that fun and I think somebody could build the uh the college conda brand or the college energy drink brand using these nil influencers yeah I think in general nil like uh I tried to book someone before using like open doors which I think today is like kind of the winner of the nil Marketplace basically the idea of I can book someone on demand for anything whether it be an appearance autograph etc etc I think there have has to be a startup out there that is doing this now in a really good way locally so we should find that startup too that like is attacking the nil Marketplace in a different way right uh all right that's gonna be it for the Pod thanks Ben for coming on and actually if you um if you like Ben you want to see some of the stuff one thing he's working on right now is we took every episode of my first million so we've done 400 plus episodes now um and we had somebody go through and pull out every idea every framework and every tool that's mentioned um and we're categorizing it we put it all into a giant air table so that you could basically see like what are all the ideas they had and then you could sort by like you know the ideas that were you know um all about AI or all about crypto or all about SAS or you know side hustles right for example and then I took the top 10 for each both Frameworks and ideas and I'm writing about them and expanding them and saying you know here's the idea here's what I would do uh for each of those and we're putting it together so this is going to be uh like I don't know some super PDF type thing so if you want that go to um go to my website go to seanpuri.com drop your email in and um you know I don't know how long it's gonna take us to finish this maybe another week or so but uh that's where that's where I'm gonna send it out so um so go there sign up and if you want basically to take the best of from the Pod and then kind of update uh you know I'm gonna update and give my commentary on on the sort of the best ones uh from there so I think that's gonna be an awesome resource for people if you're a fan of the Pod um you know I don't know it's no brainer it's kind of a must must have if you've been listening all the way through there's no way to keep track of all the different ideas that we've we mentioned on here so so I think that would be that's going to be awesome so I'm excited about that thanks for being for coming on and uh again I'll put the link in the in the description on YouTube and in the podcast but it's just seanpreter.com and then you can put your email in in there all right guys uh thank you for uh thank you for listening that's it that's the point [Music] thank you

so biology comes out he says I will take that bet you buy one Bitcoin and I'll I'll send one million dollars to an escrow to be clear This is 40 to 1 odds so he's basically saying not only is this unlikely to happen like if this was even odds it would have been like dang biology is going to lose a million dollars because bitcoin's not likely to be worth a million dollars then he added in 90 days which is already a radical move then he said I'm and by the way the million dollars versus one Bitcoin Bitcoin is currently at 26 000 at this at the time he made this bet he goes That's 40 to 1 odds that I'm laying you [Music] foreign we got an episode here with pomp Anthony pompliano who you may know as the Bitcoin guy he's huge all over YouTube Twitter everywhere else he uh came on we're actually going to do this as a two-part episode because at the beginning it was all business we were business in the front we were talking about this crazy million dollar biology bet where he's betting that Bitcoin is going to a million dollars in the next 90 days we talk about that why biology thinks it what we think about the BET and pomp does a you know I don't know econ 101 where he explains what's going on with the banking system from his perspective that was good and here's the thing though in that episode the whole episode is about something that's going to happen inside the next 90 days so if you're gonna like it is a little fearful listening to it and so actually listen to the whole thing because and do it now because we're talking about something that's happening in 90 days and then go ahead the second episode was way more fun and it was pretty wild go ahead we talk about his business Empire you know what he's building and why he's building it that way why he gave back all the money from his fund and shut that down why he is huge turned off all his advertisers millions of dollars of advertised what he's doing instead so we talked about that and then we talked about and then it went off the wall and uh the the Pod got a little crazy but in a great way I think people are gonna You're Gonna Love part two he broke down like all of his businesses and how they work it's very impressive it was pretty wild um and uh it was it was he's impressive he's significantly more impressive than a lot of people think I think because there's way more behind the scenes pretty funny stories which pop is usually he's pretty buttoned up on his on his main Channel because he's talking Finance he's talking serious but he told some pretty funny stories so the second uh part two is the more fun episode part one is the more serious episode I think you'll like them both and we have to remind you guys that our episodes we work really really hard and unlike every other type of podcast Out There Our stuff's not free but you don't pay with money all you have to do is go to our YouTube page we call this the gentleman's agreement what is it the ladies understanding the ladies understanding you go to our YouTube page and the reason it's called that is because it's an understanding it's an agreement we can't be there behind your screen to check this otherwise we would but everyone's doing it so just go ahead and do it and click subscribe on YouTube and then just go ahead and do that on Spotify and iTunes because the more you do that the more our volume goes up and we get more downloads and we could do keep doing this type of stuff pump ain't gonna come on to episodes like this if we don't have a big listenership same with all the other guests all right enjoy um pop we're live by the way we we always just jump right into this thing no small talk let's go what do you guys want to talk about dude you're I'm so glad you're here you are you are the Ryan Seacrest of the of the industry you are the hardest working man and content entertainment I'm so glad you're not doing your like 5 a.m show anymore um I'm sure you're also pretty glad you're not doing that every morning how does it feel to get some sleep I've always slept uh pretty well but the content stuff is um it's the best way in the world to learn you put information ideas out there and the people who agree or have like things to add they're super constructive and they respond to emails they tweet at you they do all that stuff and then the people who vividly disagree they make their voice heard you know very well and so you like quickly figure out like good ideas bad ideas and then you also get all these like rabbit holes to go down and I think that probably the reason why you know YouTube myself and many of the other people that we all know and spent a lot of time talking to we enjoy it like the internet is this amazing thing that we all get to use on a daily basis and so uh creating content I found is just this great way to uh to elicit like-minded people and uh and to learn so I was uh Pop I we have a lot to talk about and we'll do like a proper intro in a second but I was talking to my friend Jason yanowitz who you guys used to work together he works for you now he has his own company and Jason works pretty hard he told me that you were the hardest person allowance used to work for you uh he he uh him and his partner Mikey Polito they were uh the two guys who helped me start the podcast initially they uh they tricked me they literally came to me and they were like uh hey you should have a podcast and I was like what's a podcast and they were like you know like all these other examples and then I was like I don't know how to do that they're like well we do and little did I know they had no clue what they were doing they instead convinced me to do a podcast and then they dm'd I'm pretty sure Gary vaynerchuk's like podcast guy and it was like Hey we're gonna start a podcast like what equipment do we need it's like kudos to those guys I was pretty good hustle and now they have a media company that does tens of millions of dollars whatever it worked out and Jason works pretty hard um Jason told me that you're the hardest working person he's ever been with he said that they used to work at your office seven days a week and that you just for Non-Stop but then when I went out to dinner with you recently you told me your schedule it didn't sound very hard it sounded just normal so which is it which is true uh I think it's probably both so one of the things I always use as a framework is uh there's kind of gas and breaks in life and so at certain points you need to hit the gas and other times you can kind of like let your foot off the gas Coast as the car and then other times you need to hit the brake and knowing when to hit the gas when to hit the brake uh is pretty important actually you don't want to kind of be hitting the gas when there's a wall in front of you like you want to make sure you uh are able to kind of go all in when uh when it's necessary but the second thing is you got to last right you can't just Sprint all the time no matter how athletic you are you got to have some level of endurance and so that's probably one of the things that I've really uh learned to do over the years I wasn't great at the beginning now I'm probably pretty good at it but you know we're recording this on Monday yesterday was Sunday I record a podcast Sunday morning at you know 11 o'clock in the morning after I did a two-hour meeting with a friend at nine a.m and a lot of people are like that sounds crazy but I'm like no what did you do you like went and did all your hobbies I have no Hobbies I literally hang out with my family and I work but I do it because I enjoy it and so if you enjoy doing it like this isn't hard I'm like looking forward to today talking to YouTube because I'm like you know what they're probably going to be ridiculous probably gonna have a lot of fun and we're gonna learn something from each other like how lucky are the three of us two out of three ain't bad so let's uh we gotta get to this crazy biology bet and then I'm gonna ask you what you're doing with your life after that because I think well do you need a little Empire you have to set the stage for who he is right uh who pomp is okay so let's start with who pop is so uh I think you're known as like the Bitcoin guy I would say that's the that's kind of how you built your brand you've obviously done a lot more than that before that I think you worked at Facebook and even Snapchat for a little quick lunch and uh and and so you worked in Tech you uh started to build a big following on Twitter around crypto and Bitcoin uh built one of the bigger like newsletters and brands in that space and since then launched a bunch of like you know uh businesses around it so you had a VC you sort of had your own you know VC fund or you worked at least fun then launch your own you uh have like a kind of like a crypto jobs company you have a bunch of things in that ecosystem since then I think you've you've made some changes now so I want to hear about those in a bit but then we have this biology bet and uh pop why don't you just give us the quick 60 seconds on who biology is and then we'll we'll frame what this what this crazy bet is and then I have some inside info also all right so I don't want to be a spokesperson for Balaji so everything I say is my opinion uh this is my description of him this is my description of the BET um but Balaji srinivasan uh is probably best known now uh for being one of the more uh kind of public figures to have predicted a lot of what happened for kovid uh he was very early calling out hey this is a risk if this risk becomes a reality here's how bad it could get and you know again as with predictions a lot of it was right some of it was wrong but generally I think people point back and they're like man we should have listened to that guy he then went on like a two or three year heater where he kept making predictions and kept being right about a lot of things and so the internet kind of uh rallied around this idea of like the worst words to ever hear was Balaji was right and so when you build that type of uh kind of following and that type of uh reputation now people put a lot of weight when you say something and so his latest thing is Bitcoin is going to hit a million dollars in the next 90 days which sounds absolutely insane bitcoin's trading at twenty seven thousand dollars it's like you know whatever 40x from here and to do it in 90 days like we've never seen an asset really ever do that before now I don't agree that that is highly likely I would put it at like maybe I don't know five percent chance which is actually much higher than probably most people would put it uh but to me the most interesting part is like the reasoning behind why he's saying this and um you know I think it's important to call out the balaji's bet is like the best meme of 2023. he was able to essentially create a meme that has caused millions of people to now talk about this idea of hyperinflation bank failures uh and Bitcoin and I think that's ultimately what he was trying to do so if you ask them in a private room like hey do you really think bitcoin's gonna be a million dollars in 90 days he's putting two million dollars on the line so like he definitely thinks there's a chance but I don't know if he's at like 99.999 likely or if he's what is it what's two million to him is that a big deal or no it's hard to tell um so Balaji before he became known as the like blasia was right guy uh he built and sold a number of companies uh I think at least two that I know of had nine figure exits like he's like real right he's a great entrepreneur uh he worked in injuries and Horowitz for a while uh he was that coinbase as the CTO like he's a very real entrepreneur and investor and so he he's done well for himself financially but like I don't care how rich you are like you don't go publicly bet people two million dollars on uh Twitter unless you have some degree of confidence because in some way like 2 million may or may not be a big number but like your personal reputation is you know quote-unquote Priceless and so like that's basically what he's staking here is he's using the money to draw attention uh to what he's saying but really he's staking his reputation on something that a lot of people think is absolutely insane at the moment and the BET started because this guy Matlock I actually don't know who I forget his first name but he basically tweeted something and said like uh hyperinflation is not going to happen and then about uh biology replied and said I actually think it will happen and in fact I'll bet I'll take your million dollar bet that hyperinflation is going to happen in the next 90 days and this is related to the Bitcoin or that's another bet on top of the Bitcoin one then you wrote this post and you had one line you had a couple lines in there that I hated and I hated I mean uh it was like it stung me uh one of them was you quoted uh Lenin you know uh uh one of the folks who ran the Soviet Union you said there are decades where nothing happens and then there are weeks where decades happen you said that and then you had a few other lines and I started reading this and I got scared like I was legitimately scared and I texted you and I was like is this real and you're like um maybe maybe not I forget exactly what you said but uh you wrote this in such a way that I was I I was fearful yeah so I definitely don't want to fear Monger but I do think that uh there have been two points now in the last three years where it's like kind of a shake people and wake them up and be like hey pay attention right now the first was uh during March of 2020 uh I wrote a couple of different pieces people had similar reactions to it and you know one of the pieces was like I I basically was arguing that unemployment was going to be double digits and millions and millions of people were going to lose their uh jobs and I had people like privately emailing me and be like you are insane please stop fear-mongering like this is crazy and then the next week 6.6 million people filed unemployment claims right and so like if Balaji is like a plus I'm like D minus maybe analyzing some of this stuff um but at least what I want to do is call attention to like hey this is serious and like you should pay attention um because if this goes the wrong way uh it could be catastrophic not only for people uh with their personal finances but also like as a nation and I think it's also important to call out that like yes it is important but I don't think most people want this stuff to happen right like the United States of America is this amazing place there's millions of people around the world that try to come to this country and it's because we have democracy and capitalism and stability and like all the things that we know make this country great if we were to lose some of that stuff like this isn't about a financial product or an asset going up or down in price it's like if there is complete chaos in a country people don't care about what currency they're holding like they want guns right and like that's not a world we want to live in and so I think it's less about uh kind of finance and kind of investing and it's much more about like pay attention to this serious situation that's playing I think that's what blogie's doing with this bet that's what I try to get across with the piece that I wrote uh last week you also had this other line where you said bodies keep floating or you said a friend yesterday told me bodies keep floating to the surface meaning the Silicon Valley Bank that's just one body and we're going to keep seeing more bodies and so you like used a language that I'm fairly on I mean I have a high level understanding of this stuff so nowhere close to a lot a lot of smart people but you use language that that stung me and when I see people who like you who write like that it's almost like this is how I describe Malcolm Gladwell when I read his books they're so convincing Tucker Max is another guy who does this he's they're so convincing because they're such good writers and they're so so good at just explaining their points that I have to remember that when like a Malcolm Gladwell book it's like dude this is all just a a a theory and I could probably find lots of examples of why he's wrong but he's so good and you are so good at writing about it that I I begin to believe you and I have to like pinch myself sometimes like wait this is just his opinion and there's actually people that are probably equally smart and equally experienced that have a different opinion and I find that to be that whole thing though I find to be very confusing and unsettling it's um this Viewpoint that like you want to argue ferociously one point of view so that the response both the critiques and the support is as ferocious back right if you write a piece in it people are just like ah whatever like you know I've heard this hundred times like nobody even takes the time to respond but on the internet like you kind of have to go all in and really argue a point but if you are intelligent hopefully if you get new information or you see a critique that you're like oh that's actually a great point and you're willing to change your mind then you can very quickly iterate your way closer to the truth it's hard to always get to the truth um but I think that's kind of why I write that way is just argue ferociously and then you'll get the ferocious response and that will help you get to the truth faster what's the best let me ask one more question about this Sean really quick what's the best argument as well as the best person that you like to read that takes the opposite stance of you that you can see that you can you would say if I'm wrong I think this could be true like who do you who do you like to read that thinks you're wrong and they could be right so it's not on every topic obviously and even in individual situations I have friends who I agree on 95 of stuff with and then there's that one thing that they like vehemently disagree with me on and I actually pay attention more when they disagree than to the person who disagrees with everything right it's like once somebody has shown that they're a clear thinker and somebody's able to actually uh think through individual ideas and they don't just succumb to like oh Sam and I are friends we always agree on everything so like on this new topic I should just agree with him actually I want to surround myself with people who they are very clear when they agree and they're very clear when they disagree and what you want to look for is like volatility in agreement so the more that somebody agrees with you you pay attention and put weight on when they disagree and then the more that somebody disagrees with you uh that you want to pay attention when they actually agree so it's that volatility or that kind of reversion uh away from the mean that ends up being important to pay attention to but who who who who who are those people in this case is there anyone uh right now I would say so it's less about like individuals I think there's a whole cohort of people uh everyone has kind of a little bit different view but let me explain first kind of what's happening and then it'll help me under uh explain why I think that there could be a counter argument to it as well so the main argument is that if you go back to the beginning of 2020 uh the economic and financial system was like pretty good right unemployment was pretty low inflation was under two percent like we were kind of chugging along we've been in a decades-long bull market everything seemed fine um if not good uh obviously covet happens and the first kind of big shock to the system was all the government lockdowns right so across the world people said hey go sit in your homes when you do that What's called the velocity of money or the amount of Commerce goes down so if you used to go to the bar if you used to go and buy stuff at the store like you were just locked in your house now you're not spending as much money so when velocity of money goes down people get scared and when they get scared and they're fearful there ends up being something called a liquidity crisis and the best way to think of a liquidity crisis is just like you look at your portfolio assets and you're like I want dollars I want safety and so you just sell everything that you can to try to get dollars so people didn't care if it was stocks bonds cryptocurrency if they had liquid you know real estate assets they could sell Commodities anything they just sell everything and they want dollars and so if you go back and look and March literally meaning cash in a checking or savings account so that's like step one and then if you remember during uh March and April of 2020 people didn't know what's going on like I went to the ATM and I pulled out a bunch of cash if you were literally pulling physical cash out they're like well just in case right like who knows what's gonna happen they also were like buying toilet paper and doing all like the crazy stuff because fear takes over and so when these liquidity crises happen uh all assets go down and the dollar becomes stronger and central banks and governments have to make a decision they can say hey we believe in the free market we're just gonna like let this play out yeah it'll be painful in the short term but like the free market will kind of figure it out over time or they can what they normally do say we are going to intervene we're going to stay step in we can't let our people suffer and so of course like politicians and Central Bankers they're very short-term optimized because there's pain that millions of people experience on a day-to-day basis and it's hard to sit by and watch people suffer so it makes sense from like a human Viewpoint as to why they would step in uh although I disagree that many times they probably should not step in and so that's what they did they stepped in they basically dropped interest rates to zero percent which just made it incredibly attractive to borrow money right if people are borrowing money that means they're going and they're spending it they're buying houses they're buying all this kind of different stuff and then they also pumped between the central bank and the politicians trillions of dollars into the economy one key thing that a lot of people missed including myself initially is that regardless of how the money got into the system the money ended up in the banks so if they gave 1200 checks to individuals whether they bailed out the airline industry whether they created all sorts of stimulus packages whatever when people received the money whether they spent it or they held it someone an individual or a company put that money in the bank and so the deposits of these Banks exploded Silicon Valley Bank is a great example they had about 60 billion dollars of deposits to start they ended up having about 190 billion dollars of deposits so kind of 3x growth 130 billion dollars or so but what does the bank do when all of a sudden people show up like here's 190 billion dollars they're in the business of making money and so in a zero interest rate environment they can't buy short-term debt right all that means is like they're buying treasuries that are three months six months nine months 12 months two years whatever but all of that basically has no return because interest rates are at zero so instead what Silicon Valley Bank did is they went and they bought 10-year bonds meaning that they're going to buy a bond today if they hold it for 10 years they'll get back their principal plus whatever the return on the bond is now that bond that they were buying had about a 1.5 percent return right so you buy it today you hold it for 10 years you're getting your principal plus the the 1.5 percent uh type return over that 10-year uh period which is a conservative play Super safe super conservative backed by the US government like everyone looks at treasuries and like that's the safest thing to buy right now that is all good and fine if the environment continues how it is what ended up happening is that all that money got pumped into the system inflation exploded we had the highest inflation in 40 years and so now all of a sudden inflation's at nine plus percent in the central bank's like oh boy this is not good we have to bring inflation down because inflation actually doesn't hurt rich people rich people make money on inflation because they own assets it's the poor people the bottom 50 they're the ones who get hurt by inflation so let's try to get inflation under control and so the way they did this is they jacked up interest rates from zero percent to about 4.5 percent and then they started selling assets off their balance sheet they sold about a trillion dollars of assets when they do that basically they are tightening Financial conditions making it harder and less attractive to borrow money spend money what do they sell what do they sell the Central Bank uh this is actually a crazy statistic they had about a 900 billion dollar uh balance sheet coming out of the global financial crisis they 10 bagged it they literally went from 900 billion to 9 trillion between the global financial crisis in 2022. right so they expanded by buying all sorts of debt and treasuries and and various assets and that's how they get money into the system is they exchange the dollars for these assets and then when they contract or they try to make tighter Financial conditions they sell all of those assets right or a good portion of it to kind of get uh to pull liquidity out of the system but when they did this the banks are basically left holding the bag and what I mean by that is the banks took that you know Silicon Valley Bank 130 billion dollars 80 billion of it they bought these bonds that earn 1.5 percent which is great in the zero percent interest rate environment when they've now increased interest rates to four and a half percent that bond that you bought previously is no longer good it's actually cheap and so it trades lower so if you spend 100 on the bond now if you were to sell it to someone maybe you could sell it for 80 cents so you'd lose 20 percent on that Bond the reason why that doesn't matter historically is because the banks actually get special accounting treatment so let's say that Sean has a portfolio and in one of them uh he bought a stock and he spent a hundred dollars a share right so he bought a stock for 100 bucks if he goes to the bank and now the stock is trading at 80 and he wants to use that stock share as collateral they don't give him credit for spending a hundred dollars they're like hey it's worth 80 bucks like you get credit for eighty dollars not a hundred but the banks have a special accounting treatment where they can actually take some of the assets on their balance sheet and they can put it in a special area and they call it hold to maturity hold to maturity basically means we get to count what we bought it for not what it's worth today and the reason why they're allowed to do this is because they can hold the bond until the maturity the 10-year period and they'll get the principal plus the return so as long as they don't sell it before it matures then it ends up being worth what they paid for it the only time that this does not work is if all of the depositors want their money back at the same time because now the banks have to sell all those assets and take that money to give back to depositors and that's what happened to Silicon Valley Bank is basically there was a bank run when the bank run caused the bank to sell assets they lost billions of dollars which then scared more depositors so then they went and said hey give me my money back and it just became this reinforcing cycle and in 24 hours 42 billion dollars was drained out of the bank which caused them to eventually be insolvent and the government took it over and ultimately a great explanation that was awesome you killed it there biology and a few other people are betting that that's going to happen to other more consumer-based banks in the next 90 days is that right so it's already happened like this isn't just a Silicon Valley Bank thing like a lot of the politicians they this was like a a softball served up to them down you know right down the uh plate they were like oh great the crypto and tech companies are a bank customer it must be their fault but like silvergate Bank Silicon Valley Bank signature bank now Credit Suisse like these are not you know crypto Banks or or just Tech Banks this is a complete Global Financial uh system issue and now there's reports coming out that hundreds of banks are actually underwater in terms of holding these assets and so that's why you've seen the central bank and the governments around the world step in and say we will backstop a lot of these deposits because they don't want people to be so scared that they go in the try to take their money out of the banks because if everyone goes to do that that then basically creates a Cascade of Bank runs and so balaji's argument and why he's making this bet is that when the government steps in to protect the depositors that is an inflationary pressure and it's going to take trillions and trillions of dollars to do it and so at the same time you're getting trillions of dollars of inflationary pressure you also are getting this psychological Awakening and people are saying wait a second maybe the dollar isn't as strong as we thought it was I should look for an alternative and when those two things happen hyperinflation can occur doesn't guarantee it but it can occur and I think really if you kind of boil down his entire argument and why he's created this essentially meme with the bit signal is that people in the United States we've never worried about this but this is not new globally there are people listening to this podcast right now they'll tweet at us afterwards they're like dude I live in Argentina like inflation's like 70 80 year over year I live in Venezuela I live in Zimbabwe I live in all these countries where they live with hyperinflation on a day-to-day basis it's just that in the U.S we've never thought about it and then two is like you come you add complexity because the United States dollars the global Reserve currency so if we screw this up so bad that we hyperinflate the dollar I don't even understand I don't think a lot of people understand like what happens globally when the global Reserve currency hits high inflation or hyperinflation so again it goes back to like we don't want this to happen but damn people should be paying attention right now to make sure that they understand what's occurring and kind of how to prepare for it I can find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets serve dueling databases HubSpot grow better [Music] so let me uh add a little color on on what you just said so um there was a biology tweeted this out it was just a a like a memo or a note from the Kansas City office of the Federal Federal Reserve and they had said there's kind of this like one section that he highlighted which it said um at year end 2021 since basically two years ago only four Community Banks were below the kind of five percent ratio of uh of their of their assets that they had available so they were basically only four four Banks would be at this threshold that we would be worried about um fast forward to today that's now 333 Community Banks in the United States so 333 Community Banks are essentially insolvent is what this what this means and could be if there was a bank run on any one of these we would have the same problem that we had first at Silicon Valley bank and then what was about to happen on you know last Monday or whatever where everybody was going to go to you know I know here in California First Republic Bank was like you know the Domino that was ready to fall before they came in and said no no everything's everything's safe all your deposits are guaranteed don't worry um to try to stop that from happening because there are 333 Banks just in the United States that they say are below that ratio now what that would do to the next tier who knows and also uh overseas because the the dollar is the the reserve currency overseas there's a bunch of banks that hold um dollars and they're they're worried about what if there's a bank run on us um and so like you know just last night overnight on a Sunday night you know it's bad when they're sort of working on a Sunday night and you know making these announcements uh where they're like oh we're establishing this like swap line and it's like what's the swap line swap line is basically hey we'll bail you out too so if you need dollars the Central Bank of the United States will give it to you to European Central Bank and all these other places so they basically established this overnight back Channel which said if you need dollars because you're going to get hit with a run we don't want you to fall over and cause this Cascade of fear and panic and and withdrawals so we will also backstop you just like we backstopped uh you know the Community Banks in the United States so that's to topology's credit I think he is correctly identified just like he did with coronavirus that hey this might be a lot worse than you think um and there's actually data to support that the conditions are worse than you think now what's funny is apology actually did this twice so he had like a V1 of of trying to spread the word Sam I don't know if you saw this one so the V1 was he goes the bit signal he goes how do you raise ring the fire alarm on the internet how do you show it's not a false alarm I'm putting up the bit signal he goes I'll put a million dollars in Bitcoin to alert people about this stealth financial crisis I'll give a thousand dollars to the best thousand tweets that show a reply with a graph a stat a meme that will bring attention to what's happening because the Central Bank of the banks and the big regulars have bankrupted us they're trying to hide the insolvency of the banks to you the depositor which is a weird thing to do right that's like it's helpful that he's he's trying to help but it sometimes that doesn't help right this was a pure giveaway right that's not a bet he said I'm giving away a million dollars to the I'll give a thousand dollars to the Thousand best Tweets that will spread the word this tweet did pretty good 13 000 likes um and he tried but then he hit you with just like a bunch of like you know things that topology is like Light reading but to the rest of us it's like oh man like I gotta you know I gotta hook up to an oxygen tank just to intake this amount of information so it's like this uh this crazy thing so he'll tweet this table of like you know 45 currencies that have done hyperinflation he'll tweet out a thing that basically shows some random meeting minutes from the FED in 2022 that showed that they knew something right like all these these data points but it wasn't really going viral until this guy James Medlock comes out and he goes I'll bet anyone a million dollars the US does not enter hyperinflation and James Medlock by the way I think by the way he had it it was even scarier I think he said everything that we're talking about by the way it's in within 90 days of like last week right no no first it was just said I'll bet anyone one million dollars hyper reflection doesn't happen Okay that was just that was that guy sweet apology just takes this random by the way I I interrupted you say who he is say who he is I don't know who this guy is is Democrat markets the market is Market socialist in the sheets I don't know what this guy's talking about this guy's like it's a meme account it looks like so um you know he's got a picture that I I don't know who this is a million dollar bets yeah exactly the email is at mastodon.lol okay so like let's be real what's going on there so biology comes out he says I will take that bet you buy one Bitcoin and I'll I'll send one million dollars to an escrow to be clear This is 40 to 1 odds so he's basically saying not only is this unlikely to happen like if this was even odds it would have been like dang apology is going to lose a million dollars because bitcoin's not likely to be worth a million dollars then he added in 90 days which is already a radical move then he said I'm and by the way the million dollars versus one Bitcoin Bitcoin is currently at 26 000 at this at the time he made this bet he goes That's 40 to 1 odds that I'm laying you and he says all we got to do is find some you know a mutually agreed on like escrow or custodian um and he again he tweets out this bit signal graph and so he's like you know I'm doing this again now this this tweet goes viral this one gets 11 million views because it's more provocative it's it lets anybody at first the wave of tweets myself included was like biology is nuts he's gone crazy uh like this doesn't make any sense and uh and so you know because it was like Not only was the BET unlikely to prove in his favor it was a perfect bet for Mr you know James Medlock over here the social the Democrat in the streets and the Socialists and the sheets all he had to do was buy two Bitcoin right he could buy one that he's putting up for the BET and if he's wrong and Bitcoin and the dollar does hyperinflate Bitcoin becomes worth a million dollars all he had to do was buy a second one so if he could for 52 000 he could guarantee himself a Million Dollar Payday so it was like an absolute no-brainer and you know the poker player in me was like balji what are you doing that's a you've given this guy like a you know a no lose bet and so I messaged him and I was like uh you know hey apology this is crazy what are you what are you thinking and here's what he here's what he replied I I think I could share this because it's not uh not anything that he's not tweeting out he's tweeting all this stuff out anyways so it's not it's not overly crazy but here's what he said so he goes he just replies all the banks are insolvent that was the first first reply he goes have you seen The Big Short where one guy figured something out early and everybody else thinks he's crazy that's what that's what's happening here he goes uh people think this is a single bank issue like Silicon Valley Bank it was a central bank issue all the banks are dead 10 day days ago there were no dead Banks today there are five and if people realize this in the start to pull their money out they'll realize that the banks don't have it it's Uncle Sam bankman freed not Uncle Sam which is what basically what happened with FTX people realize the money's not in the the money's not in the in the bank with FDX and then that caused uh you know the extreme crash um and then he tweeted out a bunch of stuff and he goes uh he goes I'm not doing he goes yes I'm not doing this to make money because I pointed out that the guy could just hedge and win the bet he goes yes I'm not doing this to make money he goes if I had the beliefs that I do and I was just purely selfish I would simply just take the million dollars and buy 40 Bitcoin I would take you know another million dollars buy another 40 Bitcoin and I do it quietly because I believe that the US that the million dollars is going to be worth zero in 90 days I'm doing this to alert innocent people and to send a message get to the exits and so I want to bring up a couple of like cases here so that that's the best hold on really really quick there's also this other thing apparently right around this time there's a picture of him so this guy biology he's like has this like a picture on the YouTube video gotta throw out the picture so he's got the stereotype of being like you know like the forgetful scientist of like he's just this guy who only cares about being brilliant and oftentimes he's right and he's eloquent whatever there's a picture of him it looks like he's giving a seminar at like a university and someone tweeted he goes biology is uh saying get the F out of the U.S and it's and it's very scary and he's sitting there giving this presentation in front of like a class and he's wearing pajamas like a like a pajama looking hoodie uh basketball shorts and Nike Air Jordan flip-flops with his laptop sitting on top of like two cardboard boxes and so if you needed like this this any more of this stereotype of this like brilliant like you know of this uh the the image that we have of Mark Zuckerberg you know just sitting in a hoodie coding eating pizza and drinking Red Bull biology is going all in on that image uh and it it almost makes it worse when I see this picture but but I think a lot of uh why he has so much credibility is that he has been able to identify a number of these like exponential uh situations and if you really think about uh what he's saying here it's almost an exact overlay to covet right he saw very early on a couple of data points and he was able to extrapolate from a couple of those data points hey this isn't a linear line like this is literally an exponential curve and the top of the exponential curve is really scary like let me go yell scream and like call attention to it he's doing the exact same thing here and I think that's uh what Sean was reading about like hey 10 days ago there was no dead Banks now there's five like he's just trying to put a couple of data points and be like if this goes exponential like this is really bad and I think that one of the the components uh that's important to call out is like I don't know what the percentages of Americans but most Americans don't know that if you go and you deposit your money in the bank it's not your money anymore right like just that alone like the the lack of financial education of the average American is astonishing and so yes there's FDIC insurance that covers up to 250k like there's all these different things but if you go look right now like the FDIC does not have enough money to backstop every Bank in America or something I think the 20 of it was used to help Silicon Valley Bank yeah that's Silicon Valley Bank yeah Silicon Valley Bank is like the 20th largest bank in America yeah so it's like not not very big compared to the big big ones one other thing that I think is important to understand about these situations um is this idea of like a digital catastrophe and this is a concept that uh Frank I struggled a little bit to come up with like a good name for it but I think digital catastrophe kind of really articulates it uh as best as I can which is you need to understand this concept because it is going to become very very common in our lives over the next you know 20 30 40 years but the way that I Define a digital catastrophe is it's an event that occurs that is negative usually plays out in the analog world World kind of the real world but it is drastically accelerated by the speed of communication and action online and so Silicon Valley Bank is like the prime example right if you think about what happened there on Wednesday afternoon they made an announcement by Thursday morning people were scared by Thursday afternoon 42 billion dollars had been withdrawn from the bank and by Friday morning the bank was dead right so like in 48 hours it was the second largest banking failure in the United States history but in the old days what you would have to do in order to have a bank run is like Sean would walk over to Sam's house and be like yo Sam did you hear like the bank's probably not doing so hot and then like Sam be like huh that's kind of crazy and you would walk ride your horse maybe get in the car and like show up to the bank physically wait in line and be like when you get to the teller window can I have my money back like that takes a lot of time effort energy all that type of stuff now you can literally open a new tab on your browser click a couple buttons and move your money and so when the speed of information occurs that it does on the internet millions of people whether you're a customer Silicon Valley Bank or not like Twitter knew that the bank was insolvent by like noon on Thursday right and so if that happens that's how you get 42 billion dollars withdrawn from a bank that is a digital catastrophe it's the speed of information the speed of action online has real world consequences and so another way to think about it is like the internet was weaponized to create the second largest bank failure in history but it was in response to the knowledge of an insolvent bank that was caused by a fractional Reserve banking system and an increasing of interest rates that basically left the bat uh the bag holders as the banks and so people were just operating out of personal incentive to get out of the way yeah there's a there's a it was kind of amazing like a Thursday morning I remember waking up and in our group chat Sam there was like somebody posted Silicon Valley Bank stock was going down uh I was down like 30 or 40 percent it was like oh wow I must have had a bad earnings call right or you know that was kind of my assumption it wasn't anything too too bad uh you know by 11 or noon I'm scrolling Twitter and I start to see you know if you scroll that this is just a general truism if you scroll social media and you see four or five different sources talking about the same thing your brain is just like wired to be like this is now a this is a big deal topic X is a big deal marketers use this to their advantage when they want you to like Bunko buy a product or know about a movie that's coming out or whatever they do the same thing that's why they get why influencer marketing is a big deal but it also works just organically five people say the same thing on in one Twitter scroll I know that something's up and so I remember being on the phone and basically in the manner of like 15 minutes it was like I'm on the phone we're not even really sure what to do it's like uh let's just be safe take it out sent in emails to you know sent an email saying hey we're taking it out opened up a new tab clicked wire the money took a screenshot of the wire sent it back into six group chats then went ahead and tweeted out a thing dude it's like wow like in 15 minutes I just like propagated this more than I could have done if I if it had been my full-time job you know 20 years ago which is kind of what to your point and uh and the funny thing is people are mad that like um they're like well if there wasn't a bank run there would have never been a problem and it's sort of like uh it's you know they use this example of like what's it called like screaming fire in a movie theater or something like that it's like then everybody runs the exits well the reality is if there's no fire in the theater um Everybody Run to the exits and getting stuck there then you know trying to get out like it's not that big of a deal there was actually a fire and so like you know I don't know how the blame gets shifted to the people who successfully gotta got out of the fire versus uh pointing out that hey somebody caused this thing to catch fire which is kind of biology's Point biology he tweets out this graph of the like the the balance sheet or whatever it's basically like goes up up up up which is like during the money printing era then the last year year or so it's been trying to tighten so it's been going down it's been contracting and then like overnight it just goes straight up vertical like no graph you've ever seen because it's two trillion dollars was basically of liquidity was added to the market now some people say no it wasn't really like put into the supply like pop you might have an idea about this some people say well that two trillion dollars has not really being given out it's not going into the supply it's kind of just there as a borrowing facility in case the banks need it in order to like prevent any Panic um and other people say money particular Bird that's the same thing so you know what are you talking about here I don't know do you have an opinion on that you know when you're in like high school and uh there's the like but actually kid in class who like sits there in the corner and no matter what anyone says like but actually and they try to tell you about something they read or this or that or whatever it's actually called Barcelona [Laughter] exactly right Oh you mean bruschetta no I mean bruschetta Karen like that is those people on the internet right these people who uh they're the same people during covid that were like uh but actually and then they would go on some ranch right like no the government locked us in our homes and literally printed trillions of dollars and created 40-year High inflation and absolutely screwed millions of people I don't care what but actually you have to say and then you look at the same situation as like they were like but actually inflation will be transitory and it will come back down right and then you're like no that's not how this works and so ultimately what you end up having which makes markets so like this is a part of capitalism is you have Theory meet reality sometimes theory is a great primer an overlay on reality and other times it's not and what I've learned over time is that the more complex the system the less likely it is that the theory overlays perfectly on reality and like there is no more complex system than the economic economic system of America let alone the world and so all these people who are like oh inflation will come down because the FED will do this or that well like the FED isn't the only thing that contributes to inflation their supply chain disruptions there's geopolitical war there's like all these different components to it and so I think that you've got to be very careful just looking at Theory and trying to impose Theory onto reality but the other thing that I would say throughout this entire uh kind of cycle or or uh you know kind of news development man are we lucky we have the internet like the internet is the greatest place in the world and like Sean did a great job explaining you know you can propagate some of this information but imagine being in the 1950s or 60s and like you basically could read the newspaper and maybe you watch like the nighttime news and you have to listen to the talking points from the like public narrative or like the you know the the government or uh the fed or whatever on a daily basis there are things that are said by uh those who who kind of set the public narrative and within seconds people on the internet destroy the narrative and they're like nope that's not true here's these five points and like I don't care necessarily who's right or wrong every single time as much as it's like I want both sides I want what the people in charge are saying and then I want the people who like think the people in charge of idiots are saying and then I'll kind of like think for myself but the internet is what has empowered that and so like wow what an amazing time for us to be alive to have that ability because literally two generations ago they didn't have like what are you gonna do go to the encyclopedia and look up like what is a bank run right or like how does Central Banking work it's just amazing that we now have this capability so to I think we should wrap this segment up and I want to wrap it up by each of you in just a couple sentences saying what do you think is going to happen in the next 90 days and what do you are you guys doing anything Sean you go first okay so I'm gonna say uh two things I think in the next 90 days um I basically I think biology is actually correct on everything except for his 90-day point because I think that's too hard to know and uh he might end up being correct that something happens in the next 90 days or it might take 900 days and I think either way the important part is he's right it's just the time the time window I think makes things impossible but the good news is you don't actually need to know the time window to act accordingly I I've said this for a very long time and I think what biology is saying is a much louder better version of that which is for a long time people thought um if you're buying Bitcoin you're trying to make a buck and from the beginning once I started to understand what is this I was like oh this is not about making money it's about saving money it's a savings technology which is basically to say even when inflation was only two or three percent if you just look at two or three percent over a 40 or 50 year period the money that you have in the bank will still if you put a hundred thousand dollars in the bank it'll still look like a hundred thousand dollars but it will only have the buying power of something that's sixty thousand dollars for example and so why would you ever save your money in something that is designed to lose purchasing power you wouldn't like you wouldn't do that and so I don't think that it's a uh as I've always thought Bitcoins the core value of it is it's a savings technology it's a currency whose one big feature is it doesn't inflate and so you know if you wanted to save your money you'd rather save your money in something that doesn't inflate cannot inflate versus something that either inflates slowly or quickly right low inflation or high inflation I don't want any inflation if I'm saving my money and so anyways I think that he is correct about if you're going to save money you should do it in a hard currency that's not going to inflate I've already been on this bandwagon obviously been the kind of crypto person that's uh you know obviously a believer in crypto created the milk road because I believe in crypto still believe in crypto and so nothing has really changed there in the next 90 days I would guess that biology looks like a fool because people are going to point out that it didn't happen in that time period but in the next 900 days I think that he will be proven correct in 30 seconds pop what do you think or 60 seconds I think that Balaji is correct similar to Sean the timeline is hard to get there I will put a higher probability on the 90-day timeline than most because I do think that there's tail risk and mainly it's because when hyperinflation happens it happens very fast like in episodes of hyperinflation everything's fine 90 days later there is hyperinflation so it's less about like has this ever happened and it's more about like is it going to happen uh again I'm like maybe five percent because I do think there's very systematic uh problems and issues currently in the Global Financial system I do think that the banks or the central banks when faced with save the bank save the dollar will save the banks which will lead to inflationary pressures uh but I would not bet a million dollars that Bitcoin will be a million dollars in 90 days whew are you guys hyped up or what I'm ready to go get another fight we should say you say one thing which is the the the the the other take that people have on this which is that if biology has like a hundred million dollars of Bitcoin he doesn't need to be right for this to be a profitable bet for him so if he's got 100 million dollars of Bitcoin already Bitcoins uh Bitcoins up like 20 last week or something like that but it's up like you know four or five percent right now um you know he basically would only need to move it by like three percent or it only need to move up by three percent in order for him to be profitable losing 2 million USD if he's got 100 million dollars a Bitcoin which I suspect that he does have 100 million dollars a Bitcoin I I think he now has moved 90 I think he said this he's moved 99 of his net worth into crypto um and so so I I don't think I think he can be directionally I think he can lose the BET and still make money and be doing the thing that's you know to his beliefs the right thing to do which is alert people that the that the banking system is uh is currently broken and um and you know he is the Michael burry of of our industry so we'll see if he's correct dude I just feel like I drank just drank like a liter of Mountain Dew I'm just like drinking buckets of do I'm just like people want to understand now when pomp tweeted out that he's coming on people wanted to know how are you gonna sit in a room with the two of us and still be sitting there in cash ETFs and not own any crypto at the end of this segment well hold on 15 minutes of hell are you in on are you gonna go buy Bitcoin or what I own Bitcoin I own uh not that I own it from 2015 I've made purchases uh and um I don't have cash I have real estate and I have but here's the thing though which is in hyperinflation periods I own equities those also go up I don't you know to get to a million dollars Bitcoin right now is at twenty seven thousand you know that's like uh what's that like 50x or something I don't know if equities well 50x but I I mean they they will go up yeah maybe but also all those businesses run in dollars and all their earnings are in dollars if dollars are not useful anymore right like the whole system that's the thing I'm a Bitcoin Bull and you don't want to see this happen because the world will will be chaotic absolutely chaotic it will be bad for a lot of people I think everybody even who's the biggest Bitcoin Bulls you said this yourself pump you're not rooting for for it to happen this way a slow transition is really the only thing you want a fast transition would create a lot of damage and so you don't really want that to happen [Music] foreign

foreign [Music] Welcome to our Friday episode boys react we got a guest house filling in Nick how you doing Ben thanks for having me I'm doing great it's the Nick Huber show today yeah yeah exactly thanks for having me on um all right let's uh let's go through some news items uh do some rapid reactions first of all the big news everyone is talking about on Twitter is chat gpt4 uh it's the newest version of the AI uh it's programming simple video games doing pong on its own stuff like that uh convincing task rabbit workers to complete captcha for it so fellas what are your thoughts on the new chat GPT have you used it Nick I haven't used it I think these people need to go outside and touch some grass you're not a fan no I think it's all a joke dude you are so gonna get left behind I I'm I'm I don't use it but I know that it's gonna change everything uh darmesh from HubSpot created this thing called um uh uh chat spot and basically you can do a bunch of stuff but you can like talk to HubSpot and tell it what to do so you could talk to it like a human and like you know hubspot's really complex like it does a little bit of everything and you can just use normal words and be like make my website look like this or uh email these types of people who are on my list and I think that's like a really good example there's this uh you know what like the best iteration of AI right now is if you watch Monday Night Football you know how they put the one line or the the you know what do they call it I don't [ __ ] foul football first first down you know the yellow strip on the thing that's AI or you know how when you back up in your car and you see like a 360 view of like everything around you that's AI so my theory is if you have to say this is AI and the product is good because of that that's a horrible way to go about it but if it just freaking works all the time that's a great way that you know the product is gonna be good so anytime something says AI or web3 and they have and that's how they explain it I go I'm out but I'm convinced they're gonna figure out another way how to do this did you laugh because I didn't know anything about NFL no I think uh I think that was a great explanation and I don't want to like I'll preface this by saying I think these people are brilliant and this will be a tool that makes people more productive absolutely now let me tell you that 99 of humans and Americans and everybody else gives two shits about AI they're worried about enough money coming in their bank account on Friday to pay rent on Monday and if their house is maintained and if they have food to put in their kids bellies um it's absurd like literally we have a whole physical world there's grass that needs mode it grows can you believe we plant we plant this green [ __ ] around our houses that every week we have to go outside and cut it by hand with a lawnmower we got to go outside and do that we got to wash our houses we got to clean our floors we gotta install carpet we got to repair windows we have a physical world that's crumbling around the United States nobody cares about AI dude you need to get out of Georgia man you're gonna you need to get out of Georgia hang out with the real people in San Francisco and New York so you actually know how real people live Sam you didn't have me here to agree with you uh all right but let's do mint okay let's do a minute um we talked about a little bit last episode but T-Mobile is set to acquire Ryan Reynolds mint mobile he owns 20 to 25 uh for 1.35 billion dollars uh guys thoughts on this what's 25 of 1.3 the 30 300 million dollars yeah holy crap more so and then he how much did he sell what's it what's his gin called or whiskey or whatever the hell it was Avi Avion or something he sold that for hundreds of millions of dollars recently so this guy is killing it that's awesome I 25 seems like a lot of equity to give to him right I think it I think it's crazy I mean I think this is exciting to me and it should be exciting to you Sam too because it's an example of somebody with clout somebody with a personal brand somebody who everybody likes and loves which is in the definition of Sam par they've been able to capitalize that they've been able to capitalize that to an insane degree and I'm excited about what it means for people with distribution meaning if you have ears and you have eyes and people care what you have to say you can get involved in products and you can grow massive companies Sam's doing it I'm excited about doing it um it's just the beginning how much more famous is Ryan Reynolds in both of us a hundred times is he a hundred times more famous of course you think more more than 100 times so what's what's 100 divided what's his exit divided by 100 and how much money is that is that two is that two million still if it's 20 that would be a lot cooler but uh uh yeah I I think it's cool I I like him he's very likable he's significantly more likable than both you and I combined I think I'm like more likable that I'm a lot more likable than you and he's a lot a lot a lot more likable than me so I'm a lot more better looking than you and he's a lot more better looking than me uh I think it's awesome I like Ryan Reynolds so Kudos I want to know I've been asking him to come on this pod for a while I want to know does he actually do anything you know like what he actually does uh what's his day like I'm very curious yeah what do you think his day is like Sam I bet he's going I bet he's waking up he's taking a 20-minute meeting where somebody tells him yes the whole time that all of his ideas are amazing then they're going back and running the company without him or is he super involved is he getting involved with management is he doing marketing decisions oh I want to know how operationally and embedded he is in this company what would you what would your guess be Sam how many direct reports does he have at the company well zero I think he has zero I think he probably has the chief of staff who manages his whole life but zero I think that I I don't know much about MIT mobile if I had to guess I would say it's mostly a sales company meaning they probably just like layered on top of an existing Telecom and then just had a slightly different pricing structure and then targeted their marketing towards a certain type of person I think MIT mobile is more like a uh like a I think it's like a working class thing because it's like a it's all about price so I think it's like a really really low price here's a question for you Sam do you think a a serious operator or entrepreneur or executive is in the background overseeing all of Ryan's Holdings or do you think that he is that entrepreneur I think he's the guy man I think he might be the guy I think he might be a leader in these companies so but here's mitt's thing I said they're a sales and marketing organization because their commercials are wonderful and I think they're wonderful because he says a lot of funny stuff on the commercials and he just does a really good job of uh branding the company and I think they knocked it out the park with that where they did a really good job of being irreverent but still professional and I think that is what he does where he's like this crosses the line here's the line that we can we can tow and how far we can push it and I think that's what he does which I think is easily worth the 25 because if I had to guess it's mostly a sales and marketing company and he crushed it so this is a person that found an influencer with distribution they knew they could build a company that got him involved and they put together the ultimate system I love that business model I think it's awesome good job to Ryan Reynolds let's do two more let's do the original iPhone yeah let's do we'll do this one quick uh so a woman in 2007 buys an original iphone right when it comes out she keeps it in the Box doesn't touch it for 15 years and is now selling it just sold it at an auction for 63 000 what are your thoughts on that awesome you want to know what I collect this is weird um but so my wife Sarah worked at Facebook now she works at Airbnb so like these like pretty like culturally important companies where we look back in 100 years and maybe it'll be like a Ford or something or GE and so whenever she gets gifts like from Airbnb they brand it Airbnb I tell her don't open any of them and I collect all of them so I have like an Oculus that's unopened I have Airbnb swag that's still in the gift box I have Facebook a Facebook book bag that's unused I collect all of this stuff I love it I love collecting this like iconic company stuff and so what I want to get is a Silicon Valley Bank shirt I really or a Silicon Valley Bank hoodie or uh what's the Sam bakeman free uh uh yeah FDX or fbx I want to get one of those I Really Wanna I would kill for a thranos um or theranos blood blood thing like I collect all that stuff when Twitter was auctioning off a lot of their office equipment I tried to buy a bunch of it and I and it all it went all above what I was going to pay but I collect all that stuff now what I really want to get I want to get a monitor an old Apple a Macintosh monitor that has the apple with the uh like with the rainbow colors or I want to get the desktop Mac that remember the ones that were pastel colors like the blues and the pinks and all that stuff I want one of those and I just want to hang it on my uh shelf I love that stuff this is awesome I'm happy someone did this I fully support collecting and storing totally worthless [ __ ] I think that everybody should buy a ton of totally worth the stuff and put it in storage units right now put it all right in a storage unit and you can use a company called bolt storage to do that just leave it forever I think you should just keep it for all times but no in reality we bought a I got a funny story we bought a property at auction it had 187 units it was in Erie Pennsylvania we went and every unit had been abandoned we had to go through and saw off like the locks and open them up and there was dust and there was craziness oh that's some really cool things we found a ton of really cool things one one unit had like 60 bags of white powder we immediately called the police we never found out if it was drugs or not another one had a squirrel holding a baseball bat another one had an old Indian Motorcycle oh what type do you know what year I got a picture I'll show you the picture when we get off this call what did you sell it for it auctioned I have no idea like we can't we technically couldn't touch anything in the units we had to take pictures of them and have an online auction and the people bid on them and then they came and cleared out the units do you know uh how old it looked did it look like it was from the 30s no no no it was it was probably like not that old of a pretty dumpy one if I had to guess oh dude some of those old idiot motorcycles you can get 50 60 70 000 well that's awesome um that's badass that's a lot of fun actually to go and like see all that crap but anyway on board with this lady who bought it Ben did we know just some some nerd some fan um I don't think we know I don't think we know dude I remember when that came out in 2007 I was a sophomore in high school and someone was watching YouTube on their phone and we were all like standing around it and that was like it was like hearing the Beatles for the first time you know it was like it's pretty amazing it was it was mind-blowing seeing that so that's awesome um all right let's do one more all right last one the reason that Sean is not with us here today A Massive wind and rainstorm has left more than 200 000 people in the San Francisco Bay Area without power fellas any thoughts and prayers for a comrades For the Working Class People of the Bay Area any any thoughts for those people did that really happen I didn't know why he didn't have power uh I mean that stinks I think every responsible this is going to sound very radical I think every responsible man should have Provisions to keep their family alive for two weeks with no power and no internet what do you have no I'm not I'm not a doomsday person who thinks they need to survive a zombie apocalypse and build a bunker to live for six months but I think if you have a generator some fuel some ready to eat packages and a way to get clean water and a like Hungry Man TV dinners yep of course a way to defend your house if people come for that stuff you're going to be better off and every man should have that set up in my opinion it's like a very small investment and it goes a very long way if [ __ ] ever did hit the fan imagine being alone Sam could you keep your family alive for two weeks if everything if your phone internet cut off power cut off everything gone what would you do the grocery store no dude I I am a mini I'm not quite a prepper but no I'm prepared we have uh yeah I have that uh because when the Austin snowstorms happened and then covet happened and then when a lot of the riots were happening I I definitely got fearful that's one of the reasons why I bought my Ranch is we have stuff out there where we can bug out to so I'm on board with that um I don't think I'm ever gonna have to use it but uh I agree it's a very small price to pay for insurance what do you do with the gas do you replace it every six months no you put it in uh there's these things the military uses and you put stable in there and you can keep the gas safe for five to ten years you can order them right on Amazon for 90 bucks you fill it up with five gallons of gas that's all you need then you got a good generator you can keep your food cold and you know your kids kids warm if it gets really cold what type of food you have you order some uh I think Peak Peak is the brand p-a-k um it's like a little freeze-dried food that'll last 20 years and you keep it in a little package in uh in in January when whenever covet happened um I had this Chinese intern working for me he had family in China and he was a like a foreign exchange student and he was awesome and he was you know on what's the app that they use uh WeChat and he was like Sam this coveted thing this is like a huge deal this is it's going to come to America and I was like hung this is America dude we don't like wear masks we don't have these types of things that Asia has like this this doesn't happen here well you're crazy the next month he goes dude it's coming it's going to be here and then March happens and we see in the news the first case in Seattle and then eventually Bay Area and I was like hung you're right I'm wrong I am so sorry and I went immediately to the grocery store and bought as much crap as we could and like I had like storage we I remember like I I was like you're right now I understand why why people are afraid of this stuff and why like the peppers exist you're totally right and ever since then my opinion has has changed on uh a lot of this stuff so uh maybe it's like a man thing when you get a little bit older and start having a family I'm not sure what it is but Cove had definitely opened my eyes to like you know it's nice to prepare for this the worst case scenario I know a lot of guys who go way overboard and they uh like they have two years worth of stuff I'm not yeah it's a slippery slope that's the thing about prepping is it's a very slippery slope and you got to have a discipline hey I don't need more than two weeks worth of crap to keep my family alive but you want to know the other issue it's really really fun all the gadgets like the different flashlights the different generators like I just love gadgets so I just buy this stuff all the time I just bought Sarah this like thing that will break your glass if it go if your car goes underwater and you're like when am I gonna use this I'm like probably never but like it's sick it was only 12 bucks on Amazon like I love all that crap I'm into it the best way to Save a Life the best way to save life is put a tourniquet in your glove box everybody should have a tourniquet because a motorcycle yep a motorcyclist or a cyclist gets hit on the road 95 of time you could save their life by being able to stop the bleeding but a lot of people can't so put a tourniquet in your car dude you saw the other day how I held that t-shirt up to that guy's head uh like I saw a guy I saw a guy fall and I gave him my shirt and we stopped bleeding yesterday at the Meetup a guy was like uh worked in the military he goes hey I got this for you and he gave me a tourniquet and so he goes next time this happens here's how you use it and I was like all right so I have a tourniquet in my car now so I'm on board uh that's the news is that it Ben that's it thanks guys thanks for having me boys [Music]

foreign [Music] what's up y'all Sean here I want to do a special episode because the CEO of twitch resigned today and this is a guy I got to know well because twitch acquired my last startup and I worked with Emmett for a while he's been there for 16 years he was the founder the creator of twitch which is basically a you know one of the biggest Platforms in the world one of the biggest social networks in the world millions and millions and millions of users I think they have 8 million streamers let alone uh viewers that they that they talk about um and it's a multi-billion dollar company so probably somewhere between five and ten billion dollars in terms of what he's built and I got to sit in the room with this guy you know every week for a few hours at least interacting with them and over time You observe what is it about these people I've always wondered like what would it be like to work with Mark Zuckerberg what are they actually like how do they actually work are they any different do they just get lucky are they just though am I looking at a lottery ticket winner or is there something different about this individual that led them to do this and uh you know no surprise I think there are some differences some amazing things so I wanted to share with you some stories because at twitch's office there was nine floors and so at the ninth floor the top floor there's this boardroom it's got like 20 chairs and Emmett would just sit at the head of the boardroom at the table uh like you know some Emperor or something like that and he would a team after team would come in and they would present whatever's going on in that division of the company ads or marketing or whatever maybe and what he would do is he would sit there he would talk to that team for 45 minutes or one hour and then boom on to the next and so this guy operated at a extremely high pace and I want to share with you eight or nine things that I think were different or special or at least the stories I remember for having work with this guy so the first story I'm gonna call the birds fly story okay so I remember sitting in a meeting with Emmett and uh this team walked in and it was I think a Partnerships team our marketing team or whatever and they were super excited because um they had just they were like hey we had this great meeting with this company they said they wanted a pre-install twitch on all these phones and uh you know this is gonna get twitch you know a big head start in this market and uh it's gonna be great we're gonna we're projecting this much growth this much revenue blah blah and they were you know they were so excited they thought they were bringing in you know this Trophy and um and they were gonna just hold it up and get Applause from everybody and and hey it was it was a good deal but Emmett sat quietly for a bit he asked questions and then he um he kind of reminded them something he said you know I learned this phrase from Paul Graham at y combinator birds fly fish swim and Deals fall through like that's what they do deals fall through that's just a thing that happens and sure enough over the course of that year I saw so many teams come in and present deals that were on the table verbally agreed being discussed maybe even signed and this is exactly even to say this line and more often than that person was willing to admit the deals fell through and so this is something I took with me which is never to get too high or too low when it comes to Deals m a uh Partnerships anything like that just remember this is what deals do they fall through birds fly fish swim deals fall through all right let me give you a second story after we got acquired my first day I go uh up to his office and um I'm gonna have my first one-on-one with him and I don't really know what to do I've never been an employee really like this in my life so I don't really know I've only been the guy on the other side of the table so I go in and I start to tell them you know about what I'm working on and he just kind of like stops me he's like hey uh um what's uh what what's your question and I'm like what do you mean I haven't got to that yet I'm giving you the context he goes he goes uh uh he goes I think this will help in our one-on-ones there's probably he gave me almost like an instruction manual of here's how you work with me which is really here's how you work with any leader any CEO there's four ways you could frame anything you're going to tell me number one is hey I'm doing this FYI just I'm doing this I just want you to be in the loop number two is I'm doing this but I want your approval or I need your approval so I plan to do this do you approve number three is I'm trying to decide between a and b or a B and C can you help me think that through and then the last one number four the last way we interface with them is to say remember that thing we agreed on here's what happened it's the status update of the closing the loop on what we had talked about and basically anytime I interact with him that was the the sort of like the base frame that I needed to have which was um I'm doing this FYI I'm doing this do you approve uh can you help me think through which way to go I'm not sure which way which one I want to do or lastly here's what happened here's the learning that we had from it that just simplified so much and it made our communication so much tighter in a very short amount of time we could immediately sync up we could get through that and then we would spend the rest of the time just sharing interesting things or talking about what's going on in our lives uh because we weren't wandering around and he's sitting there waiting to find out like what does this guy want from me and I'm sitting there trying to tell him a full story before I finally get to my point or my question um so that was one great framework you sent me the second one was I wrote an update once this is point number three I wrote an update and he just took a pen and he just drew circles and rearranged things and he basically said here's how I want you to write this what why so what so that's a format of communication you tell me what happened why it happened and so what are we going to do about it or if we're planning something what are we going to do why are we going to do it and so what do you need for me in order to make that happen and that what why so what framework again tightened up my communication it took away so much wasted energy of trying to sit down with a blank piece of paper and figure out how I'm going to communicate something now I sit down with a paper and I try what why so what and then I fill in the details underneath so that was a great little uh communication framework that I got from him okay number four he is a fierce nerd so uh this is a phrase that I took from Paul Graham Paul Graham wrote this essay talking about Fierce nerds which is basically his observation of the best YC Founders so the most successful YC Founders he felt fall into this bucket and he talks about Fierce nerds as people who are competitive in fact they're often more competitive than non-nerds right like typically if you think competitive you think of a jock in this case he's saying almost a fierce nerd is almost more competitive because they are all in on this they don't have a bunch of other you know social things to fall back on they don't have the emotional maturity to separate themselves from the competition it is deeply personal to them and they are fully obsessed um he talks about how they tend to be overconfident sometimes especially when they're young because they feel like they can get to the right answer the fastest um and he talks about how big a fierce nerd is so advantageous in the world of business today and you know so so uh Emmett falls into this category when I asked him what he does on on Friday nights or for the weekend you know it was like I'm gonna play Settlers of Catan with the pat you know with the Collison brothers from stripe and the founders of Reddit this is what they would do they would get together drink beer play Katan I play a competitive board game or um during our first m a conversation I asked the Corp Dev guy after we got out of the meeting I said how did you think that went I thought it was pretty good what'd you think you know is he always like that he is no he goes half these meetings he's just playing Hearthstone on his phone and he's talking but he's playing he goes he put down his phone he wasn't playing Heartstone so that was a good sign for you guys and um this guy competes like a beast in fact I one time asked him I said uh can you send me something from the archives can you send me uh an old fossil so basically when you started twitch did you ever make any plans or or pitch decks or anything like that I'd love to see it because I I'm just like a I'm a nerd about that sort of thing I like seeing what people were thinking at the start because we all know what it looks like today but what were you thinking at the start and he sent me a pit a deck that he had made an investor update that he had made right when they pivoted to Twitch and uh there was this one it was a white it was no design it was white slides Black text Times New Roman and uh he just he was saying here's what we're doing you know here's why we're doing it and here's here's what's coming next um and then on one slide he filled up the entire slide to almost to make a point with every product thing they had shipped and improved that month it was just full like there was no white space on that slide and then on the next slide he wrote we are we are a steamroller plowing through a field of flowers I thought it was awesome because today he's older he's wiser he's more mature he wouldn't talk like that he's not like pounding his chest or whatever but at the time you could tell like that was that young bravado energy of feeling the momentum of hey look nobody in the honor at that point knew really what twitch was it wasn't a big deal but he knew he knew they were onto something he knew that they were making tons of progress and I always remember that we were a steamroller plowing through a field of flowers like what what a picture and uh and I love that and I I since now write that in my startups I'm like this month I'm gonna be a steamroller plowing through a field of flowers what would that mean what would I need to get done in order for that to be true and I just work backwards from that um I'll give you maybe I think this is number five maybe the most remarkable thing of the whole thing I talked about the early pivot so what people don't know is that twitch before twitch uh him Emmett Justin Khan Michael siebel they were working on something called Justin TV a lot of people know this story it was like uh Justin Khan was wearing a webcam on his head and he was walking around it's like a reality show of his life then it became anybody can broadcast anything which was like mostly people broadcasting illegal sporting events and stuff like that like just bootleg streaming um and so the site was kind of popular but it really wasn't going to be successful because most of their best content was illegal and they had a decision to Pivot at the time Instagram had come out and Instagram was hot but Instagram only did uh photos and so the majority of the company including Justin and Michael and Kyle they all wanted to do Instagram for video and they called it social camp and they pivoted to that and they wanted to do that and they you know all the top talent in the company wanted to go do that and Emmett had a different point of view he's like you know on Justin TV I really like watching these video game streams it only made up two percent at the time of of all the content or all the watch time that was happening on the network but he's like I like that content the best it's not illegal to do so it's the only good content that's not illegal I kind of wonder what would happen if we just went all in and made a video game streaming uh platform and he was kind of alone in that so Emmett went that way Justin and the others went the other way and maybe the rejects sort of uh you know got put on of its team to do that now social Cam went way up and then way down and I had this crazy spike in virality then it crashed and ended up selling for like 60 million dollars but twitch was a slow burn just Brick by Brick by Brick all the way into a multi-billion dollar company and so the reason I bring this up is because to this day Justin Khan is often referenced as the co-founder of twitch or the founder of twitch and I from what I understand I might be wrong from what I understand that wasn't actually true he started Justin TV which uh and then he went to social cam but like Emmett and his crew built twitch up from there um I don't think Justin really they were in the same office but I don't think he was working on Twitch actively at the time I don't think he ever was an employee of twitch I think it was helpful and Emmett and Justin are best friends growing up and you never hear Emmett try to take credit away from Justin or more towards himself I've never once heard him do that which is kind of incredible um and so I give a lot of props to that because a lesser man aka me would have been trying to set the record straight and and say you know no actually it was more me than it was this other guy who's more popular than me but uh Emmett couldn't care less that's his best friend and uh I think that says a lot about somebody so okay that's that's five let me do a couple more so uh uh okay if you go into a meeting with Emmett you're going to notice two things the first is that this guy's really really really smart he's smarter than you and uh I always wondered this because I think people like to think that it's actually hard work that separates people or it's um luck or it's one of these other factors but it not all not everybody's equally intelligent uh his oven Burns hotter like uh twitch uses the Amazon method of six minutes sorry six page memos before meeting so basically you write a memo about what's going on you're right you basically write down everything you come into the meeting you hand out the printed out copy of that to everybody at the table everybody silently reads for 15-20 minutes and then everybody has all the same information and now they discuss it's an amazing way to build a a very good culture in your company of writing thinking and talking uh so it's a great way to run meetings but the first thing you notice is that seven minutes in Emmett's pens down he's on Hearthstone because he's read the whole thing faster than everybody else and of course when the discussion starts he lets other people talk but then when he finally raises his hand and says you know here was my question it would always be the most on point thing that would cut to the heart of the matter and it's like oh why we've been wasting our time talking about these other things he's right you know he he made it he simplified the six page memo into a really simple question and conversation um and so his oven just burns hotter he gets to the right answer faster than most people he retains more info than most people he's able to connect dots and is more widely read I remember sitting in a meeting where we were talking about some policy you know uh how do we handle this situation uh streamers are doing this should we enforce it should we not enforce it should we change the policy how should we decide what how do we take into account what the community wants and he would you know be like well you know we could do it like you know the feudal system in Northern Ireland back in the 1400s like you know you'd say some like that and you'd be like Emmett we don't none of us know what you're talking about no nobody knows how the fuel system ran can you can you explain and then he would explain how their court system worked and then he'd be like why don't we do that and he'd connect these dots and all I could think about was like I can't believe this guy even reads about that I can't believe he knows about that uh his he is he's just like sort of insatiably curious very widely read and then you know his brain has uh this ability to connect data points in a way that I haven't really seen since then so his oven Burns hotter uh I think the people that run these platforms are smarter and hard working and blah blah they're they're the Olympic athletes of uh of business and uh and I think he's no different having said that he's got flaws so my next Point let's call it 0.7 he's flawed and he knows it so when I got there a lot of people would joke almost behind his back like well you know and it's all IQ he's no EQ for me it was honestly further you know could be further from the truth but I also met him I don't know 14 years into running this company I bet if I met him at year three or four he probably didn't have the same managerial skills or social skills or EQ skills that he has today but he knows what's flawed and he works on it so his favorite book I think was non-violent communication uh because that had helped him so much uh of how can he communicate with people in a way that doesn't put them on the defensive but still gets you know gets things done he uh only cared about getting things right not being right so he would use what I call the Socratic method of of leadership where when you would come in you would say something then he would start to ask you questions and he would break up your whole argument piece by piece assumption by assumption why is this true how do we know that if that's true then what does that imply next and he would just go one by one until we would get to the right answer for most people it was exhausting and they took it as almost a personal attack like he's questioning everything I say he doesn't just take it at face value but the reality was I thought it was a tremendous like approach to getting to the truth and the truth is all he cared about he didn't care if he came up with it or you came up with it he just wanted it to be closer to the truth to the actual answer um he also hired this coach this executive coach a woman named Flo who's amazing I think she's like 80 years old so she's like you know doesn't know the first thing about gaming or streaming or twitch or any of that stuff but she knew about people and I remember sitting in a one of the exact off-sites and Emmett has this nervous tick which is that when he's really thinking about something he would grab his neck like where his neck beard was and he would start to like twist it and it was like to anybody who's talking to him it's like so obvious you could see this and it's not like a normal mannerism people do but that was his twit that was his tick he would do that anytime he was thinking hard he wasn't sure about something or he was trying to figure out how to say something to you he would do that and I loved that and I'd I'd worked there for maybe nine months at this point he did it all the time you know I'm never gonna point that out what am I going to say like uh you know that it's just something he did and everybody just sat there quietly all of his leaders all of his peers sat there quietly letting that happen and Flo walked in and she was like Emma what do you do with your neck put your hand down you know sit up straight say that like a leader and she just told it to him like it is it was amazing she's amazing but also his reaction had zero percent defensiveness he was like oh yeah thanks like thank you that's a gift thank you for reminding me uh about that yeah I'm working on that and um I thought that that was you know a good sign as to how do you get better right this guy was there for 16 years how do you get better every year well you're surrounded by people that are kind of afraid to tell you the truth because you're their boss and you're the CEO and you're the smartest guy in the room so I think he did a good job of identifying his weaknesses and hiring people that would literally tell him the truth um so those are some of the things that I picked up from Emmett uh you know Emmett you had a great run I hope you you don't listen to the Pod but I hope you listen to this one because uh yeah working with you was a lot of fun you know I really found it fun because it pushed me to be better I could not walk into a meeting uh or do my job and be able to get away with it just on Talent OR Charisma or some hand wavy that you could say in a meeting that if it wasn't for him pretty much anyone else in the company if I went to the meeting I could kind of just say whatever and I could talk my way out of any situation uh or into any situation or whatever I wanted to do but with them you know I kind of felt like a higher bar was there where I really needed to have um the right answer I needed to have the truth uh because he would not uh his standard was there and so yeah he made me better I appreciate that and um it was a it was kind of cool to be able to be in the room with somebody who is you know one of these these rare individuals who has built one of these mega mega companies um and I don't know what he's gonna do next I think he's just had a kid uh so you know maybe he's gonna go full dad mode uh I'm not sure what he's gonna do but I will uh I will watch eagerly to see because I know it's not going to be it's not going to be average whatever it is there's nothing nothing just mediocre or average coming from this guy so anyways hope you enjoyed that those are some of the lessons I learned working with uh Emmett from twitch and uh all right that's it on [Music]

yeah no if now this is the theory this is the big this is the big part if you can make other people good at their jobs not just you good at your job but if you can lead other people and set them up for success and make other people good at their job you are the 10xer you're the 10xer [Music] welcome to my first million thanks for joining me Sam all right so Sean is in California there's a power outage last minute I called Nick Huber we're going to give you uh like the proper introduction but basically um you were on a month ago six weeks ago and it was one month I think it was the second most downloaded pod in the last 90 days it had something like 150 or even more downloads something like that so the people loved you and uh what what was your introduction last time Nick has uh at least 100 million dollars in storage units of which I am an investor in so I always disclose that and you also own three or four different companies right now that are doing really well or own part of yep yep dabbling and dabbling in a lot of stuff you texted me actually one hour and six minutes ago and you said hey can you come on the pod in one hour and I said yes and you said do you actually have good content and I said yes I'm a Content machine I was just kidding with you and you said hey you need to make a document and send it to me are you sure you have the fire you put the pressure on me because we don't ever I never asked the same person twice but I know that you're easy to work with and let's do that I knew you'd show up in time well you blew up you blew up my life man I mean I I looked back you you brought me on the show the very first time on November 11 2020. and then another time February 16 2023 which was four weeks ago today and honestly it blew up my world I mean I'm telling you really what are the results I mean support Shepard the company that I use to hire a lot of you know va's and and I'm a partner in 200 plus leads of people business owners who reached out for the first time to hire their first VA which is freaking awesome and that's like four grand a month or something or two grand a month it just costs about three grand it's 30 of the first year salary 35 the first year salary to make the placement so average tickets between three and four grand um all the other businesses too that I mentioned on there got some leads I'm Ari cost sag webrun.com uh it's just crazy man got reached out to by a lot of people and actually have have kind of got started with a couple more businesses since then so it's just been wild so I uh like I went to Vancouver and I was hanging out with some guys that were like worth hundreds of millions and maybe one or two of them in the billionaire range and we are having dinner and they would stop talking about that episode and they wouldn't stop talking about you and they were like I gotta meet Nick I introduced you to one of them um and uh Courtney and um but they wouldn't stop talking about you and I was like damn people love Nick it's amazing it's been amazing I think the the network effects of that have really impacted my life and man I have you to think in a major way so really really appreciate it we were at a I did like a MFM Meetup last night Jonathan organized it and we had uh 500 people RSVP I don't know how many people showed up but it was awesome we got to like meet people and uh a lot of people were asking about you and uh it was really fun to get out from behind the microphone because what people I always say this I said this last night what they don't realize is like Sean and I at least we talked throughout the week but we try to save our if we ever if we're ever talking about something juicy he'll just say like don't don't tell me tell me when we're live and right now I'm just in my I turn like a small bedroom into a little it just has his desk and a camera and you probably it looks like you're in the same you have like a small office in your house and like they don't realize that like we're just a bunch of like doofuses behind a mic just barely I mean we prepare but like we're just kind of like having a conversation with our friends and it's really cool to like see the people and like actually hear from them and so we did that last night it was exhausting but I was very happy to do it and so hopefully you you've been able to meet some of the people as well it's crazy because we can sit here and talk and I'm a little bit nervous just because I know the impact of my first million I know that 100 000 people might listen to this but imagine how nervous we would be if we were sitting in two chairs in the middle of Dallas Cowboys Stadium with a hundred thousand people watching I mean it would be a lot more real it would make it feel a lot more real we've had so many people say uh why don't you guys do it in real life like you and Sean like one and I'm like well it's just more convenient but also it's like one time I recorded at a studio and there was like this like lady at the uh at like the sound board and she was like hip and cool looking and was like a cute lady and I remember she wouldn't laugh every once in a while when I thought I said something funny and I got in my head I was like [ __ ] I didn't I didn't was that douchey was that lame and then everyone and then when she would laugh I'd be like all right I got her I got her I gotta keep going and so like she was my audience and I remember I was like changing everything I did and afterwards I was like Ben I can't do this with with Eddie these people in this room anymore it's getting in my head I'm trying to impress him too much it's tough man it's tough I'm having a live event on the 22nd in Athens um which you guys inspired me to do I put it together right after that and 30 people have bought tickets to it so I'm a little bit bummed out but we're gonna actually go through it's next Wednesday night in Athens we're gonna actually have it see how many people show up and see if it's a success but yeah when you put yourself out for a live event it comes with a new level of Stress and Anxiety for sure so I moved to San Francisco in 2012. I moved out there and I moved out there from Tennessee and I I'm still a little rough back then I was really rough around the edges and this was right uh yeah and this and this was like basically I moved out there and like P I would wear jeans and like boots and a white T-shirt all the time and people and I had a little bit of a twang you know and people would kind of tease me and I told them from Tennessee and they're like you know what do you date your cousin like they would make fun of me and I felt really like jealous of the Stanford kids I would like I remember I took a bus or a train out and to walk around Stanford's campus I thought it was like good a Goodwill Hunting moment I was like dude am I gonna meet all these Geniuses what's gonna happen and I got so envious and so I created this thing called the anti-mba because I was envious that I didn't get my MBA from Stanford because I would meet all these kids and they had this like awesome Network and so I created this book club and we would meet once a week we would read one book a month and we would meet once a week and go over the trailing like you know weeks reading and then I would call in a guest to like lead the discussion and I would talk to them and I posted an ad on Craigslist that's how I got my first people and so cieva one of my best friends sieva um who's like a big entrepreneur he was one of those people you know he's one of my closest friends so I met him that way and so I would host these book groups and we it would be 10 people at first and then the next time like 12 and then over time I did this for a year every week for a year I got like 3 000 people signed up to my email list then I hosted an event uh that was uh like maybe 80 people came and then I hosted hustlecon and 300 people came but it was very slow like these like events I do very like it was like a four year grind and then at hustlecon eventually we got like 2 500 people coming and so like these events and and then Sean and I did a live pod in Miami and like maybe a hundred people came and it wasn't that good and then we did it again and it was a little bit better so like these events it takes time and it's hard and it's hard because unlike the internet when you you know with the internet you can delete some stuff with an event you just are going to embarrass yourself you know what I mean it's so it is challenging but it was like a grind to do do those events and getting getting people to actually show up is tough I mean to get people to listen to my first million or my podcast the Nick Huber show all they got to do is flip through flip through podcast click a little button if they don't like it they're gone getting somebody to buy a ticket drive somewhere the uncomfort of meeting other people you know it's more difficult where do you want to go today what do you want to drive so I want to talk about the traits of a successful entrepreneur what made what makes a whether it's a partner an operator a manager at a company and when I say entrepreneur I don't necessarily just mean somebody who starts a business I mean somebody who leads other people inside of an organization what makes those people really really good at what they do and I think you have a lot of experience tracking down and identifying these people who are killers we'll call them 10xers they're the people who you know I have a theory that 80 of of workers are just kind of skating by and maybe they're adding a little bit of value to a company but the top 20 percent are generating outsized return for the company that they work for or themselves if they're an entrepreneur what makes those people tick I'll talk about that all right the most interesting thing part about this is that it's kind of this will morph into a tactical guide of literally starting a company because when you start to identify these things and you track down these people and you bring them together a company is nothing more than just a group of people that all work together so if you can find these people and put them together which I know you can which I'm confident that I can and anybody who scales a business can do um you can you can make a lot of money fast so let's dig in well when I when I first started my career it was basically just can I make enough money to pay for my own bills and then once you get past that point maybe that point is it's different for everyone for us it was in the thirty thousand dollar a month range once we got to thirty thousand dollars a month I realized cool it's sustainable to a certain level I need to hire people and I hired one or two people in a few of my different companies where once we got to like 30 and 40 000 a month when you hire the right person it can 10x fairly quickly and at that thirty thousand Mark I realized at a young age I am in the collection of people business I just have to collect interesting people and you have to play like a long-term game because it doesn't you can't they're not always available but if you like play the long game relationships last a long time so I've done a good job of collecting people and I you asked me this so I made a list um so uh four traits that I always look for the first is I look for emotional only stable people the reason I look for that is I'm not exactly the most emotionally stable person I'm the fire so when when it comes to starting stuff I don't need anyone to motivate me I'm the flame I'll get it started I don't need any gasoline I don't need anything of that like that but I need people who can when you're the type of person like me and you have really high highs and I can motivate someone I can get them to do crazy [ __ ] that typically those people it's almost like a comedian they're often if they're great on stage that means they're probably sad a lot of times or they get like down or like for in my case I'm like this is gonna fail this sucks and so I always look for someone who's like pretty stable and they're a rock who can like sustain like a pretty even pace and they I can motivate them to get excited but they don't get down too easily I also look for people who love you one at a time let's go let's go one for one you you say one trait I say one trait so for me it's it's very very similar to what you just described in yourself and it is that that fire that sense of urgency and that energy I think most people out there just in general a lot of people they they they're like they're in slow motion they walk slow they think slow they talk slow they make decisions slow they're just kind of lollygagging through life they go into work they clock in at 9 00 a.m they do the bare minimum all day to get paid next Friday and not get fired and then they clock out and they go home and drink a couple beers they're not that excited about Hobbies they're not that excited about much at all which is fine yeah it's fine I just don't wanna and you need those people a lot of times yeah which is fine those people are fine and they serve a purpose but then you get those people that have that energy you get those people that have that okay I'm gonna get out of bed today and I'm gonna attack this thing and we're gonna make decisions fast we're gonna move fast we're gonna talk fast we're gonna take action fast and we're gonna get [ __ ] done and those people when you bring them in they can do all the other things on this list I think everything else on my list and your list feeds from hey we are going to get stuff done quick when I started my very first company it was a moving company to pick up and delivery storage for students um we bought a cargo van on Craigslist for three thousand dollars and we drove it back to the track house this is kind of a good example of the different the way that people think about business and opportunity we were jacked up me and my business partner we were all excited about the idea of starting a company and going out and trying to make some money we drove this van back and we're like we're gonna start doing pickup and delivery storage for students and some of our buddies they're sitting around we're sitting around the track house playing beer pong and they're like you guys are freaking crazy what is exciting what do you know about that what beer pong no what do you what do you know about moving like you know like who you're not qualified yeah they're just like why is that exciting you're gonna go what we're gonna go have fun this weekend you're gonna go around and sweat and pick up boxes for 30 bucks a piece like that does not sound fun to me I am I have zero energy and zero excitement around that and they would have quit or given up in a week or two whereas we were energetic we're excited we got after it and we were able to convince some other people to come along and you know that was yeah that's that's the whole thing there's this great there's this great book Robert you know Robert Green the author Robert Greene he wrote that book 40 Laws of Power he has another book that was way less popular called the 50th law and it's really weird because he wrote it about 50 Cent and it's actually a great book you know I know it sounds weird but uh because he Robert Greene he's into like a philosophy and all this all this stuff but he talks about like rappers and he loves hip-hop culture and he uh and he's like 50 Cent is really good at this because he has done a good job Reinventing himself a bunch of times he's uh changed his image a bunch of times whatever and he said the key to 50s uh success was his sense of urgency and if you don't have a sense of urgency in everything that you do it it ruins everything and he doesn't just talk about business people he talks about poets he talks about people who discover um who invent different medicines like you know poets writers whatever it's always about anything doing anything doing anything that makes your life better is uncomfortable going out and meeting somebody taking a chance trying to get that really hot girl in the bar to go on a date with you it's all super uncomfortable and it's very very easy to just be passive oh I don't necessarily have the energy to do that I'm a step back I used I used to have a rule when I saw this is how I met my wife when I saw a cute girl who I want to talk to the I could only give myself five seconds after seeing her before I spoke to her urgency baby girl it was the five second rule because if you don't talk to them within a couple seconds you're never going to do it and the longer you wait the harder it gets and so I was with the five second rule um I have a couple more on my list you want me to go again or do you want to do your second one yeah go go one more okay so I think this one feeds into the next one which is when you're starting a company and people ask me a lot after our last episode where I spoke about the four or five companies that I'm starting Nick how do you have time to do this how are you doing it yourself and the answer is I'm not I'm going and I'm tracking down people who are really good and I want you to Riff on this two Sam because you're a master of bringing people together and I have this theory about recruiting employees or Partners or people in your early company which Step One is always you know the website getting your click funnels getting your copy writing down getting your service put together but then it's attracting people that's all it is as an entrepreneur all you're doing is attracting people I have a theory about this so 10 of people are in career Nirvana meaning they love their job they're perfectly motivated and they are under no circumstance are they going to go and do something else another 10 of people are literally actively looking for something else either they're unemployed or they really hate their job and they are very open and they're actively looking for jobs these are the people that are looking on job boards posting around you know for anything that might be another opportunity for them and there's 80 percent of people that are in the middle eight out of ten people have somewhere in the middle they like their job but they're open to other things or they could be open to other things but they're not going to go on Monster or on indeed or on LinkedIn and actually apply for jobs which typically is the those are the winners those are the winners I've every 10 extra that I've ever hired and I've been lucky enough to bring a lot of 10xers in into what I try to do and again it's kind of because of my Charisma and my sales ability and me really going out and putting myself out there and putting my sales hat on like I'm literally turning into a Salesman I'm going to try to attract talent to come along on my mission every single 10xer that I've gotten involved Falls in that category they were previously employed they had a job they didn't hate and they had a boss that really didn't want to let them go and my entire career has been built upon going and finding those people tracking them down identifying them and convincing them to leave that opportunity and come along with me how do you convince him it's it's sales it's literally I'm I'm selling them on my mission we can talk about which looks like what sales is another thing but I'm trying to make it I'm trying to tell them how they can win better than what they're winning right now with me I can either make them more money they can have a better quality of life we can do something more fun I got to get them to buy into my vision I gotta be charismatic and and convince them that they need to stop what they're doing they need to make a big life change which is a career is a huge change to make and they gotta drop it and come with me and you do the same thing Sam yeah usually what I do is I'll like I'll find someone interesting and I I just chat them up and I go I'll be like I usually like to flatter people so I say you're amazing what's your story and they'll just gush and tell you their story and I act interested because I am interested and then um usually I'm like where do you want to be in a handful of years what do you want to do and if they tell me something where I'm like oh I could help you get there sometimes I can't sometimes it's like I I can't help you get there but um if they if I can then I tailor my pitch around helping them get there and I'll say something like would you like to come join me for a handful of years and I bet you we could set you up nicely to get you to where you want to go and I tailor my pitch all about them and how I'm going to help them achieve their goals and typically what I do I've said this a bunch of times which is the world wants people to be vanilla they want you to fit into a very uh safe box and I think a lot of people dread that even though they are living that life and so I tend to go the excitement and fun angle because a lot of the times I'm not necessarily building the next SpaceX like if you're like work at Nasa there is some big Vision which is like we're putting someone on the moon or if you look at work at some type of company that's like creating a life-saving drug I'm like we're gonna save lives but I don't really do stuff like that I just do awesome stuff like fun stuff and so I typically lean into excitement where it's like look we're gonna build this pirate ship together and you're gonna be leading it or you're going to be contributing it in a way where we're going to agree on the rules but you could as long as you play Within those rules you could do whatever you want and so that's typically how I pitch I love it and when I'm making a key higher I do the exact same thing I call it like the motivational interview if I'm hiring somebody who's a little bit higher level I'm making an investment they're making a big change I need them to do some pretty important stuff I'll sit there in the interview and I'll be like Sam we're talking about this company right now but let's pretend that we're five years in the future you and I are sitting right here we're in this office in five years and you walk into this office and you are gushing you're excited you're like Nick things are going freaking awesome tell me what is going on tell me how much money you're making tell me how big your team is tell me if you're working from home how much you're working tell me what kind of projects you're working on and then I just shut up and I let them talk and I get to hear what makes them tick and where they want to go and if my company can't put that together sometimes it's it's a it's a really valuable tool because a lot of times 30 40 of time I'll be like wow um I can't deliver on this my company can't deliver on this yeah but then other times I'll be like okay I just it just gives you a look in how these people tick you know what I mean yeah yeah and you got to tailor it so the the third thing or the second thing that we won't talk about because we already did is speed I look for Speed um and that's quite hard to find most people aren't fast um my my current partner Joe Joe Spicer he's the only person I've worked with that I'm like Joe you're going fast man it's hard for me to keep up so I I look for Speed a lot but the third thing is follow through so people who actually act and I find that to be probably the hardest thing to find um and I actually a lot of things are trainable I don't think that that I think you either you you is or you ain't when it comes to following through and like actually doing stuff and what I tend to do is I like to look at people who have products or projects that are live so someone will be like where this one lady reply to one of our tweets and she's like I sold a hundred thousand dollars worth of Taylor Swift t-shirts and I'm like okay that's that's all I need to know you do stuff or maybe they have a blog or maybe they tweet or maybe they have a YouTube channel or maybe they um have some type of hobby that involves like taking action and I always look for those things it could be like I or I organize clubs in college just anything where I see like all right you follow through you say you're gonna do something and you do it I look for that a lot and you also you you've told me this in the group chat is that you will give them a small job and that knocks off if somebody's interested in joining Sam par the sampar ride and getting involved in one of your companies one of these things you're going to give them something to do and that'll knock off 80 of the people and because they're not going to follow us through they're not going to fall through I think the I got a good story web run the guy that I found to start this front-end web development landing page company his name's Will Wallace he's a coder he lives in Atlanta one of the most brilliant dudes I know and when I saw him I was like will I need I need I need a favor and I was testing him you didn't know what I said I need a favor I need a landing page and I need something to form up on my website I need it like right away and then boom the next morning I woke up and it was there and it was freaking awesome and he just moved so fast just got stuff done so quickly that speed and sense of urgency that you're talking about if you can find a way to get a look into their mind and it goes back to like Hey we're looking to assemble a group of people as an entrepreneur we're looking to assemble a group people how do you know who those 10xers are how do you know who those 10xers are getting a look into their mind with some of these ways that we're talking about like you're saying give them something to do give them something to follow through on like look at them often I tell them I get pitched like five times a day you probably do two people want to make short clips for me yep and I almost ignore all of them but every once in a while I'll be like um all right make me a video then and I'll tell them I won't I go I'm not even gonna post it so don't worry about free work like I'm not gonna I'm not gonna profit off your work make me a video then um and we used to do this all the time people would apply to the hustle for writing writing I go okay write tomorrow's email and uh yeah like I would every once in a while I would get a 1200 word thing the next day I go all right sick we'll talk what you're looking for is a look into the mind of these people to figure out if they're a 10xer so if you're going out and you're trying to build these teams you can shoot from the hip you can put bring somebody in from an interview and then you can make the hire or you can try to get a preview try to get a preview another thing that I look for on my list and these two blend together I'm gonna talk about both these things clear and concise communication so many people you'll have a conversation and you'll listen to them for 60 seconds 90 seconds and you'll be like what the hell is this person even talking about get to the point whereas you have Nick Huber on on your podcast I can say exactly what I've done and where I've been and how many storage facilities I have and I've given you three or four things to bite off on the first 28 seconds that I've been on the show because I'm a very clear and concise Communicator so I look for that I listen to that when I'm talking to other business people hey you're trying to tell me a story you're trying to get a point across how quick how clear and how concise can you do it and the ability to get points out how would you feel verse 30 is just mind-blowing how would you feel if someone referred to themselves in the third person in an interview like you just did that's a that's a that's a I'm out dog that's an I'm out dog right away [Laughter] everybody wants to hear about the social justice Warrior tweet that I had a couple days ago but yeah I mean there's a lot of red flags too that are instant Cuts you're just looking for red flags that's what you're doing somebody refers to themselves as Nick Huber in the third person cut out dude and the last thing that I have that's related is and this is hard to figure out a little bit but I look for Taste and intelligence Intelligence being like just like I always say oh my does your oven burn hot like are you just smart or um and can you like do you have like emotional intelligence but also um taste so I like to ask people what content they consume I'd be like you like to read what do you read yeah um yeah I'm like where do you where do you get your news uh or if they're like I'm like seriously just tell me like who do you follow on Instagram or what subreddits do you like to read anything I just want to know a little bit about your taste I've noticed that and that's when somebody puts you on the spot like that that's really tough because what they want to do is please Sam they want to say what you want to hear but they don't know it's like somebody saying hey what's your political affiliation tell me who you voted for I'm gonna be like oh oh I don't know who did you vote for I voted for them no and I don't care what they read I'm just like explain to me why it's exciting because if you're not excited about what you consume every day then you're boring and I don't want to be around you and you and and but I also want to know what their taste is because I'll hire certain people and they like write in a certain way that's maybe too corporate or uh like my brain is fun and so like if there's not fun or they don't get that I'm like this is just it's a bad culture fit that we're not going to blend well so I look for taste a lot and I ask them what they consume or I do this thing called the bottom fourth of the resume so at the very bottom of people's resume is like where they put like the Hobbies or like what they did in college and they'll say like I studied philosophy I'm like all right cool I mean I don't really care about philosophy but I'm like what was your favorite class and if they say oh I'm not sure I'm like oh you're out but if they like if they say like you know well this philosophy class which I don't even know about I'll just be like well why and if they can entertain me and convince me that it was interesting I'm like all right cool you're all right uh so I look for taste a lot on the bottom fourth of the of the resume is wrong every freaking time HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better I have a theory that uh you can get paid really really well and you can earn a great living if you're good at your job if you're good at your job you're worth you're worth a heck of a lot to a lot of companies what do you Albertson congratulations on that great Theory yeah no if now this is the theory this is the big this is the big part if you can make other people good at their jobs not just you good at your job but if you can lead other people and set them up for success and make other people good at their job you are the 10xer you're the 10xer so I'm going to look for delegators who can do that who can lead other people and grow the business Beyond because look if I hire somebody and I'm their direct report but they can't be the direct report of other people they're going to be a bottleneck I'm going to be bottleneck they're not going to help me grow the company now the two things that I think are related to that that are kind of counterintuitive number one is copywriting they're a really good copywriter I think that's directly correlated to be able being able to delegate and lead other people because if you can write it really and concisely if you can write like clearly and concisely the way people can understand it you can lead others you can give directions you can be on slack text email the way that we run our businesses is through the written word very luckily I can see how people write I can see it because they're dming me I'm reading their tweets I get to look into how they write and I think I took your your email course I want to talk about this because I took this nine months ago or so blew my mind it made me a better copywriter and now I have it yeah so Sam has a course where for 10 days in a row he's going to send 10 weeks in a row is it days in a row is it once a week that one day uh one a day for 10 days one a day for two days so two weeks you send an email that teaches people how to do copywriting and I did it I got the email the first day and I spent my wife comes in and I got a notebook full of copy written down she's like what the hell are you doing and I was like well Sam told me it's gonna work just trust me so 10 days I write and I copy these Styles and I start to learn how clear and concise communication and hooks and throw away all the words that don't matter where's that located again by the way copy copy that.com copythat.com so the word copy and then that yeah 150 bucks or something and it's been worth I would you know 50 Grand at it to my career easy the best do you know why that works I I tried to explain it in that in the thing it's called copywork and it's how I learned how to write and it was like this way that they used to teach kids how to write uh and in the 1930s and 40s I think there was like a change in the public schools and this thing got thrown to the side but um it's called copywork and like if like Ben Franklin used to write this way um 100 Thompson uh he like said this is how he write Judd Apatow the director and what they would do is they would find like scripts or like if you're Judd Apatow you would find like a funny script that you want to emulate or if you're Hunter S Thompson you would find you'd do like Catcher in the Rye or some book that you like because when you copy it by hand you start seeing the patterns and the uh the texture of something the same way where if you want to learn how to play guitar you're not going to like get the guitar in day one and write a song You're Gonna like play Jingle Bells and then you're gonna like move to happy birthday and then eventually you're gonna move to like rock and roll and then maybe blues and then you're like oh this riff from Guns and Roses it kind of reminds me of this riff from the blues if I'm gonna like I'll match that with this and I'll steal this from here and then boom I've got my own piece of art and that's why it's really good it and there's actually science behind it where it like it imprints into your brain and you learn the flow of certain things so if you could get good at writing and getting your ideas across and also selling other people because people think delegating is just telling people what to do no you have to make them want to do it and it's sales life is sales so it's it's a beautiful resource do you have a few more or no yeah I want to tweet so I want to go through how I think about sales because I think this is really important because life is sales and as an entrepreneur you're selling to customers you're selling to investors and and partners and you're selling to your employees just like I said you got to go find these people who have jobs and you got to sell your idea and your vision on them so I want to give you kind of a breakdown on how I think about sales and how I kind of flip the script and I can give you kind of an example of that the old school way to sell is you're going to be pushy you're going to ask directly you're going to speak the language you're going to prove that you're an expert and then you're going to talk about all the benefits and all the great things and then you're going to hand them a clipboard and ask for their signature I think that that way is a terrible way to actually sell people in today's world of so many options so my way to do it is I speak the language briefly and prove that I'm a professional without being braggadocious or bragging on me or the proc or or the product that I'm trying to sell then what I do is I dive right into talking about the downsides why I'm worried about it why the deal might not work all the things that we need to stress about and then I ask them given those downsides why they still want to do the deal or why they still want to work with me or why I still want to work for my company and then I shut up and I let them it kind of flips the script to where they I do that all the time they become the salesperson so like Sam you're about to start working for me as you know you want to come to work for Nick really bad and we're going to start this company together I'll say dude this is an agency business it's really hard it might take six months before we make any money at all we might be stuck in it worst case scenario we're going to waste a year of our life why do you want to come join me another really a great example of this is for my investors and my real estate deals they're good they get on a call with me and they expect me to just sit there and regurgitate all the great things about storage all the great things about real estate Investments the tax benefits why I'm such a good operator all that stuff I don't do any of that I get on a call with somebody a zoom call with somebody and they already know me they're already on a call they're already interested investing in storage so I talk about all the downsides I'll say look Sam Let's do an example here you give me this 50 Grand you're gonna invest with me and let's say interest rates Spike the economy tanks people don't use storage as much and all of a sudden this deal is worth 20 or 30 percent less than what it was and instead of giving you an eight percent cash on cash return I'm gonna give you a two percent cash on cash return now it's my job to make sure we don't lose the properties I'm gonna do this this and this to think about risk but why do you want to invest in storage boom flip the script flip the script and the person will say well Nick it seems like you've thought a lot about these risks like you're worried about this stuff I don't have to worry about this stuff I don't need cash flow off of this it's a long-term investment all the other reasons why you know it might work that way when you're starting these new things how much do you fund them with uh recruit jet we put uh uh 50 Grand in the bank account web run we put 10 grand in the bank account uh blue key Capital we're gonna put 50 Grand in the bank account did I tell you about Kevin right you know that is you're coming I'm doing what he does Kevin Ryan I've talked to him about him a bunch on this pod he's kind of my hero um he started he was the CEO of doubleclick which eventually sold to Google for multiple billions and it became AdWords or whatever AdWords or I forget the AdSense I think AdSense one of those like the the way Google makes all the money so it's like the best acquisition ever he was uh like employee 20 there and then he took over as CEO sold the company for multiple billions and then he went and started um he took like his whatever he made 10 million dollars and this other guy who worked at doubleclick named Dwight and they go we're gonna start this thing called silicon alley so they're based in New York so it was like their take on Silicon Valley and they invested he goes we would put our whole shtick was we're gonna invest 300 000 into a handful of interesting ideas we have and we'll try to find someone to partner and we'll try to make them big and we want big outcomes and with this method he started uh guilt you know like the women's fashion clothing company it it didn't work out but it got to like hundreds of millions of Revenue he started Business Insider which had a 600 million dollar exit he started mongodb which is a publicly traded database company at I don't know it's ranges between 20 and 30 billion on on the mark uh market cap uh what else did he start he started um Zola which is like the wedding registry business he started uh like maybe three other things that are big and he goes I give each company six months and 300 or 400 000 something like that and you know 300K is kind of a lot I mean it's definitely a lot of money but it's not that much money for how much value he creates and he gives it 300K in six months and that's how long it takes him to like figure out if an idea is going to be uh worth it it all depends on the opportunity I mean some of these the the guy that we're partnering with on recruitjet me and saho and Marshall from support Shepherd are starting a company called recruit jet it's a head hunt Us Talent this exact way like Hey we're gonna go into that 80 of people we're going to find them for companies the guy that's our head recruiter he's been a recruiter for 15 years he's done work for me he's a complete badass he's not going to leave his job he's not going to leave his job until we get our first contract signed like so we don't have any expenses yet on the other side of the table I'm trying to start a debt brokerage firm meaning we're going to be the middleman that finds and secures debt for Giant commercial real estate projects we're going to go to all the banks we're going to shop them we're gonna put the packages together and close the loans I'm right now on the road trying to attract a partner in that business I have somebody in mind I'm gonna have to Shell out a lot of money because this guy makes 450 grand for a bank right now he's our best loan officer he's a 10x or he's a killer I'm gonna have to make him an offer where it's a little bit less Equity less of a percentage of sales but I'm going to guarantee him 200 Grand a year for two years me personally off my personal checkout hey this is I'm gonna sign a contract with you because I already know how he thinks I already know he's a 10xer I know he's incredible he's done incredible things for our company when it comes to sourcing debt come to work for blue key capital I'm gonna guarantee you I'm gonna promise you two years of Runway at 200 Grand a year but are you gonna put any additional capital yeah we'll have to we need to hire some additional people but for the most part it'll be website landing page customer dot IO automatic replies to emails you know just be building the infrastructure that I'm so good at doing for all these other companies it will because you're actually going to do it you're going to write all the copy you're going to set up the email um web run I'm gonna have web run do that um and then I'm going to create a a a Twitter account make the follow account and then I do a a software called uh bird flow that has an automatic DM so every time yep you told me about it every time somebody follows the account they get a DM and they'll say hey if you're placing any debt on any big projects or you're buying something you need help with banks um give us a call and we'll just drive leads that way so it'll be does that does this person have a family what's that does this person have a family yeah he's got a 12 year old and a nine-year-old and his wife doesn't freak you out it's very it's very freaky yeah it's it's it drives pretty significant insecurity yeah I mean even will even will at rev run he had to leave a job where he's making 400 Grand to start an agency with me so like selling these people like identifying the 10xers and selling them on coming to join the Nick Huber mission like that's that's what it all is like that's that's the hardest part of this stuff the first family person that I hired the person that had a family they had children I remember thinking like that when we hired them I was like I have a family I was like I now have a family you know I was only 26 and I was like [ __ ] feels like I have a child and it's it shouldn't actually feel that way maybe but in a way it kind of should where I'm like oh [ __ ] like I have like if this is no longer just necessarily about me this is about like all these other people and stakeholders involved and I remember freaking out I was very nerve-wracking the stakes go up and it definitely have some times where I'll wake up at night and I'll be like what the hell am I doing like am I really thinking we can drive enough business to support this person and I'm convincing them to leave their job and their livelihood they make 450 Grand a year right now I'm I'm insane dude it's scary what about um what did you you message something you tweeted something out the other day that got you got a lot of flack for what did you what did you say I'll just read the Tweet because it's funny so um we talk about social justice Warriors a lot inside of our group chat um how many what what would you what's a social justice Warrior so a social justice Warrior is anybody it can be a supreme leftist or it can be a Trumper it can be somebody who is out on a mission to change the way that a certain group of people is totally mistreated whether it be people who want to carry guns or whether it be minorities whether it be uh you know people who feel a certain way from a certain place they're just out on a mission to go to war with culture to make it better for a certain group of people that's a social justice warrior in my opinion am I is that a correct correct definition that's significantly more positive than how I use it a social justice Warrior to me is someone who like is very close-minded very outspoken and will not be well balanced or open-minded to new ideas and new facts or and who will automatically dislike you because you do believe in something regardless if you're like for example let's say you're this is a controversial one but Pro or anti-abortion it doesn't matter which side you fall on yep you could probably have a conversation with either side a lot of people can be like well I disagree with you on that but I understand your perspective and I don't hate you for it you just have different opinions than I do whereas the social justice Warrior is like well you're wrong regardless of how you feel yep that's a you you put it exactly right so I made this tweet the worst thing you can do as an entrepreneur is hire a social justice Warrior people who are very radical politically are way more likely to sue you or your business upset your customers and upset your team members either side of the aisle I said luckily politics is not a protected class so I'm allowed to view somebody's social media and then I said these folks bash people that they don't know on Twitter and social media constantly um and I and I said you don't think they'll take to a public forum to bash you and your company when you fire them for missing work to attend the eighth Rally or March of the year and so what do people say to that no I didn't get any hate did you oh yeah oh yeah the people who it's got 64 quote tweets right now um this guy says bro just say that you don't hire black people it's way easier um like people are just really calling me a racist and calling me a lot of really mean things which I'm not at all I'm I'm I am trying to I'm trying to weed out people who are close-minded because if you're radically politically left or radically politically right that just tells me that you're not balanced because nobody that I know is super radical politically just a giant waste of time and energy so I just think it's a good practice if you're a business owner look at the way people spend their time where are they if they told you they were in Reddit anti-work when you asked them that question earlier like what content are you consuming oh I'm in Reddit anti-work uh okay out well I and it but they could make a good argument as to why they enjoy it so for example I like reading have you seen this subreddit called the what's the one where people have multiple jobs oh yeah yeah that is that is fascinating entertainment value is another thing it's these people who get multiple jobs like sometimes three or four jobs and though and I've known a couple people who have done this it's called overemployed it's called overemployed it's a pretty funny name and like I've known dude I've known people who have done this so they get a job at Facebook and Google and so they'll and they call it J1 and J2 and so they'll post like advice like hey so my J1 has me working from like I can get it done from like eight to ten a.m and then J2 is like noon to three how do you people like uh get your manager to only put meetings for J1 in the AM or something like that and it's crazy and I've known a guy who had a job at Facebook and Google 250 000 or something like crazy for each job so and they'll say like so total income is 600 000 that's broken up with J1 at 200 000 J2 at 300 000 and they'll like say this it's hilarious and I read it all the time because I'm like like well I'm pretty sure I'm against that because that's unethical it's not illegal but I wouldn't like that some did it to me but then I'm like but is that wrong and so anyway I like to like read that to like just explore new ideas and it's also just hilarious so someone told me they read anti-work or overemployed I'd be like okay why tell me what do you learn uh it goes really it goes really deep as I'm diving into the stuff on recruitjet and learning how recruiting companies work and I've talked to probably 15 Recruiters in the past month and just asked them you know what about there are people who will literally show up to an interview like this an interview like this and their mouth is moving but somebody else is talking to them and it's the people who are no way no way yes tell me tell me about that so what happens if you're so you're a recruiter somebody hires you to go place a tech position you're a technical recruiter you're going to find somebody to work for Google for 250 Grand a year you're going to go in and you're going to sort through Linkedin you're going to bring in all these applicants and you got to try to find a way to scan out a third of the applicants a third of these people are trying to get more than one job being a being a software developer and you literally can talk to them on the phone and that can't do it because then they can wire in somebody else to talk if you and that's why they do that that's why they do video is for that reason they have to do video I should have asked the guy a lot more questions about it if you're following me and Sam and you're listening to this and you obviously know about this occurrence tweet us because I want to know more about this as well but he told me that you're on a zoom call with somebody and it's blurry and and their voice is not really the one talking and it's people who are trying to get more than one freaking job crazy that's ridiculous that's that's that's kind of amazing and like there's some way you got to look at from a like that's sleazy don't do that but also you're like that's pretty amazing you know it's like a lot of my my sleazy friends in high school they would like pay someone to take the ACT form and I remember thinking like I don't know man that's pretty that's almost as impressive it's actually doing a good job you know what I mean I'm like I don't want to work with you but like kinda I do it's like if you can use that for good you see so many criminals get caught doing all this crazy stuff and you just think that if they put that energy towards something productive how rich they could get we had um we had this guy named Michael Harris Michael Harris founded Death Row Records you know death row they like created Tupac Dr Dre NWA like they basically invented like modern hip-hop or they invented like gangster marketing they were the marketing machine behind those guys right yeah and so Michael Harris partnered with Suge Knight and Michael Harris did it from prison he was serving um 25 to life he got in trouble for attempted murder which eventually he got exonerated by Trump two years ago and he got let out but he served 30 years partially on death row and the other charge that he was convicted of that I think he I I he admitted to doing was he was selling at times two million dollars a day of cocaine of crack and he was talking about it and he was like once I started getting all that money coming in I started realizing like I also need to go legit and do things the right way and so we started buying real estate and he started doing all this other stuff and he was like I was killing it in the drug game but like I killed it even harder like just doing the legal stuff like I you know he's like I had the cash flow from it so like I I definitely profited off of it but he bought buildings he started a limo company he um eventually death row was bringing in like north of 100 million in Revenue because CDs at the time were 19 and it was like a dollar to make a CD and he was like we killed it the right way but I did all this bad stuff so I had to pay the price I think he was like it's such a good example that business is simply a flywheel around these things that we've spoke about in this episode if you can get these things right attracting people leading people managing people delegating writing it can work in any business once you learn these skills I could put Sam par and I could take him and I could drop him in a grocery store chain and I guarantee you you would Thrive I guarantee you you could succeed just because of the way that you think about business the way that you can lead people and the decisions that you would make so um I feel strongly that once you get the flywheel going and once you push yourself and once you start to learn some of these things you can you can crush it you you're doing something that I hate doing and I advise most people not to do it but there's many examples of people doing it successfully of which you're one of them which is doing multiple things at once in most cases I think doing multiple things at once is a horrible idea I think we saw uh the few times it does work is when there's like a Ryan Reynolds you see Ryan Reynolds uh sold mint Mobile today for like 1.5 billion or two bill whatever it was and then like last year he sold what was his liquor his liquor or Avion or something like that he sold that for hundreds of millions and you know I don't have any idea but it says like Ryan Reynolds sells his telephone company and I'm like probably has nothing to do with it he just does the commercials maybe he has something to do with it I have no idea and I have no idea it says like Ryan Reynolds his his Telecom company got sold maybe he only owns like three points I have no idea but in that case someone like him he does have multiple things when it's you who you are doing a lot of the work and you're not you're famous or you're a big deal but you're not like everyone in America knows who you are I think that it's scary and it's challenging why are you doing more than one thing versus just one thing I'm I'm pushing myself I don't know if I can do it there's a lot of anxiety around it and some of these things will fail I mean look it's five companies that we've started in the past year um what will the collective revenue of those be do you think in 2024 okay so you want me to make a prediction and then we can come back on and test it actually so I think Ari kosteg will be doing 500 Grand a month or or so anybody in 12 months um in the year 2024 at the end of 2024 we'll look back on the year and I think it'll do 2.5 million ebitdon probably so okay um webron I think on what Top Line okay 30 margins so whatever that math is getting close to 10 million in sales yeah yeah I think Ari Costa will be really big in the year 2024 so 18 months from now like trailing um Titan risk the commercial risk property insurance company I think that one will do three million in sales at a 50 50 margin probably for insurance brokerage okay um webron I think will be doing 200 Grand a month uh if Revenue so maybe 70 to 100 Grand a month of profit um recruit jet I think will be a big company I think recruitjet will be 5 million of Revenue and three million of ebitda okay so collectively you're you're in the Six Million profit range or something like that seven million I forget yeah what would blue key Capital blue key Capital could be the big one the debt the debt brokerage company for Real Estate firms that one could be doing again five another five to ten million of Revenue as well pretty good margins the small team and would you so uh 2.5 million for cost sake what would that be valued at could it be as high as 10 times profit no I don't think so cost sag is uh politically dependent you know if if bonus depreciation rules go up and down it changes the demand for costs eggs right so I think three to four times ebitda would probably be the value of that company wouldn't be worth selling so the cash flow is awesome the multiples are [ __ ] everything that I've ever started typically the cash flow is only okay but the multiples are really really good this is this is one of our 20 times profit Yep this is what I can't stand I I tried to convince a kid to come with me to do a web development agency and I failed my sales pitch failed he didn't join me and he kept saying there's no Enterprise Value he kept saying there's no EV in web development and my entire thesis is screw EV will come I want to be making money every single month in cash flow every single year that's the goal and if we can do that good things will happen over time and we'll see which one of these companies really takes off but to play devil's advocate here when I was first starting the hustle I was doing the math and I was like wherever I want to be by the age of 30 so in five years after starting or four years after starting you have to make a ton of profit like selling a company if you can get 10 or 15 times earnings or three or four times Revenue that's a huge that's a huge number and for a lot of businesses it's not impossible to get that you know you need some type of recurring Revenue in a really big market and fast growth but like to make like 20 to 50 million dollars or significantly higher my argument is it's way easier to get there by selling selling to get capital gains there's a lot of people who have done it like Andrew Wilkinson's company is just like killing it and so he's doing it through cash flow um but if you like do the math Val yeah my friend Val is doing it but he also sold the company he sold the company uh he sold two of them for tens of millions of dollars I my opinion is and there's there's so many examples where I'm wrong but in most cases I think you it's significantly easier to sell something than it is to earn through income that's my problem Sam is I've never sold I haven't sold a company right now I've never I've never sold something to create a massive liquidity event so I don't want you yeah I think I would um the I mean unless you work in finance maybe like in your one of your company two of your companies are financially related unless you work in finance I think it's hard to get a significant amount of income but like I don't know like Donald Trump claims to have done it like a bunch of people have claimed to have done it through through real estate and finance but I think it's hard through a product a product based company if you can wait it out I mean time is on your side you know what I mean if you if you're okay living I look I live in a I live in a house that I bought for 290 000 I drive a truck that's worth about 12 grand um like if I can just not buy a private plane or a four million dollar house I don't have to sell anything and I think time will really help me so I'm on the I'm on the train how do you but how are you not like like you know desire is also like evil you know when it comes to this stuff like when you want [ __ ] you suffer and so like I know a lot of people that are really wealthy and every once in a while I fall into this trap where I'm like five years ago if I knew if if I my my five you know my 25 year old if they knew where I was today they'd be like oh you're fine and then I get to where I am now and I'm like oh but there's another step or what about a 10 or 20 million dollar home or what about uh having a warehouse full of cars or what about doing this or that or owning a sports team like okay you need more you don't desire things or a 50 000 watch or something of course I do man of course I do I really want an airplane I really want a pc12 and that's my goal is to have how much is that it's a five million dollar airplane and we could go from here to La without stopping for gas um that's a goal of mine but but why own it instead of I knew a guy I knew a guy who bought a Jet for 16 million dollars during the pandemic when he had just sold the company for 100 million bucks he owned it for six months and he was like what the hell am I doing with this and he ended up selling it for 20 million he goes I made a profit on it which was lucky but it was looking like a horrible Finance financial decision because I had to spend all this money to store it it was like it was the stupidest thing ever yeah it's straight overhead for sure straight overhead but I need to I live my family lives seven hours from here and driving with my family is something we're only going to do once a year so I can't get back to see my dad and my mom and my grandfather who's only got a couple years left without easy access to get back so it'd be really nice to have an airplane but yeah I'm I'm not going to do it like I decided with my wife we're gonna wait because I just want to show my kids that I'm not just going to go out and buy everything I want and I'm gonna suffer a little bit and that's okay and you know delayed gratification keeps me humble too and but it's tough I battle with it every day man I mean it's really easy but you want stuff what what's your what's your dream number like as far as personal net worth yeah if I'm making a million dollars a month I think I can then do whatever I want isn't that funny I but I bet you would have thought that 10 years ago if you are where you are now you could do whatever you want if somebody would have told me five years ago that when I retire I am where I am right now I would have given him a thumbs up and and said I'm happy please make that happen so dude the goal the goal post always changes it's so it's so hard man and it's easy for me to cry and say oh it's tough but it it's like a it's a tough thing to swallow as a man when like all of a sudden you have seven figures in your checking account you have hundreds of thousands of dollars a month that come your way and you got to figure out what gets you out of bed and how you're gonna not be an [ __ ] and how you're gonna raise good kids and how and I don't know about you but I get excited about hobbies and I'll pick up Golf and I'll or I'll tennis or pickleball or airplanes whatever and I'll just get really really really into it and then it's on to the next thing it's on to the next thing on to the next thing and I don't like that about myself I wish that I was more disciplined long term and how do you feel about that um I'm very disciplined I think uh compared compared to a lot of people I think I have a I'm fairly disciplined I think I uh we spend anywhere from when we're in Austin I spend fifteen thousand dollars a month or so when I'm in New York I spend a little bit more but because I don't drink and go out like Monday to Friday we don't go out at night because it's a school night we say we go it's a school night we're not going out um I live in a house that was is under a million dollars or paid well under a million dollars so which in Austin um um it's kind of hard to find that stuff but um I think I'm pretty disciplined long term but I do struggle with wanting more and my wife is always like stop wanting that like you're gonna drive yourself crazy uh and so like I do always want more stuff um and I try to like like I want like I want to buy just a huge Garage in Brooklyn and just stash all types of cars and motorcycles and then to have like a Fantasy Factory and just open up the garage door and just sit in front of it and anyone who walks by and like admires it I'll be like oh you want to come in and look like I'll show you around we could like play with it all like I want that and that's gonna cost 20 million bucks maybe like I I and and it's a pointless thing because when you die you don't get any of it but uh uh like high-end bourbon like how much is that how fancy you think of bourbon um the most expensive bottle was like 7 500 and this is going to make me you paid for 7500 you bought a 7 500 does it taste any different what's it do this is me being vulnerable I have zero life overhead like I could cut my spending to five grand a month and put my kids in daycare and pay for my house payment which is twelve hundred dollars so I've avoided like the big expenses I've avoided the big big house the plane the big cars whatever it is so I splurge on some of the little things that sound huge and obnoxious to some people but aren't really that obnoxious so I got some really nice bourbon some bottles that are really special and then I got him I'm looking at them in my bar and I send a text to like four of my boys I'm like hey come over let's try some bourbon and nobody can come over they can't come and hang out they're all working or they're out of town or whatever so the next morning I got up and I just looked at it I opened one of the nicer bottles I poured a little bit myself and I'm like [ __ ] none of this matters none of this matters at all it is all about the people and the people how they feel about you whether or not they care about you whether or not they respect you how you can help them how you can help them become better versions of themselves so the stuff is really just a distraction it sounds cliche because everybody says that but it hit me when I was looking at that bourbon and I'm like my parents my dad loves bourbon he's seven hours away my brother's nine hours away he's not here Sam par doesn't drink alcohol he can't come over with me you know what I mean yeah does a 7 500 bottle taste any different than a 50 bottle I haven't opened it yet it's the mikter's 20 year does a thousand dollar bottle taste any different you know I think it does because it sounds ridiculous no it doesn't Sam it doesn't it [ __ ] doesn't it's just a Pokemon card it's an ego thing man I'm a I'm a weak man who is after the ego sometimes and I gotta stay I just gotta remind myself of that it doesn't matter does it I bought like a decent car and that makes me happier but besides that most most items don't um what am I gonna do I can invite somebody cool over there's a couple pro golfers in town that I'm friendly with and I keep saying like come over and drink some of my nice Bourbon and what am I going to be that [ __ ] guy who brings in this famous person into my house and is like yeah drink my awesome Bourbon and just talking about how awesome that gets so [ __ ] dumb like I'm such an idiot I don't think it's dumb where do you where do you uh buy this from and you you do cigars too those are yeah so those are those are two of my hobbies it's cigars and bourbon because I share them both with my dad and golf can you be any more of a stereotype golly but my house is so weak like it's literally sitting on the bourbon is sitting on a 200 really shitty cabinet that I got from Home Depot when I read it in my basement but um no a guy over in Carrollton Georgia I'm his biggest customer and every year he gets the releases and drives it over to me and I give them an envelope full of a lot of cash you got a guy dude I love having Hobbies where you got a guy that's the best that's the best one um I appreciate you doing this we had a good episode um what anything you wanna you wanna pimp out or promote um a lot of people ask me where they could invest with bolt storage and real estate's really slow but you can go to boltstorage.com investors if you're an accredited investor and you want to get storage exposure and also my newsletter that I write every week I think a lot about this stuff a lot of the stuff we're talking about like what how many subscribers do you have on that I'm up to 42 000. I'm working it really hard I'm adding like 600 a month it's kind of kind of weak but uh I I write a lot about a lot of this like what makes a 10x or how do you think about this stuff how do you think about hiring management like getting this these teams together so if you go to if you go to my Twitter at sweaty startup there's a little Link in my bio and you can join my join my newsletter all right we appreciate you thanks for doing this [Music] foreign [Music]

foreign [Music] you want to set us up what are we doing what are we doing here uh well this is the first time the three of us have been on a pod so at least come on I think three or four times somehow you've never been here during during those even though y'all are friends you know each other and uh that's just strange to me but I think this we'll see how this goes I mean I think this will be fun the three of us here I wanted silly to come on because there was a whole bunch of like rich people smart people [ __ ] that was going on over the weekend there was the Silicon Valley Bank disaster Bank Run all that good stuff there's stuff going on in the stock market and so so is the guy I go to whenever I have questions I said all right well just bring them on the Pod instead I'll ask you the questions here instead of just uh texting or calling and so that was my that was my idea did you guys did you guys get impacted by this at all I had money in Silicon Valley Banks through my uh my fund uh so our our Venture fund had money through Angel list Angeles keeps all their money or kept all their money in Silicon Valley Bank and so we were lucky that I started hearing about it and I was like yeah I think we should get out and uh and so we ended up we had like 1.5 or 1.6 million dollars in that account um maybe a little more actually because they hold some for management fees and then we got it all transferred out to a bank I've never heard of they were like you want to move to grasshopper bank I was like you could put it in the [ __ ] field outside your office you know you can put it anywhere just don't leave it in the bank where they're where it's like a bank run is going on yeah uh so we got we got out like literally in the nick of time um so yeah we were almost impacted but not not in a like major major way like there were some people that were stuck tens of millions or even 100 million dollars so I'm sure you heard some crazy stories like what did you hear I how did it play out from your perspective yeah I was at this SV Angel uh founder event founder Summit in San Francisco on Thursday when the bank run was happening and um people all around me were on their phones trying to take all their money out of SVP and transfer it uh and people walked out of the sessions and were sitting on their laptop trying to do that one guy told me that he wired 70 million dollars out of his SVP accounts that morning into his personal Morgan Stanley account because he didn't want to wait for a bank account in the business name to open because that would take 24 48 hours which literally in normal circumstances that would be maybe not illegal but a hugely frowned upon definitely ill-advised yeah it looks like you're about to steal 70 million dollars of other people's money and put into your pocket but I think the people right away was it like let's see what happens because you know the the series of steps was I saw the stock price go down that was the first text I woke up to Sam in our group chat somebody who showed the stock was down 30 or 40 percent and it just seemed like a stock problem it seemed like oh the company is you know getting hammered but like dude I feel like I've seen that five times in the last you know five months it was something 40 but then somebody was like oh yeah could this mean that the bank goes under and then the wheels started turning in my head and fortunately I had seen I had seen and not acted on two crypto like Bank runs in the last year and been burned by those so my I'm a criminal under under reactor I don't really react even in cases of emergency which is good because in normal life usually things are not an emergency and it serves me well but when there is an emergency I'm also pretty laid back and so this time I I was I was smart enough to be like hey we should do something right now don't wait don't wait to see how this plays out there is no upside in waiting to see how this plays out did people recognize it right away where you were absolutely like hey there this could trigger a bank run yeah and I think in the beginning of the day no everyone was kind of chill about it but uh a ton of VCS I think starting with Peter Thiel said to their portfolio companies if you have money in svb take it out and take it out immediately like right now do whatever you need get it out of svb and let me explain I'm the least educated on finance stuff here so let me explain from a five-year-old's perspective what happened here so basically Silicon Valley Bank it's like the 19th largest bank in America something like that top 20 16th 16th and uh it's usually used by Silicon Valley based startups and other people who related to startups and so what happened was during 2021 22 when VCS were going crazy and startups to raise a huge amount of money they used Silicon Valley Bank so they took on tens of billions of dollars of new bank accounts uh but the and so they had all this new money and so what they did was they bought long-term bonds that yielded a rate of like 1.5 percent which in a way it was them thinking like we're just going to be conservative and like and not do anything crazy here with all this extra money then fed increases the rate to three and four percent and their customers which is startups with new cash are burning tons of money and lowering their uh deposits or their their savings and checkings accounts and then it became uh public on Wednesday stay at the quarterly earnings at the earnings report that they said um we bought these 1.5 bonds which is not good because the FED recently raised the rates to three and four percent which means our 1.5 percent long-term bonds are now devalued we have to sell a bunch of them at a huge loss people heard about that social media went crazy VCS tweeted get your money out immediately everyone starts pulling their money out and then by Friday uh the FED set or the government steps in and says uh we gotta stop this they're gonna run out of money this is not good everyone's gonna get hurt is that a good summary of from a from a from a dummies perspective of what happened yeah I think that's pretty good um I think that all of those things could have happened except if you know Silicon Valley is just such a um insular place but also such a viral place where everyone talks to each other so I think if it wasn't for the fact that it was Silicon Valley and everyone talks to each other there wouldn't have been a bank run this fast like [Music] um on Thursday when the bank run happened 42 billion dollars people try to wire out 42 billion dollars in one day out of Silicon Valley Bank how much money do they have 100 billion they have something 200 yeah something like 180 billion dollar in deposits so that's 25 25 cents on every dollar was tried to be wired out in one day and what happened when people tried to do that it just said uh no I mean what was the what what did they see on their screen in the beginning of the day it was working so uh this guy wired out 70 million dollars a bunch of other people at that SV Angel event were wiring money out no problem uh come the afternoon they couldn't log in to Silicon Valley Bank so it just wouldn't let you log in in fact I tried to log in yesterday I have a Silicon Valley Bank personal account and it also said uh you can't log in until Monday because you've I know in the past your companies use Silicon Valley Bank I think you you raised money from them so first were you affectionate and second why does everybody use Silicon Valley Bank uh I think they said 50 this on their website I don't know if it's true but fifty percent of venture back startups um used Silicon Valley Bank that's crazy is it just the brand or did they do something that that was like advantageous to startups yeah they do a couple of things so one they have strong relationships with all the VCS um and or so they thought yeah so they thought so they've they've had strong relationships with everybody so all the VCS are like doing their own banking all the lp all the Venture funds are doing banking at Silicon Valley Bank already and then they host tons of events around Silicon Valley and sponsor tons of events so you just see their brand name everywhere as the bank that you should use um and it kind of has like an elite Vibe a little bit which is yeah stupid because or that's not stupid but the the a lot of media headlines were like Bank used by the rich and famous or Tech Elite is going under and so the sentiment was like ah screw them which maybe that is partial part the reality a lot of rich people do use them but like payroll companies use them and when you there was a lot of companies like Rippling that the hustle used for payroll years ago where you pay your payroll to pay your employees Rippling is the inner is the middle man they hold on to your money for three or four days and then they pay your employees Rippling used them and so three or four hundred five hundred thousand employees of companies both blue collar and white collar weren't going to be able to pay their bill or weren't going to be able to receive their paycheck uh so it's not just like you know the elite yeah it's kind of the name's a little bit of a misnomer for whoever presents yeah the other reason we use them at tinico and this might be my greatest Personal Achievement was I got uh free tickets to the NBA finals uh from Silicon Valley Bank where they invited me to hang out in their box and watch the game so uh you know there's a bunch of perks like that for using Silicon Valley bank and then also if you raise any debt they're a huge Venture debt provider in Silicon Valley so oftentimes when companies will raise an equity round uh they'll also raise a little bit of debt so they'll raise you know 10 million dollars of equity and three to five million dollars of debt sometimes depending on kind of what their Capital needs are and so when you raise debt from Silicon Valley Bank they require that Silicon Valley Bank is your exclusive banking provider so all of your deposits have to be at Silicon Valley Bank as well that way they've got visibility into it and that kind of thing so a ton of startups will get debt and then they have to use Silicon Valley Bank as their bank so they have no other choice and over the weekend basically there was a bunch of people we have a bunch of our mutual friends where they were just like sitting there Friday to Saturday and Sunday morning thinking I think I just had all my money's gone I don't know what's gonna happen I was with like maybe a dozen people and they're like you know I've had hundreds of thousands or tens of millions of dollars I just don't have that and I have no idea how I'm gonna pay my employees I don't know what's gonna happen a Sunday night we find out that everything's gonna be fine the the corporation Silicon Valley Bank is going under if you're a stockholder in that I think you're going to lose everything if you're a bondholder in that company I think you're going to lose everything but if you're a depositor if you're a customer you're going to be made whole and so it's no big deal I think you can access your money now uh is that right is that how this is currently being resolved yeah that's exactly right so the Federal Reserve and um U.S treasury Department were like if Silicon Valley Bank depositors lose their money this is going to create a systemic risk that systemic risk is everyone who has money in these 2 000 local Community Regional Banks is going to take their money out Monday morning because they're afraid that their personal bank will have a bank run also so which would this is literally what I've grown also right like anybody being proactive would be triggering an actual bank run across many many other Banks and so they had to they had to basically get people to chill before Monday morning yeah exactly like First Republic Bank is a bank that I use and a ton of other startups use and in fact First Republic Bank provides is the bank that Mark Zuckerberg uses to get loans for from for buying a house or just getting a loan against a stock um and there were rumors over the weekend a bunch of my finance friends in New York texted me and said hey do you have any money at First Republic Bank if so get it out Monday morning well so today it's down 65 so even though this happened uh why is it still down so bad I think people are just still afraid that there's gonna be uh that depositors are still going to take money out of First Republic Bank there was a funny there was a funny um headline and it said that um you know when you think of this you think of like literal pitchforks and like guys wearing straw hats and like torches standing outside of the bank because there was like a headline that says people are rallying outside the bank just banging on doors to get in and you think like you know like a pitchfork mob and it was really it was like eight or nine like Asian guys wearing Facebook book bags and like North Face sweaters and they and they were smiling at the camera like this this article like they look really happy they're like waving at the camera uh and I saw that because it was a pretty funny thing well I think that was part of the problem here was like like you said in Silicon Valley everybody's so tightly networked that like Words spread like wildfire and then back in 2008 when the global financial crisis happened in the the sort of the other bank failures happened there wasn't really like like Twitter was very new at that point in time smartphones had only come out that same year so it wasn't like as fast so this was basically like a bunch of people who are all incestuous and all talk to each other a ton on top of that you can now do online banking and just quickly log into your phone or your laptop and wire out 70 million dollars you don't even need to go to the bank like normally it's like Bank Run there's going to be a huge line and that huge line itself is a like barrier to this happening but in this case everybody talked about it everybody moved it out digitally and word started spreading um you know basically fear started spreading across Twitter Tick Tock and other places and it just felt like it's the end of the world uh you know move now and that that sped this whole thing up up into a one day like tsunami Financial tsunami that that hit um what do you think about like it's crazy because the I bet the CEO of Silicon Valley Bank woke up Thursday morning and was like what's the big deal guys this is gonna be fine and uh was it a big deal silly like besides the the fear was it actually that big like was the was the business itself at risk um there is some there's a real problem with the Silicon Valley balance sheet uh because of the the sort of depositors taking money out in general so even before Wednesday um because of all of the startups that because the startups are the ones that bank at Silicon Valley Bank they were withdrawing money every week to pay payroll and uh because of their burn rates um so there was already a problem but I think that you know Regulators are monitoring bank balance sheet on a monthly basis very closely so they were like this is all fine uh up until that point and so nobody thought this was a problem like the Silicon Valley Bank CEO was like this isn't a problem Regulators thought this isn't a problem yeah but he had one line that was bad he goes I we don't panic I think he said Don't Panic exactly he did such a terrible job of PR and um the way that they came out on Wednesday and said hey we're going to raise 1.8 billion we are going to raise two billion dollars because we lost 1.8 billion dollars like they just mismanaged this from a PR perspective and I think if they'd done a better job of that they wouldn't have gone wouldn't be dead today and to to um Sean's Point around just the speed of this happening so the biggest bank failure in American history is Washington Mutual in 2008 and in 2008 10 17 billion dollars was removed from Washington uh withdrawn from Washington Mutual in 10 days and in Silicon Valley Bank it was 42 billion dollars in one day on Thursday so just the speed with Which business happens is like you know so much faster now and I want you I want to get your reaction to two people so Peter Thiel some people are like oh Peter's teal strikes again he's the you know this guy's the Menace and then they're like he brought down Gawker he got Trump elected and now he he triggered the bank run of silica Valley Bank so Peter you know do you think that that's uh is it is there is there any truth to that and then the other side is Mark suster who's another VC down in La who basically came out during the process and was like this is like like you should companies you should keep your money there support Silicon Valley Bank it supported us uh there's you know we don't have to have this hysteria if we don't do the bank run there's there won't be a bank run I'm you know keep your money there and if you know for people who had listened he could have caused them to basically you know lose or lose access to the majority of their money so what do you think about those two people and where do you play place the sort of how much blame or credit do you do you give to those people uh I do think Peter Thiel has a ton of power he's like this Godfather of Silicon Valley uh you know we had a tiny cowboy and Mark Andreessen on our board and he would never mention what anyone else says except he would constantly mention what Peter Thiel says so I think what's an example um and why uh I think he just Mark Andreessen I think just looks up to uh Peter Thiel and thinks that Peter Thiel has a bunch of good ideas um so for example one idea of what one thing he I remember him saying was um Peter Thiel says the best startups have one source of Revenue uh not eight sources of revenue I'm sure you've seen this in startup pitch decks where they're like we're going to generate revenue from ads plus we're going to generate revenue from businesses plus we're going to generate revenue from these customers um to having like eight different revenue streams is much worse than we're Facebook we're going to generate revenue from ads one single clear Revenue Source in the beginning and and do you think that I mean I don't think he's the bad guy in the situation because basically what happened with him was uh it'd be like if I'm just a normal person went to the bank account and they tried or the ATM they try to withdraw money and the ATMs glitching and they're like this doesn't feel right hey family uh I think you should bounce and go get your money out of this this is like glitching this does not look good because I believe Peter Thiel he did a CAT I think Silicon Valley invested in Founders fund or something like that uh is that the story or he did some type of capital call uh and Silicon Valley could didn't pay up right away is is that right uh I didn't say anything about that um and uh yeah I don't know what that is what I know is that he basically Peter Thiel was the was one of the people in Silicon Valley that was like this is not good everybody take your money out and then you know all the other Venture firms heard that and sent emails to their portfolio companies saying the same thing like on Thursday you know I'm an invested in a bunch of venture funds a bunch of them emailed their LPS and said hey this is our exposure to Silicon Valley Bank as a fund we're talking to all the portfolio companies and trying to get them to remove all of their money out of Silicon Valley Bank so really they caused the bank run you're you're an LP in like you're an investor in a bunch of funds uh like maybe what like 15 or so big Venture funds uh yep did they have their money tied up and I'll ask I'll tell you why I think this is something was a little fishy here so on that Thursday or Friday when it was all going down um VCS were simultaneously telling their portfolio companies hey get safe but at the same time we're basically saying hey the FED needs to come in and ensure that all the deposit depositors are going to be made in whole um and they were saying it anytime somebody uses the like what I call like the single mother story it like makes me very suspicious and what I mean by that is they were like you have to do this because jobs are at stake these companies have to make payroll and if they can't make payroll next week you know this is going to cause jobs to be lost and you know who works those jobs single mothers and like they basically was all about payroll small businesses jobs saying all the political like buzzwords to get like Washington to do something because you know nobody wants to go be like hey I'm a venture fund we had 90 million dollars in Silicon Valley Bank because they gave us lines of credit and we were we had to keep our money in there and we're stuck you know we're way above that FDIC limit and if we're not made whole we're we're screwed um was that the case or is that just my conspiracy should I take off the conspiracy hat or or is that do you think was that a part of it yeah I mean I I saw a bunch of videos of David sacks and Jason calcanus and stuff saying that kind of thing I my I'm skeptical that any of that matters I think the way that um Jay Powell and Janet Yellen look at this is uh there is a systemic systemic risk to the banking system so you know taking a step back from Silicon Valley Bank like the met the American Financial system is this amazing black magic that exists and it is a source of tremendous amounts of prosperity in America and in the world like if you go in places like Pakistan where I was born you don't have a um you don't have access to a credit card you don't have a FICO score you don't have uh the ability to go get buy a piece of property and get a 30-year mortgage on it that the government backstops um you are constantly worried about the uh your currency being inflated because you're not sure that um the the government is gonna isn't gonna just print so much money that your rupee that's worth uh 100 rupees is worth yeah your life savings basically disappears because of inflation and you're not worried when a company that's a publicly traded company reports earnings that those are lies in the United States like there is so much stuff that is amazing in America from a financial infrastructure perspective that the rest of the world does not have and the Federal Reserve coming in and bailing out Silicon Valley Bank and doing it without using any taxpayer money making all the depositors whole wiping out all the equity holders wiping out all the unsecured debt holders like that's the right thing and where'd the money come from yeah if it didn't come from taxpayers which is that 25 billion back to that come from and also bailout I don't think it's the right term because they didn't bail out the bank the bank is out of business or or it's dead but they bailed out the depositors right the customers yeah and and you know what people were saying on the internet single mothers yeah yeah because they need that third home in Truckee yeah what people were saying on Twitter which I agree with is that hey when you put money into a bank you're not thinking of this as buying um a risk asset you're just thinking of it as I literally have cash I could store it under the mattress but that would be silly I'm gonna store it with the bank and the bank is going to do a better job of taking care of my money than me by storing it under my mattress and that's an important American value yeah that is a super important American value that is my product that the banks sell yeah it's Safety and Security faith that you are your money is safe and if that product if they if people start to question that product the banking system doesn't work and you're one step everything from people everything's food who cares about this little green piece of paper I don't know if anyone's going to care about this or if this is going to be have any buying power tomorrow right money money also has the same thing where the the only attribute that matters is belief in its value and and banks have the same thing it's belief in the safety there and where'd the money come where'd the money come from though you didn't answer that um yeah the FDIC is basically is funded by other Banks so um think of it as an insurance fund and Banks pay a premium to that fund and the FDIC Insurance Fund has a hundred billion dollars in uh fees that it's collected from Banks and in fact um in the Federal Reserve letter that they printed they released yesterday they said any other fees any other money that we need is going to come from a special assessment of other Banks oh wow so they had this money and they said we're gonna make up to this much available not just the Silicon Valley Bank but any bank that um that needs a loan against their their other like their long-term assets if they have the same kind of duration mismatch where they have yeah they own like they're good for the money they just can't get it out today it's in 30 years they'll have enough money um for sure it's just that today the the value of that mortgage that they owned uh you know had gone down 30 or whatever yeah that's right they said we'll give you a loan against that asset uh in the meantime who are the uh who are the winners here um to me the winners are other Community Banks and other banks that have this problem so yesterday that uh the government announced this new brand new program on like uh one sheet of paper it was like a Google doc I saw it uh yeah yeah it's so funny that they uh released stuff in the way that they do they create a new program called the bank term funding program and that's basically going to prevent the Silicon Valley Bank problem that they had with the long duration bonds so basically Silicon Valley Bank had a 1.8 billion dollar loss because they sold a bunch of luck 10-year duration bonds and uh they have to sell them on for 70 cents on the dollar and what the FED announced is that if you're a bank and you've got a bunch of 10-year paper that's worth 70 cents on the dollar you could get a loan from us for all of it you can get a hundred uh you can get dollar for Dollar Loan so if you've got 98 billion dollars of 10-year paper that's now worth 60 billion dollars we will give you a loan for 90 billion dollars so that you can uh not have this problem yeah you can basically not have liquidity problem and then the other winners were like there's a lot of like startup Banks like Mercury it seems like they were just like crushing it uh I think brex was another one like they're just killing it right well I think the the best thing for them so I think the real winners is First Republic because they would have been wiped out today probably and many others like First Republic so they got you know the bullet just whizzed past their ear and uh you know luckily that was the last bullet and now there's no more bullets coming today and there's 2 000 Community Banks in America and so like all a bunch of those would have had a bank run today or this week if they didn't do what they did Mercury and a bunch of these other startup Banks basically when everyone needed to move out of Silicon Valley Bank it's like who's the fastest what's the next Bank name I know that I can open up an account now um and mercury and others were beneficiaries of that now they got billions of dollars billions and billions of dollars of inflows yesterday or sorry Friday now I think that a lot of that would have skipped town this week so I think they would have been a middleman because who the hell is going to keep their money in a startup Bank um when this is your fear you're not going to keep 10 million dollars or 20 million you might have moved it there just because you needed a quick Safe Haven but you weren't going to move in there you were going to still next week go to Chase or Wells Fargo or whatever and go put the bulk of the money there so now I think they're uh in much better shape because instead of being just a middleman they might keep a lot more of that that depositor uh you know those depository relationships now and is it possible that other than the equity holders and the people directly impacted by this that just like the average American might be impacted positively by this in the next six to 12 months because maybe the FED won't be doing more rate uh increases so then you know maybe you can get a mortgage in for four and a half percent or four percent in six or twelve months because the you know the government is like oh hey we kind of like achieved our mission because these guys screwed up uh like inflation might not be as bad now because of of this big loss is that accurate or is that too much of a reach I personally think that's too much of reach I definitely see people saying that on Twitter and CNBC but I think inflation is uh rampant and is has nothing to do with the Silicon Valley Bank problem and basically in two weeks people will have forgotten Silicon Valley Bank problem and they'll have all they have all their money as of today um so like it's back to businesses as usual and business as usual still has massive inflation and the FED is going to continue to raise rates in my opinion I this showed me how naive I am because I was under the impression that if I kept a bunch of cash in the bank that was me doing the safe thing I wasn't investing this money or trying to get yield on it I was saying look you know I just want to keep this in the bank so that you know just in case and the the 250k FDIC thing was this like idea that existed I had never heard it ever coming to play like in 2008 I was a sophomore in college like I didn't care or no I didn't have a bank account you know like I didn't do anything at that time yeah you thought Lehman Brothers was where you like buy khaki pants like oh you got that new parent leaving exactly it was like are they hosting Thursday this week what's going on so it's like yeah this is kind of my first time for this coming into play did you like because I was like who the hell is going to take if you have five million dollars are you really gonna go open up 20 bank accounts each with a 250k limit like that sounds so inconvenient I think that's what a lot of people do but yeah to be honest does this uh Giannis Greek Freak announced that he has 50 bank accounts at different banks each with up to 250 000 that's how he kind of secures against us well I saw Jared Kushner when he uh when Jared Kushner became whatever his role was in the government what secretary I forget what he was but he uh had a release like his his income and I remember or his his net worth and I remember looking through it all and he had dozens of bank accounts and it just said 250 000 in each account and I was like why and and this is I mean this seems is is this normal and I you know I'm just the only guy who didn't do this I had to try not to go above too much above 250 000 but for my business I did but personally no I try not to go above 250. so you spread it across you know how many accounts exactly then Sam what would that be yeah this is our new way to trick people into telling us they're they're like what they're worth be like you're an FDIC right right yeah I was surprised that Giannis only has 50 Banks I was like no because that story is from his rookie year so he came over from Greece where Greece was like having the banking crisis and yeah and so that was his rookie year that that his he he and his agent did that now he's worth like 200 million dollars there's no way he could be doing that at this point he's got some other you know but rich people have this right like if you're at JP Morgan and you got 20 million plus they'll do an auto like sweep into a bunch of accounts for you I think um I'm not sure exactly how it works but I'm pretty sure there are there are products that exist that will do this they just seem Niche to me and seemed like I don't know a tool for the paranoid it didn't seem like a thing that uh um I needed to worry about personally yeah it's so funny because um my father you know immigrant to the U.S uh always worried about the banking system and the US dollar is always like let's go buy gold bars and bury them under the house uh just so that we know that our money is secured and then he's also like let's go open bank accounts in Swiss banks because those are the safe Banks and they're not going to have this problem um because those also don't do fractional Reserve right like a Swiss bank is I think one for one um they don't they don't keep you know just a fraction of your cash in the bank what's an example of a Swiss bank and how do you I mean I've only seen like Wolf of Wall Street where they like go to Switzerland with like cash in hand is that that's not actually how you do that I mean how do you open a specific I don't even know how you would open a Swiss account um you know I think Credit Suisse is uh actually a Swiss bank but it also has a bunch of um was seen as as dangerous for a while I don't even know the name of a Swiss bank um but I bet you can just open a bank account online and wire the money without having to attach uh cash to Margot Robbie and send her to Switzerland but that would be cool if you could I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is CRM shares its data right application every team can stay aligned no out-of-sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better all right we I think we we did a good job covering the Silicon Valley Bank but surely you actually had a few other things that I thought were interesting one of them being the uh all birds right what a [ __ ] company man they are really it's not working out for them is it yeah all birds is uh in my opinion the ugliest [ __ ] shoe I've ever seen in my life and I remember seeing these um like five to seven years ago in Silicon Valley all the Venture investors that I knew were wearing them around town and I was like you you are ugly your shoe is ugly you're ugly this sucks this is not a good looking shoe and I've heard I saw this tweet that I think is the best way to describe it all birds socially acceptable sweatpants for your feet yeah I'm not a big fan of them either but basically they've raised uh two or three hundred million dollars in in funding they've done 300 million dollars in Revenue market cap is uh down from 4 billion to 200 million is that right it's 200 million right now yep yeah down 95 from their IPO in November of 2021. how much of the founders do you think how much they own um I didn't look at how much the founders owned I bet they owned a lot of it before uh when it went public and I didn't look at you know kind of how much have they sold off but I got a decent amount so what's gonna happen with that um so I think that uh you know the the problem that they've been having is that their revenue is shrinking um and their costs are really high they've opened up a ton of stores like 58 stores in the US and abroad and I think that store strategy isn't working because not enough people know what all birds are and walk into the stores and want some um so they've they decide they're going to stop opening stores they're only going to open three more stores this year and those are places where they've already signed leases they're going to stop any International growth by they're not going to open any more international stores they're gonna uh just do just fine Distributors internationally to try to grow they're trying to contain costs by their manufactured today in New Zealand they're going to stop manufacturing them in New Zealand and move it to one place in Vietnam um so you know my sense of what's going to happen to all birds is uh there's somebody we're here to bring your own laces from now on like they're like cutting every corner here there's like you know we don't have running water in the office today uh we're doing that every every other day and until this thing is profitable silly what do you think of this in terms of like d to C so like I think people have basically I think DDC got hot people started a bunch of Brands a bunch of investors came in and funded these companies like they were tech companies but they weren't tech companies Casper um all birds and then some like Warby Parker and others that that got BR that broke out and then you know so on one hand if I if that's all I knew if I was just sitting from afar I would have been like this space doesn't make sense then and now it's playing out where it's like yeah these companies are not profitable they're not doing that well um you know I think they're burning 100 million dollars a year or something like that like they're just they're very mature companies that are still losing a ton of money and I would have just my opinion would have just been that but you and your brother like your brother built native deodorant um it was a profit you know basically raised almost no money uh what did he raise like 500 grand for that business is that is that all he ever like 500 000 yep raised 500 000 built it up basically by himself with like you know a very very small lean team you know packing deodorant like you know at their kitchen table at your kitchen table in your apartment and sold that thing for 100 million dollars when it was highly profitable um that whole way you know then you have that model and you've had a you know you we don't talk too much about your business but you've been involved in a very different style of d2c that is highly profitable lean and mean raise zero capital or very minimal capital and I feel like nobody even knows about those businesses those are like you know more under the radar everybody only hears about the big VC ones uh you know like away luggage and stuff like that what what is your take are you sort of like that other way is dumb or are they actually just two different games and you know both both are valid yeah I think there are two different games the native Playbook of Rey's little Capital um focus on profitability acquired customers uh so that your break even on the first purchase of profitable on the first purchase and uh scale through repeat purchases that are generating a ton of profit using that to either reinvest in the business to launch new products or just take distributions um so I think that's a super valid Playbook and I think there is a valid approach to the raise a bunch of venture capital and try to build um a business at a much larger scale um who's doing that that you think that they have a good shot yeah maybe um yeah figs in my opinion is a great example because uh they're like one of the problems with all birds is they're a fashion brand and at some point the World Turns against you and um like I believe that all birds are ugly I think other people are gonna arrive at a similar conclusion at some point and then all birds is gonna have to find the next style to get to that place uh to to kind of continue to succeed um figs is basically a uniform so uh it doesn't need to be better looking over time yeah but that's a bullsh I think you're wrong there I think that I think that that strategy is not bad like look at Louis Vuitton you know they've been around for 300 years and it's always been cool I think that their execution they just picked a lame thing yeah I don't think I don't think it's a bad strategy I think they just it's a stupid shoe or at least that's what that's what a lot of people think yeah I mean Nike is a great example of a business that um has scaled to you know more than a a hundred billion market cap I want to say and uh they're a fashion brand that serves um you know the super high end as well as the low end um so that they figure out how to do it so I think there is a Playbook to go raise Venture money um or private Equity money and get to scale um I just think a lot of the of the companies that have raised money have been undisciplined they've hired too many people like Grove collaborative um what do they do Grove collaborative is a San francisco-based startup that's 10 years old it's also publicly traded they started out being this Marketplace of kind of natural products so I've saw them as um I would see ads for them saying get free Mrs Meyers uh kit and I would click on those ads because I was like free stuff sign me up and they're basically trying to give you um get you involved in a get you enrolled in a subscription of buying a bunch of Home Products got it okay cool idea cool idea yeah great idea and it went public through us back and it has the same problem as all birds and Away luggage although way is private um growth collaborative stock is down 96 percent and has a market cap of 70 million dollars it's worth uh you know way less than the cash that they've raised that's crazy yeah and the stock is sub one dollars if they have to do a reverse stock split to avoid being delisted and uh yeah they basically have to fire a bunch of people and uh stop spending as much money on marketing so that they can be profitable and have they basically have to accept declining Revenue to get to profitability and uh that's what growth collaborative just did in the third quarter of last year it was their first profitable quarter ever so what companies do you like they're saying all the companies you hey on here you have wish you have Grove you've talked about all birds uh you don't like box yeah which is like Costco online yeah what do you like um I think there's a bunch of companies that are uh awesome businesses that are worth less than they were in March of 2020 um so they're trading at less than pre-covered valuations and I love those companies but uh some of them are the ones you hear about all the time which is uh Facebook Amazon I think those are two great businesses you and I were walking in in SoHo in New York and after some Meetup and I uh I won't say the amount you can say the amount if you want but you said I just bought blank amount of stock in Squarespace and my jaw like kind of dropped I was like what did you really why and you like told me how much you love that company and it was a very large amount um and so are you still at the Squarespace uh yeah I bought a million dollars of Squarespace stock I still own it I don't know if I made any money on it I at some point it turned into like 250 000 because uh Squarespace stock went down so I'd lost 750 000 but I think it has since turned around um you know it's up 15 year-to-date um I think Squarespace is super undervalued as a business but I'm not sure it's a great stock to buy uh you have like a long history with Squarespace let me ask you a different different question um at one point you tweeted out something like hey if we you know if a guy happened to have 50 million liquid and wanted to double it um you know what's your best idea and you got like a hundred replies I remember going through them and being pretty unimpressed with most of the ideas it didn't seem like I I thought you know you some some great stuff would come out of there but but maybe in something like this 100 people reply and it's really three interesting ideas did you get anything interesting or what did people say when you tweeted that out and did you get any interesting ideas on what to do with your money from that um I got one interesting idea which was uh try to go buy all of wish or you know 51 of wish um wish has 700 million dollars in cash and its market cap is 286 million so it's trading at less than cash um so you know buy enough stock that you can uh convince management to distribute the stock distribute the cash and shut the company down right and can you and I remember seeing that uh why doesn't that happen in practice right companies got 700 million in cash it's trading at 300 million uh why doesn't you know it seems like the the the the like the video game move is you buy the 300 million dollar company you shut it down tomorrow so it stops burning cash and you distribute 700 million out you profited 400 million why doesn't that happen in practice or does it happen in practice uh so there are people like Bill Ackman Carl Icahn that are activist investors that do this kind of thing um you know they do it with apple even uh Netflix like call icon uh will basically go by five percent of a company and then call up management and say hey we want you to do X Y and Z and if you don't we're gonna just keep being a thorn in your side um and so and we're going to try to remove your board directors and put our board directors in uh we're gonna threaten to fire youseo they do a bunch of this kind of stuff um and generally what will happen is the CEOs will just listen to Carl Icahn and do what he says or do something else that makes their stock price go up 10 15 20 percent that um and then Carl Icahn will sell his position make billions of dollars and be like great that was fun um with something like wish uh it's if you try to go buy a wish stock it's so thinly traded that you would basically Drive the price up and you would never be able to buy 51 you'd have to you'd have to pay you know 100 700 million 800 million dollar market cap to basically own 51 of it dude it seems like most of the companies that you've mentioned or a lot many of the companies you mentioned went public via SPAC has there been once back that has worked out uh that is a great question I have no idea and for the like I remember chamoth was all about spec I don't pay attention to the public market so I'm a little I'm definitely out of my depth here but I know enough to know that he was big on specs what are these guys what's their reputation right now which is they got and did they make money they made money at going up making it happen and so now are they just like oh [ __ ] y'all like you know what I mean like are they just like uh they don't care yeah the way this backs work is if you're the sponsor which is what your mouth was and a bunch of these like he took Open Door public um through SPAC uh Sofi public thrifts back you end up getting a percentage of the company without taking any real risk um so chamath has made out like a bandit in I think he's done five to ten spacks he's made money in each one of those specs and I think every uh how much um more than a billion dollars across all of those for sure wow and so how does the math work so I remember I think I'd heard one point you have to put up three percent of the capital to own but you own 20 of the company when it goes public is that right or did I did I misunderstand um yeah I don't remember the math but it's something along those lines which is for taking the company public you get um it's probably not 17 but you get something like five percent or ten percent of the company's stock for basically taking it public and you don't take any risk you basically raise money from a bunch of Institutions um you hold that money for up to 18 months you have 18 months to find a Target that you want to take public you find a Target you make a deal with them to take them public um all those investors that have gave you money 18 months ago they can either keep their money in the deal or uh sell it and get their ten dollars back um and so a bunch of people will sell because they're like oh this isn't going to work sell I want to sell my stock so oftentimes um the SPAC which is publicly traded will be trading at ten dollars and then it'll get and the target will get announced we're gonna um take uh Grove collaborative public and then the stock will drop immediately when uh the target gets announced because everyone is selling and it's like oh this isn't gonna this isn't a good Target so what's his reputation then I mean is or is he just like so I mean so original give a [ __ ] about his reputation well did you did you guys say the thing that's on this dock which was uh the reverse Robin Hood steal from the poor and give to make himself Rich no no yeah I was waiting for you because I know I don't I mean I don't know enough to know about him and Michael schnick but Sean you have a strong opinion about it uh I mean I want to hear Stewie's opinion I don't think I have a that strong opinion yeah you give them a hard time dude you give them a really hard time you know I think chimath is super smart super successful I love his uh you know those cashmere sweaters that he wears on all in podcast they look dope I gotta buy me some um but what he's done with the spax is literally the opposite of Robin Hood he's stolen from the poor and given to himself and uh I'm surprised that his reputation is not tarnished in the public markets or in what is it can you ask your question is it that he ended up you know dumping on retail because it was always designed it was kind of designed that way it was gonna be that way or oh well the Market's just turned and everything's down you know like I I don't fault Jeff Bezos because my Amazon stock is down you know like that's out of their control it's a good business blah blah blah versus no the way these were set up it was a bit of a house of cards you know um he was gonna make money and at some point this was going to happen because these fundamentally didn't make sense which one which one is it more yeah you're asking is the what's the intention yeah do you think do you think he knew and that the intention was yeah this is probably how it's gonna play out but let's just see um to me these are pump and dump schemes uh like in Wolf of Wall Street if the company is sound and uh gonna go public generally the companies will go public on their own uh using the traditional IPO path or a direct listing um you know that's what Squarespace Spotify slack all these companies that went public during the same era that he was doing these specs the companies that go public through specs are trying to rush to get public and it's not the airbnbs of the world it's the Grove collaboratives of the world and so fives of the world that are doing it um businesses that that are not as sound now what they would say was like the very first one I think he did was virgin and it was look this is a company that you'd have to be a rule like you know Tech investor to understand it's got a really long-term huge vision and you know they needed somebody who believed and they didn't want to you know take their chances with the with the short-term minded stock you know uh you know IPO stock market so some version of that was like you had to be a True Believer in Technology Innovation and you had to be smart enough to understand how big this business could be that's why I'm taking it public and so it kind of made sense on the first one and then pretty soon it was like just putting lipstick on the pig and selling it and that's how it felt to me at least and so I'm kind of of the same opinion which is I think obviously he's smart and obviously he's successful I don't think those are arguable I think that uh he's also very pompous you know I don't love his personality I also think that what he did with the specs I think you know uh seems to be more like like more like the pump and dub or uh putting lipstick on a pig like you know these weren't great businesses it was what can I do to just you know to get something to to cash here um because he again he had a free role in a lot of these exactly and so you know and I and I find him to be you know somewhat disingenuous when he when he talks like you know I remember before he took Metro mile public it was uh Buffett had Geico I have Metro Mile and here's why it's better blah blah blah fast forward like less than a year at Metro mile is you know sold for 30 cents on the dollar to Lemonade um because it was whatever not in good shape at that time um and then you know no mention of it ever again you know it's like oh yeah on to the next yeah the the thing um you know there's a bunch of people that were uh pumping Bitcoin or other crypto products and when they tweet there's a ton of people that reply to their tweets saying [ __ ] you I lost my life savings because of your um because I took your financial advice when chamath tweets I look to see what the responses are there aren't many people that are like hey you screwed uh all the you know the public moms and single moms and uh families on uh on these specs dude I was with your brother one time silly and we were hanging out and someone was talking about a get rich quick scheme and how like uh I think I someone they were like saying like uh you know no no one likes to quit get rich quick scheme and your brother goes uh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa getting rich quick is the best way to get rich and uh and your brother's pretty funny because sometimes he'll say funny stuff but it's like oh yeah you're right that is like that's way better and Sean was talking about chamoth and virgin he's like you know we don't care about the short term it's for the long term and a lot of times when I when I read about this these uh public markets and they talk about long term I'm like yeah I think you're I I kind of care about the short term I definitely care about the short term a bit too uh so and and they like use that word long term to uh disguise like bad [ __ ] like you know it's about the long term it's not about the short term just hold it's the long term I'm like I don't know getting rich quick and in a short amount of time that's that sounds nice too uh I would like it not to fail in the short term uh that would be nice there there's this Warren Buffett quote where uh somebody is like some reporter is like hey what you talk about is pretty um simple and sounds like anyone can do it uh why aren't more people applying the Warren Buffett strategy and and becoming billionaires and his response was everyone wants to get rich quickly I'm about getting rich slowly and nobody has the patience to do it yeah but here's my issue with that when he talks about that he keeps talking about the long term and he's 95. uh it's like bro there there ain't a long term have some fun yeah you don't have long term anymore stop talking about long term maybe long term stops when you're 60. it's like enjoy it yeah I was talking to these um 25 year olds and I was like two million dollars when you're 25 is more valuable than 20 million dollars when you're 45. because you can basically do awesome stuff at 25 that you're not going to be able to do at 45. yeah dude I agree I agree um Sean what are you gonna say I was gonna say uh you had shared this blog post about a good a good quest which is uh I think a guy from Founders fun I think wrote it a while a while back I remember reading at me like this is actually pretty interesting um seem like something that maybe maybe resonated with you can you explain the idea of a good Quest and then I want to hear you guys uh talk about it um yeah it's kind of like this guy basically was like um some guy found responders Stevens I think um he was basically like a bunch of the brightest Minds in Silicon Valley and in America and in the world are uh focused on bad quests so kind of in a game you can uh in the game of life you're either focused on something that is noble and honorable and makes the world a better place or in his language you're focused on um short-term things that are going to make you rich quickly uh even if they're incremental improvements um so a slightly better mouse trap and he basically is like there is no uh we're wasting society and um people are wasting their energy brilliant people are wasting their Brilliance on dumb problems and we should be trying to solve the greatest problems that we have in our lifetimes and that is the noble work and everything else is [ __ ] and he points out he's like most I don't know man but this guy look but do our Pro his former job he he used to work at Mike's Hard Lemonade I don't know if I can trust this guy did you really that's how he knows dude that's the experience he did the total opposite he works at Andrew a defense company but like I don't know I prefer Nerf like sorry go ahead I'm an idiot yeah he's a co-founder of mandrel so he points out this thing which is like you know the average person is not capable of going on one of these good quests so if you're brilliant if you really are in that kind of like top one percent of talent uh and motivation and ability it's kind of like your moral imperative like you you kind of got to be the ones doing this because who else if not you then who um is sort of the the mindset that he has um and so I would say that like you know I think you're awesome but you you yourself are like I want to go in a good question you've been telling me this for like five years yes and you're like I've spent my whole life building these like mouse traps that make a bunch of money because I just wait for them I just see them they're obvious this widget I could sell this widget and make a bunch of money um and you've done that are you did this blog post tip you over the edge to do a good Quest or did it have the opposite effect and turn you off and say actually you know F this guy and F this whole like noble Quest [ __ ] maybe next week [Laughter] um you know I went to this uh SV Angel Event in San Francisco last week um and I'd been to San Francisco in a really long time because I was having this like existential question myself of uh should I be going on good and hard quests versus easy quests um and you know easy quests are great because you have a great quality of life like uh you don't work that hard um you can go play tennis in the middle of the day or work out at noon like my brother every day at noon will go work out for two hours in the middle of the day um we could have a sick pad in in New York and maybe a place in La and and travel all over the place I mean you guys have a pretty nice life yeah yeah like he's gonna go to Japan uh next week um just for fun to look at uh go to the Cherry Blossom Festival um so you know he's uh it's very easy to be seduced by like quality of life and easy quests in my opinion I like how you're using your brother here instead of yourself you do all the same things you're just like yeah using him as like this guy it's way easier to use him uh than kind of look at the mirror look in the mirror more closely um and so you know I went to that event and uh Sam Altman spoke and he was basically like um everyone thinks open AIS and overnight success I've been working on this for seven years God damn it and so have all of these other AI um scientists and AI engineers and it took us seven years to make chat GPT what it is today that's not that long it's not that long but uh it's it's a really long time like basically they didn't launch a product for maybe five years or something along those lines um and you know he had every Quest at his disposal he could have just simply sat back and Angel invested and done you know become you know as proficient at pickleball as one can be right like he had he was running YC at the time and he left probably you know the the best job in Silicon Valley which is running YC yeah probably the highest paid lowest effort job you could have like it's up to you how hard you want to work there but exposure to new people new entrepreneurs new ideas you get to do all the fun [ __ ] you get to see all the smartest people you get to be the king maker uh you know you have the infinite money glitch if you're her if you're doing everyone in Silicon Valley is coming to kiss your ring hey quick to go do this non-profit AI thing and I remember at the time I remember literally at the time this was like what did he do this like 2016 or 2019 or something like that he he left he had been funding it as his own like you know personal passion project basically until then that he left YC to do that and I remember thinking at the time I should probably just go follow Sam Altman like if he is gonna do this with his time there's really no better signal in the world that that's this is like the right place to be unfortunately I didn't act on that but I remember having that thought in back in you know 2018 2019. yeah it's it's funny to me that you say that like seven years is not a long time um because yeah I guess in a sense it's not but um seven years at the same time seems like Infinity um when you're working on uh a startup and you're there's no immediate gratification like I can't think of the last time I was able to work on something for seven years without some form of immediate gratification I mean there was there was there was Milestones uh look at this guy the did Trey Stevens who started Android like funding rounds winning certain contracts some type of press I mean that's like pretty cool you know there you got you can get yourself you can get your dopamine hit but what are you gonna do are you gonna quit doing this small boy [ __ ] that makes a lot of money you're gonna start doing something like legitimate that like actually matches your IQ um yeah I want to try and do a hard Quest but what what's what's the what are the handful of ideas or industries that uh tickle your fancy and then doing something in healthcare would be really amazing and transformative um I I think healthcare in America is so bad uh it's shocking to me like um you know my mom had a bunch of medical problems last year and just getting access to doctors uh is insane um like if you want to get see a specialist you have to wait 60 or 90 days to go see a specialist specialized doctor and um a friend of mine who's a doctor was like here's how you solve this here's the concierge uh medicine practice you give them 30 000 a year yeah I had one it was 25 Grand a year yeah you pay them 25 Grand 30 grand a year or whatever it is and all they do is they are able to get you appointments faster because they're able to text the doctors because they know the doctors personally because they used to work with them and say hey can you do me a favor I'll see my guy uh next week instead of three months from now um it's kind of like gangster a little bit like it's like uh it's like the doctors are it's run by the streets you know what I mean it is pretty weird it's not cool yeah it's not cool it's broken and then the other really [ __ ] up thing is um if you have a medical problem and a neurologist will be like this is a cardiac cardiologist problem and the cardiologist will be like this is a neurologist problem and the two of them are like Superman and Clark Kent which is they're never in the same room at the same [ __ ] time so you can't actually get real information about what the problem is and they never talk to each other they talk to each other through like handwritten notes uh in the dark of night do you have a tangible idea on this or you're just like healthcare it's like healthcare is just too big of a word doesn't mean anything yeah it is too big of a word one idea that I've been taking around with is um like remote monitoring of patients so uh you know my mom um lives in Dallas um sometimes there sometimes traveling and um I want to have some device that she has that is like monitoring her blood pressure [Music] um her blood sugar her heart rate and uh reporting that to me and to all these other doctors in um you know real time so that if there's a problem you know it faster and so that you can go track this stuff right now when you go to the doctor and if you have blood sugar problems or um high blood pressure problems they're like what was your blood pressure last week versus what is it right now what was your blood sugar last week versus what it is right now that it's always reported uh yeah it's always wrong yeah it's self-reported and um it's just so broken and I think being able to track this stuff in a more automated seamless seamless way device yeah like I got a whoop and uh you know that's doing some extra tracking but yeah some kind of embedded device that's like continuous glucose monitor plus um some way to measure your blood pressure and uh kind of keep in one one place um the other thing that I think is a really interesting idea is that I went to Georgia Tech in 2003 and at the time they were working on building a smart home and one of the ideas they had for a smart home was a smart toilet so imagine when you're using the toilet every time you use the toilet it texts you and says dude uh you're eating too many French fries right stop dual sample basically yeah stool and urine sample and uh are measuring in real time what's up wasn't there a company that was doing that in San Francisco that was totally a fraud was it you biome is that what they were doing it wasn't a smart toilet though I think you had to send it to them uh okay wow [ __ ] that that's that's kind of weird right I can't even how do you get a well I don't know but uh no those are interesting I've seen people like tinkering around with this idea I do think it's very fascinating I have no idea how you do it what do you [ __ ] a net and it like takes a little strain uh I don't know I don't know what the mechanics are but I think it's an interesting idea that like let's put it let me ask you a different way I think you have a very good way of thinking about problems and what I mean by that is um every time I've come to you with an idea like two things happen that that are different with you than with most people one is you're like I'm not you don't sit there and ask like uh is this feasible or how would we do it you know like that question comes later it's like first let me decide on like the big idea and you know how how could you know would this be amazing if it happened okay then I'll go find a way to make it happen or like you know your brother when he started the deodorant company I remember somebody was like boys do you know anything about deodorant he's like no I know nothing about deodorant but in six months I don't know everything there is to know about deodorant and sure enough you know built a very big dinner man so like the kind of like not being limited by what I know today is like you know I would say one factor and the other is like um you're not one at least from what I could tell like you don't really consider like plan B's or like if this fails or why would this fail uh you I remember when we started a thing together you were like yeah I just I was trying to do that and you were like I don't know man I don't really think that way I just sort of uh I decide to win and then I do it and I just plan to win and I don't really focus on the rest am I am I correctly understanding that or no um yeah I think I think starting with um starting with is if can this work and uh or like you know what are so many people when they're evaluating an idea uh immediately are like no this is not gonna work for reason X Y and Z actually my brother is like this um and so I hate talking to him about new ideas because he's always just like [ __ ] on them he's just kind of a skeptic by Nature um so I definitely start with the uh if this works uh what does the world look like and uh uh can this be a big deal if it actually works um so when I think about the smart toilet I'm like cool uh right now to figure out if you have colon cancer they do uh you have to poop in an envelope and send it to a lab um what happens if this is automated um right now uh like there's all these medical things that I should probably be doing differently I just have no idea what they are and even if I knew them I didn't I don't have a good way to like have somebody enforce it in a automated way um if that happened across America we could solve diabetes because oftentimes diabetes is a disease that you choose instead of a disease that um you're forced with um so yeah definitely start with the if this works is it going to be a big deal and then um then I'm kind of like cool could I get customers for this and if I could then I'm kind of like that's all you really need to start you don't really need an any more information about like how to build a toilet or um any of the science like I think you can figure that out later but can this be big would this be big if it worked and can I get customers yeah yeah those are the two and often what you know one thing that happens I look at a lot of startup like investment deals with sui and uh it'll be like here's these great people there's this great technology great product blah blah and he'll just be like cool so how are you gonna get customers and like you you'd think like this like appears to be like a baffling question to so many Founders or they'll say something and he'll be like okay so what do you mean so what do you mean like what are you where are you gonna go or like you know have you done that um tell me about three times in your life that you've done that and uh and then he's sort of like you know I'm in or out based on their ability to get customers and I think yeah it's like the I told you that my meme of the year is that midwit Meme it's like the genius and the idiot the way they think it's aligned and the analyzer who's taking into account 75 variables actually ends up with the wrong answer more often than not and like this idea of like can it be you know if it worked would it be big and can I get customers is the sort of the midwit meme like you know in real life yeah I don't think you need to know more than that in fact um Sam and I were on this call where this guy was pitching uh I think it's the company was called Firefly it was pitching um ads on top of Ubers and taxi cabs in uh like this physical device that was on top of the and they're around now but I think at the time he wanted a hundred million dollar or maybe 60 million dollar valuation and uh it was crazy I remember being off that call and I was like huh yeah Sam messaged me and was like this is bananas can you believe this guy uh this guy's valuation and the audacity um and he was uh I think at the time losing money um on each individual device for years um so yeah there are there are often times where people I I'm shocked by how many people are like cool I figured out what the product is but I have no idea how to get customers I have no idea what the economics of that looked like and that's where companies go to die um how'd that company end up by the way did it did it do it it still exists but I have no idea got it um I'm drinking the water this water here this is a 25 bottle of water because it's like pure water that's been filtered um it I'm in LA right now it turns out that if you drink tap water in La supposedly according to this guy it has Pharmaceuticals in the water without Irwin or something yeah I think this instrument one and uh this water is basically uh pure in a way that like you can't get water anywhere else these days and so it costs 25 a bottle this is insane and it tastes just like water and you're pointing it so it's a yeah so you know super interesting idea um I I didn't talk to this guy or anything but um I wonder what their distribution strategy is uh because I think putting 25 water at irwan or Whole Foods is like an inadequate distribution strategy to get the meaningful skill for this well I'll give you the counter example I was doing some research on the milk boys um who and I won't do the full thing about the novel Boys in their kind of business Empire but one thing that stood out was I was watching this clip and it was John Shahidi who you guys might know because he's like kind of came he was like in Silicon Valley then he transitioned into like Hollywood influencer stuff when he had his like mobile app shots get popular from like a bunch of fine stars is John their manager and he's now their manager so like shots didn't work out he didn't build the next Snapchat uh even though he had every influencer and Justin Bieber and Floyd Mayweather and like all these people using it and investing in him but he was like cool I can help these influencers out so he started managing influencers and now he just is the manager of the note boys and they were like so they're there's hard Seltzer brand happy Dad which is basically like it looks literally like a Bud Light uh like just like it looks like the right product it's towards the right market and um they value the company I think at 250 million dollars right now they're doing like I forgot how much uh exactly I'll pull it up it's getting close to 100 million in Revenue yeah it's close to 100 million in Revenue so somewhere between 50 and 100 million in Revenue uh so the brand is doing really well and it's very young it's like it's like a very new um brand but um they were like oh so for happy Dad like you know what's what's the next product are you coming out with a new flavor or like a hard alcohol like what do you get to do because no we have basically Futsal we've done all the hard work to get foot soldiers to get into gas stations 7-Elevens and whatever and so rather than compete with ourselves and like the fiercest competition in the drink Market in those we just looked around the store we just sent people into the stores that were like doing these like gas station sales for us and they looked around and were like what's the easiest category we can win and they're like so we're doing uh beef jerky they're like beef jerky is like a really stale category we already have this distribution channel into these uh gas stations and stuff in convenience stores like hundreds if not thousands of these stores across the country that is The Edge all we have to do is work backwards from that like we have the we have the front end sales now we just need to figure out the back end product that should go into that into that sales Channel and when I hear that I'm like the milk boys run a more sophisticated business operation than like 95 of Silicon Valley in just that one way of thinking yeah it's amazing um yeah there's this Justin Quan Khan quote uh first-time Founders are obsessed with products second time Founders are obsessed with distribution now I think there's this uh concept of um I just focused on distribution the product comes after I have distribution yeah that's what like what we did with the audience right it's like cool I'm gonna build up a big podcast we didn't sort of intentionally go about it this way we just wanted to do a podcast but once you realize oh cool I could just build up a huge audience I can come up with great products after uh I don't even need to like know what product it would be going in yeah I didn't understand that with the hustle I was like why are you guys investing and they're like because building an audience is really hard and I was like that's not that hard to just do this this beep up Boop and you got it and then I kind of later on I realized that to build an audience that's engaged it's kind of it is a little formulaic but it's also a lot of luck and kind of catching lightning in a bottle where and then once you have it it's uh very very very very valuable now that I don't have it anymore I'm like ah I get it that was hard yeah it's amazing to see people all around uh the world doing this now and all these verticals like you know Doug demuro um did this then uh got an audience then started cars and bids dude that was early on Sean I was telling you Doug tomorrow that that car's in Biz it's gonna be big now his competitor was just in the New York Times last week for selling a billion dollars with the cars congrats on uh investing on that when you called it yeah yeah about that yeah did you try to invest in Doug Demarest thing uh maybe like a DM on Twitter was about the extent of it uh but oh so no it was most I just it was I talked the talk I didn't walk the walk and also I didn't have a lot of money at the time I think he it's it's about four years old but no I I I talk to talk that's about all I did it's also amazing because uh these guys will um are often bootstrapped right because they basically start with no audience they just start making an audience and then uh once they have an audience they're generating so much profit from the audience through YouTube videos or whatever uh so they don't even need outside Capital so I think even if you chase them down he might have been like I'm already making money I don't need to raise money um so it just turns a lot of Silicon Valley stuff upside down of like you know distribution first that generates profit then you use that profit to um make product silly did you look at the feedback from your last episode people loved you they like your voice they say that you're calming and I agree right all right I uh I only listen to feedback that like Sean or Ben Levy texted me you had very positive feedback people liked you they said that you're calming that they would do anything that you'd say things like that very it got a little weird yeah thanks for doing this people thanks for doing this hopefully uh people enjoyed the uh Silicon Valley Bank breakdown and a few other things and uh if you made it this far we're doing a meet up actually Sean tomorrow you're not going to make it we had we have it like sold out like right away 500 people but uh we'll be doing another one April 28th ish and we'll announce that more info on that soon yeah I got one quick thing I want to plug which is um you know Sean has this guy who's his right hand guy who helped him on all these different projects uh I want to find a right-hand guy to help me with a bunch of projects so like source and diligence Investments um of research random business ideas I have come work for me full time for the next five or ten years and let's go do something amazing and what do they find you you can find me on Twitter DM me all right and is your hand what's your handle it's s-u-l-i it's my full name s-u-l-e-m-a-n-a-l-i all right that's good you're one of the very few people that has taken advantage of this to actually promote something but you did it at the end you could have done in the beginning but that's all right [ __ ] it only the strong made it here that's what he filtered about that's right he filtered out the week the week people all right we're out of here that's the pot cool [Music]

anytime a rich person tells you that money doesn't make you happy just ask them for their money then like cool cool cool I guess it's useless right can I just give me a bunch of it then all right [Music] fellas welcome to the Friday episode The Boys reactor and go through some news stories uh let's start with the thing that everyone is talking about everyone is always talking about which is Elon Elon has gotten himself in trouble a couple times this week first he tried selling some house plants or office plants I should say uh to his employees to raise money wait really and then also uh ridiculed and sort of kind of fired an employee who uh who is disabled uh your thoughts on the endless drama of you on cringe what do you think yeah Elon is is the cringe Master he has to make everything about him uh like it's just me me he's now known as milon musk in my house this guy this guy's too much the the crazy thing Sam did you watch this all go down with the the guy that was like hey am I fired I think we should we should explain this yeah so do a recap I I didn't understand all that at first I had to like click so guy goes on Twitter uh who's got I never heard of this guy but he's got like 150 000 followers and he says Hey nine days ago I lost access to my work computer just can't I can't access Twitter anymore I work at Twitter I can't access my work my work computer doesn't log in anymore it doesn't work can't get into my email can't do anything um I'm not sure if I'm fired nobody told me I'm fired but I just can't get into my email or my computer I've emailed them I've waited nine days I've got no reply from HR from my you know from anybody um so I'm guessing hey at Elon Musk am I fired and so the you know he tweets that out was he getting paid still I don't I don't know I don't think so because everybody was whatever it was only nine days so maybe it was he hadn't got it got in between yet so he tweets that out and he goes maybe if this gets enough retweets then um you know then I'll get a response so it gets retweeted a bunch of like because people you know there's the whole uh group of people that you know love to hate Elon myself included and so people are like this is another example of you know how poorly Twitter's being run right now like why why would you if you're gonna fire somebody tell them they're fired that's you know common decency right like I feel like elon's got this flow chart where it's like I'm firing this person should I tell them it's like yes and it's like no no I'm gonna go with no okay what happens after no like should I just should I um you know you know meet with them in person it's like uh dude he's like Irish good buying their jobs it's basically it's just walking out without saying exactly and so anyways this thing gets um this thing goes viral so basically uh Elon then you know again he sees all he sees this thing going viral so instead of um instead of uh instead of actually just eBay you are fired or confirmed yes you you were you were fired he instead says um what have you been working on like what have you accomplished is the uh so then he goes well if I you know if I say what I'm working on I think I'd be breaking my NDA do I have permission to break my NDA and tell you what like can I say publicly here what I work on anyone replies yes go ahead so dude what a pathetic start to the story that's already pathetic he goes all right well the guy goes well I was you know leveling up the design of this I was working on this and um you know I was helping save money on this contract or whatever and um and he goes Elon replies level up the design from what to what you know pictures or it didn't happen and like yo [ __ ] you cut off his computer access how is he supposed to have screenshots of his work if you took away his computer he's not even able to do it and um and then he's like mocking him basically he's just replying with like the crying laughing emoji he's replying trolling him with like a clip from Office Space and now here's where Elon went wrong so elon's not dumb but he's a dumbass and there's a big difference between dumb and a dumbass dumb is you're just not smart dumbasses you're smart but you do dumb things and that's what Elon does here so he basically picks on a guy that it comes out so this guy sold his company to Twitter and the guy so Elon comes out and he hears what he says about the guy he goes he goes somebody was like dude this is the uh this guy Alex Cohen had this great tweet he goes I'm not gonna lie this is the most entertaining exit interview ever because watching this whole thing go down in public and then the guy and Elon says the reality is this is a guy that who was independently wealthy did no actual work and claimed as an excuse that he has a disability preventing him from typing yet here he is tweeting out tweeting up a storm wait so and so the disability thing Elon said that first he goes he claimed as his excuse that he has a disability preventing him from typing yet was simultaneously tweeting up a storm I can't say I have a lot of respect for that what a douche why could how could he even feel that here's the other side of the story this guy has like this guy's in a wheelchair he's had like muscles muscular dystrophy for 25 years and so he goes so this guy came back with just kind of some fire so he goes uh Thunderclap I think you call this yeah he did a solo Thunderclap basically so he comes back he goes glad to see you're taking such an interest in my health um I assume what you're talking about when you are sharing my private health information online is the fact that I've had muscular dystrophy for 25 years and I guess I'll go ahead and tell the story now so you know I lost I lost the ability to use my legs 20 years ago I've been in a wheelchair um unfortunately it's been spreading and I've my my arms have been getting weaker over time in fact that's why I sold my company remember you said I was independently wealthy I guess what you mean by that is I built a successful company and sold it unlike you know somebody else who might have inheralded inherited a emerald mine which is you know how elon's dad owned an emerald mine which is [ __ ] which is that's a [ __ ] thing people say but whatever a good step we'll use it in this case it's good um and so he goes I guess that's what you mean by independently wealthy and you know so here's what here's the story this guy's got muscular dystrophy he he's losing feeling and or strength in his arms it's becoming very painful to to type he decides okay I'm gonna sell my company and instead of taking a lump sum payment he chose to get paid out uh through like a salary instead of an upfront money which is like dude who would do that why because he wanted to pay more taxes in Iceland where he's from or I think it's Iceland maybe yeah yeah I think it's nice wait really more taxes why do you want to pay more taxes because he felt like he's as a disabled person he had benefited a lot from like the social welfare system there and was like I want to contribute as much as I can to that which honestly sounds like too good to be true like that's so different than me I almost can't fathom that I'm almost like why don't you just take the money and donate it instead of paying taxes I don't understand that but either way uh this guy so build a company had 100 employees working for him it was profitable it decides to sell it um you know he he's his body's basically been giving out on them he's like you know financially it wasn't the best decision uh my company was making a lot of money Twitter's offer was lower than other companies but I made a bet on Twitter it was growing at the time um and he goes by the way he goes anyways I digress are you still reading or is your bathroom break over okay what was I saying and he goes um hey oh yes uh so you bought the company told employees you weren't firing them firing 75 of them and then you did I was not in the first batch or the second batch or the third batch of layoffs I don't know which batch we're on map now but I you know uh whatever you know I think I got I think I'm fired now I'm not sure I just want to make sure I get paid out because in his contract he had it where okay I'll take the money as a yearly salary rather than an upfront payment but if you ever fire me then you have to pay out the rest right so I'm guaranteed this money I'll take it you know slower rather than faster but you know that that's fine and so anyways this guy this guy not only he not only he says how he's typing what's that he also mentioned how he was typing yeah I think he was just like yeah I can't do like sustain thing but like I can type with one finger on my phone and uh blah blah and so anyways he explains this he goes um like this guy was literally named person of the year in Iceland this guy like his his side hustle is he's building wheelchair ramps throughout Iceland so that other disabled people could he's building hundreds of these wheelchair ramps like that's who you're that's who you're picking on here that's who that's who you chose to to fight with I saw this great quote he goes Elon man this guy's a dumbass he [ __ ] with the wheelchair Mr Rogers and he goes he goes what is this guy thinking uh you know like and so this guy you know I read this thread and I was literally like hmm 911 I'd like to report a murder right like you know it was just like the ultimate clap back and then Elon tries to backtrack and he basically goes um some random dude Tweets in the thread goes I know Hallie and this is you know you're saying that he's a liar and was just trying to do no work and get paid out and that's not who this guy is random guy tweets and then Elon reads back this is the most [ __ ] of all the [ __ ] he goes based on that comment I decided to call Hallie rather than um rather than just tweet it to each other and um he goes I decided to call Hallie uh uh and he goes um what did he say he goes and you know have a video chat with him turns out you know there was a misunderstanding the information I was given was either incorrect or correct but not important that's that white flag bro you you lost you know uh you know we've discussed him you know staying with the company and you know this is the ultimate backtrack it's like first of all you you want him to stay with the company because you have to pay him out if you fire him so that's like you know the first thing second thing you basically [ __ ] up and stepped in it and this guy could sue you for like you know a whole bunch of money for like basically you know discriminating against a disabled person as well as disclosing his private health information as well as probably three or four other you know issues that were that were you know labor laws that were broken in this process but it's like dude you decided to have a video chat not when the guy said he's you know your employee said he hasn't heard from you not when he you know asked one for an explanation um but when a random guy on Twitter said no hell he's a good guy you decided there to stop in your tracks and do a video call with him [ __ ] like this all this whole thing is [ __ ] and Elon continues to be you know king the king of [ __ ] have you heard the uh the song damn it feels good to be a gangster sure you hear that song there's a line there's a line in it I can't say the real line but it basically says uh real gangsters don't flex nuts because real gangsters know they got them and right now elon's he he is pretty gangster I mean he's the man he ain't acting like it he's flexing nuts hard and he shouldn't be flexing as hard as he is and uh I get the personality type where some people are like dude he's just saying whatever he wants the same thing with Trump or he's like he's just saying what he's just like it is says it like it is and I I actually dislike that uh I like that like to an extent but I'm like there's but just because you say it like it like well he's just doing what he wants yeah but he just you just punch someone like hitting people isn't good yeah do you know what I mean it's like yeah I want to do what I want does that mean I want to like go take a dump in the corner of the room like you know there's like do you let's be polite to one another also if possible right we don't we're not going to be needlessly needlessly rude to one another and that's kind of how I feel he acts right now and that's not cool two other two other parts of this new story one it's going around that this guy's payout was 100 million dollars which makes no sense anybody who's in business is like well that number makes no sense there's no way he's getting paid nine million dollars a year of salary there's no way that they bought his Agency for 100 million dollars it's not how much you would Aqua hire an agency for it's probably more like 10. but it'll and I went I found it it just started with some random guy who goes oh man Elon backtracking now because he realized he that Hallie has a 100 million dollar payout and like 5 Tweets in somebody's like where'd you read the 100 million I've never saw that he goes I'm just estimating like you know Aqua hours are a million dollars ahead they had 100 employees so you know 100 million dollars and now that's just like in a bunch of places it's like that's how that's how bad like information spreads how fake News starts the second thing is Elon owned himself when he goes the end of his thing he goes better to talk better to communicate through talking instead of communicating on Twitter it's like just literally [ __ ] on his own platform by the way like you know so so self-owning you know all around um so that I thought that was interesting and then Ben said this other thing about the house the office plant thing what do you make of this I mean this makes no sense what happened I didn't dude I I muted Elon I I love what elon's doing man but I like I even think the Twitter thing's interesting but [ __ ] it's hard to be on his team and so I had to mute him he so he's been selling like office furniture and memorabilia from the office like just liquidating to like get more cash I tried buying they had a Twitter logo I tried buying it but it got up too high and apparently like there was like plants in the office that he tried selling to an engineer like one of the employees or something like that it's like I mean I don't know either this guy's a marketing genius he's trying to get PR like trying to like it's the thing where it's Amazon was like we use doors as desks to save money which is a [ __ ] it's either one of those just like stories that sounds like man he's really turning over every Rock to save money from this this bleeding company by the way I tried doing that an Ikea desk is significantly cheaper than a door from Home Depot exactly I've tried doing this a desk is way cheap doors yeah you can't even like write on them so so I don't know what to make of the story but just sounds like it just makes no sense either he's lost his mind or there's a masterful PR thing that's like 9000 IQ and I can't understand it or someone's just making things up I don't understand uh maybe maybe all I think all of those things could be true an exaggeration about a weird thing he said because he's lost his mind and makes for good PR gotcha that and he's a genius it could be all those things you know he could be he's he's not dumb but he's a dumbass that's a that's a great line I saw people call him Elmo Elmo mosque and I thought that was pretty funny uh but no he's he's [ __ ] up do you want to do one more yeah what else you got all right let's go with uh with money and happiness guys so uh there was a 2010 paper that said that basically above seventy thousand dollars more money does not make you more hap does not make you more happy turns out Mo Money less problems because a new study says that that is completely untrue it starts to flatten a little bit as it goes up but what do you guys think of this I I so here I I'm pulling this up so here's what it says Sean um it says that um so if you are in the happiest of the unhappiest 20 does Plateau after reaching a hundred thousand dollars but after that if you're not in that group more money does mean more happiness and uh and it basically it goes all the way up they studied it all the way up to five hundred thousand dollars and they said after that we we really didn't study it much but up to five hundred thousand dollars people do get happier but that said the researchers found that the overall emotional effect of more money on a person is small compared to other circumstances it's even compared to a weekend approximately a fourfold difference in income so four times your income is equal to the effect of a weekend which is kind of funny wow um but that said more money makes you happy so and this is all like there's this like 2010 study where it said seventy thousand dollars from the beginning I thought that was the most [ __ ] study and I've done this pod so many times that's nonsense that is absolutely not true seventy thousand dollars my sister when she was like younger lived in New York for seventy thousand dollars you're basically below the poverty line that is not happy um so 70 000 not a chance I used to say I thought it was at like 250 I actually believe it could be 500 or even more but you get happier this is one of those things like um you know that might be true I when I heard this study I was like that might be true I'm gonna go ahead and test for myself like I don't know if the Earth is flat around I don't really have the ability to go out there and check it out I don't know you know if uh if sulfur gas is poisonous but I figure yeah no need to test that this is one of those scientific claims that I had just decided a long time ago I'm gonna go ahead and check I'm gonna go ahead and do my own research on this one and uh and go ahead try to go get go get a bunch of money and see how it feels and uh you know what I'm glad I did because the study was [ __ ] dude I got an MRI yesterday and the lady at the front desk was like all right that's 750 and she was like didn't say that she just handed me that she goes there's a bill today and she showed it to me she thought that I was gonna like freak out and I was like all right you take Apple pay and I just scanned my card or whatever and I remember thinking you're like where do I tip I am yeah I remember thinking I am so happy I'm in a spot I used to not be able to afford that at all and I'm so happy I'm in a spot I call that you know what I call that I call that braces money I'm just gonna be able to swipe my card and get my kid braces and not think twice about it when I was younger my parents bought me braces and they told me that it was two grand that they had to pay on a credit card and at the time they had like six thousand dollars and I remember thinking like God damn that sucks right like that's not I would be a lot happier if I had nine million dollars in the bank as opposed to nine thousand dollars or whatever you guys had anytime a rich person tells you that money doesn't make you happy just ask them for their money then like cool cool cool I guess it's useless right can I just give me a bunch of it then right like you know yeah dude and let's let's look at the actions uh versus the words in a lot of these cases right there's I always thought this study was [ __ ] also because I I wonder how much money the people making this study make I was always like yeah that's what they think sure they think that because I want to know how much bias goes into a study when the it's always the researcher's salary well that's that's it yeah or they're like making only 50 and they're like hey C boss 70 000. um but I've always wondered what like the biases are because uh like I don't know I haven't even wondered I'm like this is obvious this is obviously not true and uh you know if I get to the finish line and I realize hey you know 5 million and 10 million felt the same well shame on me for going the extra mile do you know another thing have you ever tried to read a study yeah dude studies are the talks are crazy yes it's hard I have no idea and then I'll like I follow all these like smart like a huberman or like these other guys who like break down studies and I'm like and they'll say like well this study's actually [ __ ] for this reason and I'm like I guess I'll believe you but I don't like I can't read this and they'll like say like studies that I'm like well it said the word study in it it must be true and they're like no no it's actually way off for this reason and like their sample size was like eight people was it colleges or uh you know a bunch of bunch of different things like that dude I don't know how to read anything or there's a chart and it's like the error bars are huge it's like yeah it's that plus or minus you know it's 70 000 plus or minus 500 000 it's like whoa okay hold on what's going on here right so so yeah I think science is uh is used as a like a shield for like you can't argue sometimes um in many cases and there's good science and there's bad science and there's weak science and there's strong science and there's you know and then there's physics where it's like you know empirically true um but the only thing that I know is three things there's good signs there's bad science and I don't know the difference between the two that's like the only that's the only shirt right there nice that's like the only truth that I know it exists I'm just that was a little too big old brain look at that big brain on today all right what else we got got that big brain all right here we go let's go Tick Tock uh Biden Administration in conjunction with Congress they're evaluating a new law that would make it possible for companies to be banned that pose a national security risk people think this means that they're going to ban Tick Tock what do you guys think should demand tick talk I don't know anything about that wow that's why they pay you the big bucks dude like people talk about I don't I don't know anything about China I don't know what they're doing that's true uh do you no no honestly I do not I mean how would I how would I really know um so I think that being able to ban something if it's a national security risk yeah I think that's fine I think that sounds like appropriate uh I also by using Tick Tock a ton I can totally see how I wouldn't want this in the hands of my enemy it's like oh the ability to like take in all of my data my camera roll turn my microphone my camera on as well as feed me spoon feed me any amount of any like feed of information based on you know a mysterious algorithm that can Surface good stuff bad stuff weird stuff misinformation whatever like that's a pretty powerful weapon right so so I definitely see the Merit in that now is Tick Tock actually a threat I don't all right what's the next one [Music] where's the worst heavy heavy actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better all right next one uh let's go with favorite cities a new poll from a real estate advice website reveals where Americans would move if Money Was No Object New York Austin's in there that makes sense also on the list though Las Vegas and at number nine Baltimore dude I'm from St Louis I'm from the city of St Louis A lot of people don't know this but if you look at what the highest murder rate per 100 000 people and it's been St Louis like either it's usually number one sometimes number two for the past 10 years there's like 500 murders a year St Louis and Baltimore very similar sucks it sucks I don't want to move there not at all I don't understand that that's weird to me once I worked in the media business I realized that uh polls rankings lists all [ __ ] just things to get generate clicks links controversy you know if I was going to make a list and I made a list that was like you just nod and you said yeah that makes sense you're not going to share that you're not going to talk about that I throw Baltimore as the this fourth most desired city to live in or whatever like put New York now you just make them outraged guess what I'm gonna get a lot more clicks a lot more discussion a lot more controversy and a lot more backlinks for my SEO and you know so so once you know their incentives you'll know why these lists are often outrageous either they're just paid to put like you know things on the top or they're trying to do things that will generate a bunch of shares do you uh do you know what state Baltimore's in yeah Baltimore is in Maryland all right nice I didn't think you'd get that if you Google if you Google Baltimore to let my breath in I was like of course I know that Baltimore dude Google Baltimore and look at the images very very unimpressive and not not impressive at all I'm sorry Baltimore that Skyline not interesting one bit the the tourist Association needs to work on their SEO not not so good uh what else you got bad can we wrap this up with the slap fighting one yeah do it do the story Sam so Dana White is putting muscle behind UFC uh sorry Dana White and the UFC is putting muscle behind power slap league so if you guys have not seen this it's basically two guys they're typically like huge fat guys standing at a table smacking each other I think they get three times the smack when they get the three times to smack each other I don't know the rules but it seems like someone gets knocked out every slap every fight yeah right what are the rules is it like the first one knocked out yeah loses or typically three to five rounds they take turns hitting each other in the face with an open hand and um the other person should just stand there and take it they get 60 seconds to recover and then they can earn up to 10 points based on the effectiveness of the slap and the defender's reaction oh that's good so you know I like things where you get rewarded for pretending like it didn't hurt uh because that's a skill that I I honed as a little sibling for many many years um dude this is the stupidest thing on Earth I don't know so look am I I'm not a woke guy I consider myself right of Center maybe I'm getting more woke as I get older I'm hating on nylon and also this slap thing is the stupidest thing on Earth and I'm not gonna give it any of my eye I'm not gonna give it any of my eyeballs I'd prefer to see two people in their underwear fighting to the death in front of a million people like UFC but the slab thing not a fan yeah like you know to me knockouts are like dip it's like you know I like chips and dip but if you take the chips away and it's just dip now I feel a little dirty that's how I feel about this like I'm cool watching a fight where somebody gets knocked out because their skill and there's defense and then there's strategy when it's literally you have to stand still and get hit as hard as you can by somebody else um now you I'm just you know now I'm just eating barbecue sauce and I I don't really which is kind of which is kind of ridiculous that it's considered okay that we can use a we can use a you know chip as a spoon and with cheese but when you just use a spoon as a spoon for that cheese it's we consider two different things that is a little weird isn't it big questions in life that I might spend a whole lifetime trying to wonder why we are the way we are in this way now let me tell you something that's a great example Michael Vick like got booted out of the NFL and like went to jail for a dog fighting ring Colin Kaepernick can't get a job because he you know took a knee during the national anthem too those two are not even remotely the same thing by the way I'm just saying people have got a lot more punished for a lot less than this how is Dana White not like how is he not canceled for doing this how is this legitimate thing that they're allowed to do um kind of insane to me that like you could you could get away with doing this and not others I I guess it's because they're consenting adults and that's that's the line I guess anything above that line works I don't know that sounds a little a little iffy to me but uh yeah I think this is so stupid I'm not going to give it I try not to give it my attention I can't stand it I think it's really dumb and they're all like I watched the trailer I was heavily entertained by it so you know this is from the trailer it's kind of like there's this subreddit called watch people die and it was like videos of people killing themselves and it was huge and people were obsessed with it and then they deleted it and I remember thinking that's a good idea to delete that and yet it was really hard not to go to that subreddit it's like it's it was impossible like when you see it when I would see it come up I'm like oh my God this is horrible I cannot watch this and I would have to look away I had to stop myself from like clicking some of that stuff let's finish with a little show recommendation have you watched physical 100 on Netflix you keep telling me to watch it no oh my God everybody needs to go watch the show and I'm gonna warn you it's a weird show if you had just described it to me I would not have watched it it's just that Korean Netflix thing in real life right it's squid games in real life yeah kind of so basically here's here's why it's amazing so the premise of the show is they got a hundred athletes of different types so bodybuilders MMA guys boxers women men small large gymnasts Ice Climbers luge people from the Olympics um whatever everything wrestlers and they put them all together and they walk in and it's basically like we're gonna see who is the mighty of athletic competitions um like who is the overall what is the best body what is the perfect body is it this guy or is it this girl or is it this guy and and so and like the very first like you know competition they have is basically there's a ball in the middle of a mud pit it's like Whoever has this ball at the end of three minutes wins and it'll be guyver's girl it'll be giant bodybuilder versus there's no weight class and no nothing and they go there but they're but the best part is it doesn't have this American tackiness like slap fighting or Ranch like Koreans don't eat that [ __ ] they don't do that stuff all these people here's the three reasons why it's amazing number one they got legit the best athletes so they literally got like the guy from the World's Strongest Man they're Olympians gold medalists like their most famous MMA fighters like they got their most famous athletes to go do this reality show it's like if LeBron was competing against Patrick Mahomes versus competing against Serena Williams but like they actually and they not only they show up they actually gave a [ __ ] like they were like I really want to win this and so they weren't just there for like reality drama that's the first thing second thing they play with honor so they'd be like you the winner of the first round gets to pick who opponent's gonna be the second round it's like oh well you know an American would just be like oh I can beat this person so I'm gonna choose the weakest one and I'm gonna do that and then what they would do is they would go to whoever they felt was the strongest that would be the most honorable to compete against and they'd be like it would be my honor to compete against you the whole thing's down to the subtitle so I'm sorry I dubbed so it's like it's all in Korean but then you're listening on a dubbed thing which is hilarious because there's even some guys that speak English they dubbed them also in more English it's hilarious so so they that's how the show works and they just eliminate people until they get to the very end the final winner of the physical 100 and so you this is like you will love the show once you get in you get two episodes deep you're gonna love the characters which which body type is best well I don't want to give it away I mean this is this is the show right so like this this is a giant spoiler um but you know you gotta have it all you got to have attributes you got to have the speed you gotta have the strength you got to have the endurance you gotta have the the dexterity you got to have the the agility you got to have it all because they test you in all these different ways how would a show is amazing you gotta watch this thing physical 100 how would I do oh here's the other thing that's great about it they don't really edit it so like in an American show they'll be like the start of the competition then there's like montage and then it's like the big fight they'll spend five minutes on the big argument the ending whereas with this it's like these contestants have one hour to pull this like 10 000 ton ship as a team to from one side of this room to the other go and they just show the whole thing in its entirety it's even a little bit boring sometimes but it's kind of like watching National Geographic where you just get really into it like planet Earth where you're like oh is the lizard gonna get the ant I gotta watch like and it's gonna just happen I'm gonna watch the whole thing play out you know with no no jump cuts and it's such a refreshing change from like Tick Tock and like these other things that are like just such level stuff I'm looking at the winner uh we're not we're not that different are we well don't give it away you'd be surprised why this person won it's it's pretty crazy so so anyways yeah you got to watch the show it's kind of amazing all right that's it that's a pod [Music] foreign [Music]

Dave's back and Dave's back in a big way here's some things that Davis said he says he has a 600 million dollar real estate portfolio that is fully paid off so 600 million dollars of real estate Equity that he that he owns that's kind of insane his media Empire which is like you know the combination of his um radio shows and then all of the financial like courses training seminars all that stuff that they do outside of that he says on their website makes 300 million a year in Revenue [Music] all right we're live um what do you want to talk about today I've got a bunch of good topics let me bring up one juicy one last year or two years ago you asked me a question you're like who do you admire I think you asked me that and I said this guy named Laird Hamilton Laird Hamilton is this like beautiful surfer dude he's like in his 50s now basically he's beautiful like we get a we gotta acknowledge that he's got like beautiful wavy blonde hair and like a nice skin and he's pretty ripped for his age and he always was ripped he's like this tough guy that surfs big waves and whatever he launched this thing called where you make fun of me because I'm dreaming about this guy I don't even need to make a joke you've done it all yourself here now like this is like this is like objective like I'm just stating facts here he's a human Ken doll he launched this thing called layered superfoods have you heard of that it's like a coffee creamer that's made out of like coconut I think right uh anyway I uh they took the company public I don't know why they did that but they took it public at a 300 or 400 million dollar market cap at the time they were doing 50 million in in Revenue look up the company now can you look can you go and look up the do you know what their market cap is today let me find it I know what it was yesterday I don't know what it is today why would it be so different oh wow nine million dollars nine million dollars so this company uh I if you click uh I have a bunch of notes here you can click them and read them but basically this company they sell like a fair amount of like coffee creamer so yesterday I think it was 8.8 million dude so listen they have 20 million in cash no debt at all their revenue is decreasing so it like in Q3 it was 8.8 million from Q3 of last year was 10.9 million so what's that like a like a like a four times eight so it's a 48 million dollar or 50 million dollar a year business but it's declining they're they have good decent gross profit they have an okay balance sheet but like the business for some reason it's valued so low I'd have to dive deep into it and really look at the numbers but it's kind of ridiculous right so you were talking about wanting to buy a company you've said this before this is your target dude we get to hang out with layered him sounds like it's your target dude that sounds like this is like you know those things where it's like we're auctioning off a date with Laird Hamilton it's like a hug why don't you buy this yeah you you just bought yourself a nine million dollar hug foreign dude why is this why is this company you haven't looked at this but why is this company so cheap what is going on I don't know how much debt they have but none I said that so I read their report they had their uh Q3 reports 21 million dollars in cash zero debt zero debt so I never understand when when companies trade this far below their just cash value because you know the obvious question then is why do you not buy this thing for 15 million and just wind it down and distribute the 20 million to yourself uh and make five million dollars you know like or sell the inventory they have like 13 million or something in inventory okay uh interesting so yeah so I mean I haven't looked at this because you just mentioned it but um but yeah there's a bunch of these right now that are like this uh there was one the other day that I that I saw that was kind of in the same same bucket but there's a bunch of stocks that are down like 95 right now that seem like you know interesting takeover targets and uh we have a friend who was interested in doing this and so I made a list of like 10 I was like here's 10 that I think you could buy is this friend aggressive is it aggressive friend I got it I know yeah okay I know which friend it is how tight is that by the way just to be able to say this is an aggressive friend and you're like yeah I know who it is does this friend would this friend say to a a battling entrepreneur your business is one Google away from me ruining you baby they usually don't say things to to their to their faces like that they uh they're more just like another under like you know those sharks that swim only under the water they don't put the fin out he's more like that got it but like wish.com was the was the other example that that I had recently seen that was like this which is uh wish you know pretty big brand name because they spent billions of dollars marketing this thing 10 billion dollar market cap at one point now 360 million so 10 billion to 360 million has seven 700 million in cash with no liabilities um you know so so I don't know exactly uh you know I don't I don't know exactly how you can buy these things I think that's the the challenge is like to actually acquire the majority in doing so you would push the price up because people would know what you're doing so I think you'd have to make like a tender offer at a specific price that's like you know whatever whatever you know some something above but you know the board will just reject it they'll say we have more cash than that on the on the balance sheet so we don't need to sell at this price so I don't know exactly mechanically how somebody does this I don't know if this is like uh you know fantasy math where you're like dude what if Shaq was in the you know the 100 meter race he could just knock people over it's like that's not it doesn't make sense it's not helping to work in the real world so you know this like idea of like public company takeovers is not something that I understand you know is that like a drunken conversation you've had which is can check when the 100 meter dash you know the one thing about this podcast is the number of on the Fly analogies you have to create it just really brings it's that's a different skill that's a different muscle and uh yeah that muscle's not not so strong yet I'm still working on it so anyway layered superfood interesting company that I was that I was iron layered maybe a little less hot in my book now because this company is worth only eight million it's a 300. now he's just a really hot fit guy before he was hot fit and Rich so he lost the Third Leg of the stool yeah he's still famous and famous Trump's wealth in most cases in most people's eyes but anyway all right well let me tell you let me tell you about somebody who is Rich and somebody who is famous but he's not hot can I tell you okay um are you familiar with Dave Ramsey yeah yeah yeah very tell me what you know about Dave Ramsey and I'm Gonna Fill In some gaps for you so Dave uh he's like a personal finance Guru he's based out of Franklin Tennessee he's in his 70s probably now he started as a radio host where it was just like Dave Ramsey like show and then he parlayed that into like the Dave Ramsey Network so now he has like four or 500 employees based out of Franklin Tennessee and they do like 400 or 500 million a year in Revenue where they sell like personal finance stuff a lot of his I think he's pretty controversial because a lot of his Like rules his lot of his personal finance rules are based in like biblical Like rules he also bleeds in like zero debt and he uh he's pretty conservative so people who aren't conservative aren't into him okay well you do a lot more than I would have guessed so yeah I guess the segment's over like Franklin Tennessee how do you know this stuff what's going on here he also bought all of his buildings without any debt so he owns like a campus in Franklin Tennessee yeah yeah so I'm sorry but did I I don't know you know well spitted my food but all right I'm still hungry so let's go um so Dave he's 62 years old uh he was a realtor turned radio host and yeah he's from Tennessee uh so basically what happened is by his mid-20s this is like back in the 80s so back but dude you didn't know who Dolly Parton was and she's also a Tennessee person so like yeah I guess I I lesson learned I'm not coming at you with any Tennessee trivia anymore so by his mid-20s he's got like a four million dollar property portfolio real estate portfolio and it's kicking off some cash maybe like five percent a year cash or cash return so he's making 250k a year off his real estate portfolio at that stage um at this time 1988 so the you know the year I'm born his bank basically revokes his line of credit and um demands that he pays it back and he couldn't sell fast enough so he gets foreclosed on and declares bankruptcy this is like the trauma of why he's like um don't notice debt no debt he's like dead bad debt bad why because I burned my hand on the debt stove before this and so he's like he's got no money now he's you know his marriage is on the Rocks he says he could be you know considering committing suicide uh but you know he gets back on his feet so this is kind of like his story so anyways today fast forward to today Dave's back and Dave's back in a big way here's some things that Davis said he says he has a 600 million dollar real estate portfolio that is fully paid off so 600 million dollars of real estate Equity that he that he owns that's kind of insane his media Empire which is like you know the combination of his um radio shows and then all of the financial like courses training seminars all that stuff that they do outside of that he says on their website makes 300 million a year in Revenue I believe it which is absurd I don't know any people that go to that what's that no you know people anybody that goes so dude in the South it's a thing so I had Texas employees and like if you're just like a normal couple where each employee makes or each wife and husband makes like 60 or 70 grand a year you'll like pay to go to like a Dave Ramsey like he trains these financial advisors and they host seminars and you'll go to this like five day weeknights thing where it's like instead of Bible study it's like we teach you how to like save and like invest like yeah it's like Jesus on the front and a p l on the back this new remix Bible I love it his company Ramsay Solutions is just absolute Juggernaut it's insane so so okay let's break down the media side so he launches this thing in 1992 and basically he's done content for 30 years about the same seven steps it's like this guy's just been talking about the same thing I don't know how he feels like hours I've never listened to like a full thing but I don't know he feels like four hours a day of radio it's a good show just saying the same thing every time like oh you got debt pay that off right so he's got these seven tenants so here's his seven tenants all right uh number one you establish an emergency fund of a thousand dollars that's your first baby step to Financial Freedom and Jesus Bliss second one you want to pay off all your non-housing debts ASAP starting with the smallest one so that he calls this a snowball so don't pay off like the highest rate interest just pay off the smallest thing you can just to get momentum all right I like that then you increase your emergency phone to three to six months of income then you put 15 into a 401k or IRA then you start your five five you know 529 plans or whatever like the college funds uh you pay off your mortgage and then you now you're fully paid off you got your you got your safety net now you start to build wealth and so that's his like those are his seven steps his company Ramsey Solutions is a biblically based Common Sense Financial education Media Company [Laughter] hey YouTube editor play that clip of like you know Jay-Z the first time he hears like the intro to like you know um Timberland's playing him a beat and he's like oh that's nice that's how I feel when I hear the biblically based Common Sense Financial education Media company so that's amazing then he's got you said you talked about this like uh Nat I guess Tennessee like Empire he's got he's got a thousand employees working there he owns all the real estate so he's got a he owns I don't know this is correct the researcher might have just gone off the rails dude he owns a lot he owns a lot he owns two office towers that are 200 million square feet that sounds absurd that's I don't that's too much not real um you know we got to get the researcher you know stop drinking your your product that you were selling from from college yeah um but but he's got basically like you know a 50 000 square foot Event Center he's got 60 Acres of just like property land that he bought for 10 million dollars so owns a bunch of land uses that land to run his kind of like you know you know Common Sense biblical Financial Empire out in Tennessee he's doing his show for three hours a day five days a week people call in and they're basically like all right Dave you know long time listener first time caller uh and you know there's part of it that's sort of like my first million I actually think we should steal his stick uh which is he goes yeah they'll call him they'll be like I I'm worth four million dollars and be like how old are you I'd be like I'm 32 years old would be like fantastic 34 minutes he's writing notes this whole time and then he'll be like um how much debt and they're like yeah I got my mortgage you know 800 000 and you could just hear him like just hit someone with a little a little tisk uh you know it's like dad's disappointed in me and then he'll be like you know I'm making this much a year I put this much away and blah blah blah and then he gives him Financial advice which is kind of the same with financial advice every single time but somehow people like get really into this uh this thing and then the other things he does which are just these hilarious segments that he has uh so he's got everyday millionaires so somebody calls in he interviews somebody that's that's worth a million dollars but then he has and this is good the debt free scream have you seen this before well I I used to think that it was like the equivalent of ringing a bell like there yeah he had like a he had a thing where people would call him be like I finally paid off my debt and they like celebrate it they celebrate it with the debt-free scream I think there's things we could learn from this guy I think we should steal some of this guy's shtick um and and so he's he's really got something going here anyway so you wait you've never heard of him no no I've heard him I didn't realize how rich he was I just thought he was like someone's dad that gives basic Financial advice because he's got the dad Vibe he's got the vibe of someone who calls diabetes diabetes like that's the you know what I mean like like the thing above your head is definitely a rough to him not a roof uh he's got that type of 100 on the diabetes thing yeah and the podcast I need to now laugh for 30 minutes I don't want to do the rest of the fight that's that's his Vibe he's a little judgmental too and he's like uh this is the only way yeah so he's not opinionated I mean he's Dr Phil for money he's exactly you know he's got his thing which is like this is how you do things and he's like a guy with a big belly who wears suspenders Vibes you know what I'm talking about like like that like that type of vibe so he's not wrong it just sometimes is energy I think is a little bit judgmental yeah yeah exactly um yeah exactly okay I was gonna make a bunch of jokes about his look but I decided to turn the other cheek or whatever he would want me to do so his show is like nationally syndicated on radio which I think is like the hack so 20 million people a week apparently listen to this I don't know how they it's huge but like when I basically Drive I would listen to it all the time yeah of course you did of course you're his target market um so you know he's basically carried about like 600 radio Affiliates I think that's amazing so he's got his books he's got 23 best-selling books I don't know what that even means uh that's like their that's what do you think that means that's their personality so he's got like his daughter does it now and he's got these other people like Ken and Dr John and like all these other people that he's created as other other kind of personalities or Brands they're called the Ramsay personalities um so he's got the man anyways live speaking courses they got an app they have you know all kinds of stuff it's kind of crazy so let me give you some of his some of his tweets some of his tweets are quotes I want you to react to him with a hallelujah or a uh no brother not for me all right that's the first one if you're working and paying off debt the only time you should see the inside of a restaurant is if you're working there A Hallelujah I'll give you that A half-hearted Hallelujah that's fine if you come to work late and they're paying you you're stealing don't steal and expect to be promoted Hallelujah I'm a capitalist Pig there's nothing socialist about me I'd put my my receptionist on straight commission if I could figure out a way 100 Hallelujah I love that one all right Dave Matthew now you're talking about my style all right here we go um if somebody calls in and they got more debt than their annual income he'll say that's a small shovel and a big hole I love that I love that Dave um okay then he also says uh he quotes he quotes the Proverbs 22 7 and states the rich rule over the poor and the borrower is a slave to the lender no I think that that's wrong I think that you can use debt like effectively to help you sure um Terry's a gun guys guys guys awesome guys awesome and uh I did not he carries a gun Carries a Gun he carries a a 45 with hollow point bullets according to himself you know what a 45 is that's a pretty big round uh yeah that's the biggest round I know of that's a big that's a big round um yeah so anyways fascinating guy in his 60s that like I I could not believe his Empire generates this much cash 300 million a year is a is a pretty absurd number for this dude and he's been doing that for decades it just shows you how big the Tony Robbins Empire must be like Tony Robbins says this thing during his his things he goes my business is bringing over 500 million dollars a year um but I didn't know what that means because like it's like when a Ad Agency guy's like oh I've spent over 100 million dollars you know uh you know 100 we've generated over 100 million dollars in Revenue it's like no dude you took the company gave you a budget you pushed spend at the average normal rate um and you've done this for 10 years and you added up their total revenue number like that that's not you um or like you know a lot of people will say they own 100 million dollars of real estate with and like okay cool you know so what's your equity in that and they're like well it's 80 bank loan so the bank loans 80 of it and then of the 20 down I syndicated that out and so I got a three percent broker Commission on it and I owned two percent of the of the property it's like okay let's be a little more real about it so to me it was pretty stunning to hear that he's got a 600 million fully paid off real estate portfolio and a 300 million dollar year business up higher if those numbers are to be believed I could also see this being totally full of by the way no no no no no no it's not full of it's definitely not full of I don't have any way to verify it but like I know his reach and I know that that is like very attainable to God yeah dude did you just read a book on on Words Christians say no dude it's the flooding a little special something in me today either I'm gonna get canceled or I'm gonna get a good laugh out of you and that is worth the risk to me have you been south of the Mason-Dixon Line man have you like been in the midwest apparently not you went to Duke but Duke's not really the south I mean my skin color is allowed south of the Mason-Dixon line I don't know what that is have you hung out in like Tennessee and Missouri Kansas Alabama you've never hung out in these places have you look out is there something to do there have you ever even been I drove through but I came to California I had to step through the mud of the Midwest dude you gotta go man Oklahoma all jokes aside so you know I got myself a southern street cred ential certificate just because you've been to the airport don't mean you've been there that's like with the thing you got to get out man even just go to like this sounds very get out is right if you're in Tennessee you do got to get out dude just go exactly you're a good drive an hour and a half north and go to a Walmart and just chill and just watch what people purchase and why do they buy you got to get out of your little San Francisco bubble my man you got to get out and see like there's 350 million people in America this is I gotta tell you a funny story yesterday I went to go I left my house for a meeting so I go meet somebody very interesting I might tell you about this later uh in the pot so I go meet somebody very interesting and who um I'm deciding if I want to save it to do a bigger thing or he's going to come on as a guest or maybe I'll tell you about it I haven't decided yet so do I know them no uh I don't think because they're they're not in your world right like you know about Dolly Parton you don't know about like you know the NBA uh you know so it's like a different different yeah another big baseball guy so uh uh brought by my wife and kids came with me it's like kind of kind of a long drive I was like oh why don't we all drive down there together uh you know Nanny's out sick just drive down together we'll go to McDonald's afterwards and my kids love like getting a Happy Meal toy so it's like we'll do that there's none around us we'll go go out there so we go to this McDonald's kind of out you know I've driven an hour away we're going to this McDonald's out there and um there's a so I'm wait I'm like waiting and what I think is the line but you know McDonald's is kind of ambiguous with the line there's not like they don't have like the airport order at the checkout or you have the self-checkout too no well there's like self-checkouts like to the left and the right and then there's like the cashier in the front and there's some people just waiting for their order you don't know if they're in line or not like you don't know what's going on and so there's a guy in front of me and uh the cashier's just like waiting and I was like I was like oh uh you can go she's ready and then the cashier just goes he doesn't have money [Laughter] and I was like I thought it was such a funny thing for the lady to say now he doesn't have money like that's so funny to me like so outrageous of a comment like why did she have to say it like that but it was like the most direct line of the answer like not like no you can go ahead he's not he's not ready or he's not ordering [Laughter] take someone's food that didn't show up or something I don't know what he's doing I was in the bathroom at the airport recently and uh there was like there's like a line for the urinal but there was also like a line for the Stalls and the guy walks up to me and he looks at the the stall and he looks at me and goes [Laughter] [Music] you waiting to poop yeah dude and then you have to answer too right like you can't not answer at that point oh my God why am I why am I paying it playing into this it was just a dead face it's just looking at he goes you went to poop and I was like a 12 year old I don't know why I thought that was so bad um oh my God uh I have another business you wanna talk about business or no yeah yeah yeah of course um we're idiots um uh by the way if you're listening in Austin um we're doing an event well actually we're doing two events I think the second one's not confirmed the second one is Sean and I doing a live pod late April we're gonna have more on that right bro that's it's confirmed we're doing it we just don't know the venue yet we don't know the venue yet we need to know is it gonna be 300 people a thousand people or three thousand people that's that's kind of the only thing that that we're missing here is how many of you will show up to this live show in Austin where we can we're gonna we're gonna put on a little show we're gonna meet and greet have some fun maybe do a little private dinner uh with some people afterwards so I think we should we're gonna do that end of April where do they go to like sign up for that we'll put the link in the description here yeah and then go to and what's our website called mfmpod.com mfmpod.com which is like myfirstmilionpod.com and then we're we're doing another one this one is not a Wii this is a me Sean's not coming to this one it's just a casual hangout session we're doing that uh mid when is when is that on a week mid-march is it March 15th so Wednesday March 15th it's free you can just show up and we're just gonna hang out and you can find that also on mfmpod.com or by the time this episode's air airs I will have tweeted it so you can go to my uh Twitter handle the stamp part and see it Sam I'm in a great mood can I tell you why yes I did something that I forgot is an amazing tactic and technique so I'm gonna say it out loud here so other people could do it but also it's a reminder to myself to do it have you ever heard of something called flooding no is that when you text someone a lot of no I have no idea it could be a lot of things don't Urban Dictionary it's probably something weird but uh here's here's how I learned about it uh Tony Robbins talked about this thing so he goes somebody asked them they go what's a like you know marriage like advice or a thing you do in your marriage that like you know uh makes it better and he he basically had like two stories that I really loved I'll skip the first one for now I've told it I teach it my course but I'll skip that one for now the second one that he had said was he goes about once a month we'll do something called flooding which is basically us we sit down on the on the couch you know like we're about to watch Netflix or something else but instead of just mindlessly vegging out to some TV we watch videos or photos uh we go of some part of our past some some era of our past so maybe like this vacation that we went on or our wedding or whatever and you basically you'll get this flood of memories and emotion that are linked and anchored to those moments uh but most people don't like revisit it in a kind of like in in a like like a conscious way or an intentional way like this and I do this in two ways um one I'll do it with like life photos or memories uh videos or videos or photos the second one is and this is the one I did before this which is why blog post or something pull up a bunch of videos that were really funny to me back in like the day back in college like back when YouTube was like the new and like you know things would go viral but it was like yeah e-bombs world like things would go viral and like everybody knew about that that video you know whatever that Charlie bit my finger or whatever but there's this set of videos that were so funny to me and they're not even that fun now that I go back and look it's kind of like an old movie where you're like dang this movie doesn't it doesn't hold up it doesn't it doesn't have the same juice like things are much funnier now like the average Tick Tock is funnier than the best videos back in like 2006 which which videos did you look at uh okay this is gonna sound uh dumb but have you ever seen this video uh you know 12 year old boy uh disclaimer here we go I visited this video of this cop pulling over this guy he's got his hands above his head it's like this yeah yeah yeah and he goes he's patting them down and he goes he goes all right let me just check Pockets hold on here we go up hey what what's this and the guy goes that's my penis and he goes that's your penis and then he continues and this video cracks me up just the way he goes That's What penis that's your penis and so there's that video but then there's just a whole bunch of these that were like just goofy videos yeah a lot of them were like you know the news anchors interviewing some like that kid who's like I like turtles kid or like the grape stomp video or like whatever this is a whole bunch of these and I watched like six of them and they just cracked me up in this like where it's like uh a simpler time wife and a mortgage I didn't have it you know it's just literally that was like the those videos were just took me back they just teleported me and so highly recommend this this idea of flooding uh you probably have done some version of this on accident but like make it a practice it's pretty awesome and it just puts you in an amazing mood this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed club spot grow better so I did it recently so I'm going to tell a story that I you and I were texting about and I can't reveal what I was selling because it was kind of against the law and I didn't know it at the time but I told the statute of limitations you're way past that it's been more than 10 years is that a real life that's definitely a figure of speech here's what we'll do we can mention I'll I'll say it was alcohol that's all I will say it was legal alcohol that I was selling that's all I'm gonna say um I was like anytime you have to specify it was legal probably not a good thing so well so here's the story I tweeted out that I think I it always bothers me when people collect domain names that's a that's a pet peeve because I because I'm saying if you're doing that you're doing the wrong stuff because people say I'm gonna I've got this great idea I'm gonna buy a domain name or even worse I'll say I've got this amazing domain name I should build something for it I'm like dude don't build something just because they have a domain name so anyway I tweeted out I'm like just make money first and just use like a you know store name.squarespace.com for like the initial like hundred bucks in sales and then go and get the domain name like and someone's like you can't do that I was like oh no I've done it a bunch of times I'm like yeah well you're doing it because you have a name it's like no I didn't actually in college tons and tons of times in fact I found this old website that I had and it was um alcohol name dot wordpress.com right and I went and looked at the old stats and it's getting 5 000 views a month still on a wordpress.com free website in this it's a store it's a quote a store that is a blog post and a click to PayPal and basically what I did was there was this really unique drink that was sold in Nashville and for some reason only one or two stores were carrying it but this particular type of drink was popular across the country and I thought well I should set up an online store to sell this stuff and I did and I made friends with the person selling it the the liquor store or whatever and I go hey I'm gonna sell this for 3x the markup but I'll buy a bunch of it from you so whatever and I did it and I didn't I'm an idiot I didn't realize that like as this thing was growing I was making like a lot of money and I went and told the legal team at my college I was like hey I think my business is like working really well do I need to set up like an LLC or something and they're like oh you're breaking the law like you can't you can't sell this without like a liquor license I was like but it's like a collect it's basically this thing that I was telling it was it was a very rare whiskey that was in a very particular type of bottle that was like a collector's item and I thought like it was just like collectors item I don't even know if people are gonna drink this thing so anyway it was making like a thousand dollars a day sometimes and I looked at the old blog post that I was selling this and it was hilarious and it reminded me like of a simpler time when I was sleeping on a mattress on the floor yeah and life was good and I was building motorcycles in my living room and it was working out well so I was like building motorcycles in my living room sleeping on the floor collector's whiskey illegally on the internet it was a simpler time the American dream the American dream I was one of those kids that had you probably had this too I didn't have beer like you remember those college kids that would have like beer cases the cardboard on their wall yeah I wasn't that bad but I did have an American flag I definitely had the American flag so I was pretty trashy but uh yeah I was so I was looking at my old like blog that I used to do and I couldn't even remember the password and uh so I flooded myself a little today um the good thing is by the way this whole if you're not watching on YouTube You're missing half of it because Sam's wearing a Harvard sweatshirt while we tell these stories we do we decided about someone illegal whiskey waiting to poop you made a bunch of jokes about the south this is so stupid ugh oh my god um all right I have something for you so there's this company that's for sale that I came across so check it out go to chambers.com Chambers okay yeah like that Harry Potter stuff Chambers Chambers and partners is that it yeah yeah okay okay dude check this out so this website they uh I think they're mostly in Europe but they are in America as well is they put out these rankings once a month or once a quarter something like that and they go and they interview lots of I think they have 200 employees who do this 200 employees who go out and interview different lawyers they talk to your past clients and they try to like see which cases you're winning and it's all done manually like there's not like a lot of like Tech behind it and then they create these rankings for like best legal firm or whatever like that or like you know a good firm for this good firm for that like different niches and then they put out these rankings and if you're a lawyer you can pay money uh and and get like a plaque they'll send you a plaque and then also they'll allow you to use their like thing in the in their like when you send an email it could be like voted a top lawyer by Chambers and you could do and you could do all that dude this company they do 44 million Euros or yes or sorry 44 million pounds so what's that in real real money that's like 60 million in revenue and then 18 million in profit and they're selling right now for close to 500 million dollars it's a crazy company because I've been for sale somewhere uh just like on a trade magazine for uh media companies that I follow it's like a small thing called fashion Flames because this cut that website they cover like B2B Media stuff because I'm like been obsessed with B2B database of the B2B media thing Flash and flames.com I love it it's like my favorite site I didn't even want to tell people about it because I like how you tried to just mutter it it's a good one like I'm a paying subscriber to it which is like ridiculous uh but dude these lawyers pay like 1500 to 4 000 a year and they said they have like no churn they're like we have we no insurance from our from us because these lawyers want it for so much these lawyers wanted so much and I uh am interested in this and I found like eight or nine other businesses they call them like data businesses or databases or intelligence businesses and they're not really much Tech but right now a lot of them are selling for eight to ten times revenue and I found 10 examples of companies that have sold in the eight to ten times Revenue range for one of these data businesses it's ridiculous it's crazy and this sounds like a scheme um because what they do is they rank you and then they go hey if you want like to make like a special profile on our website uh we'll do that and it's forty five hundred dollars a year and what we'll do is uh like once ranked you could purchase this one pager where you get a profile on our site it's almost like a Wikipedia page where they like one of the journalists just writes like two paragraphs and it says like this legal firm is known for X Y and Z and then you could put that if you're a lawyer you could put that in your email signature and you're allowed to do that and then people can click and see whatever it's crazy man this is a caper they're pulling it off and I and I love stuff like this you know it's like JD Power we talked about you know how you know they're smart because their logo is like it looks like a medallion like a like it looks like a special emblem or a ward like it's a c with this like I don't know what you call these but like the pedals going around it um yeah put this on the YouTube channel so that people could see it but like a reef it's yeah it's like it's like a reef around it that like just looks like you know what the Olympics in Athens would would award their uh the top performers right so like you you they're they're really playing into the whole thing with their brand uh so I think that's pretty cool I have a business and their name is Partners I'm gonna create like something like this just do you know Partners mayonnaise and partners you know like we'll just do something for the people you know we break we rank best condiments mayonnaise and partners I gotta figure this out and we can put this on the logo but I love these rating businesses what's the one you have that's similar uh so I was have you ever done like like uh trademark search yourself no what's that like when you start a business and you want to look up is this a good name what do you do do you pay a lawyer and say hey can you just tell me if this trademark's available do you do that later once you get going I will do that later once I get going is there is there an importance to having a trademark yeah it's very hard to sell a company without a trademark did you sell the hustle without a trademark I didn't have a trademark yeah typically uh it's very hard to get acquired without owning your name because it's a giant liability so for example like if somebody else owns the trademark if you get six years in you're gonna have to change your name because the more valuable you get the bigger your exposure is for them to say I own the trademark this you have to change your name or but maybe my name I mean it was called The Hustle maybe it was too broad of a name you know what I mean well I don't know there's probably some troll out there listen to this being like hey hang on let me go get this guy so um dude I'm past the Reps and warranty like the SQL has been paid out so there's a great uh there's a great um story I think uh the early episode where Moyes came on and told the native story so it's like I don't know episode 10 of this podcast um always tells a story about like when they tried to sell native um they got in trouble with this so they go they have a deal to sell native and as they're doing the diligence or like as they're prepping for the diligence they're like we don't have the trademark for Native uh Native deodorants and they're like okay well let's just get it and they're like well you can't get it because somebody else owns it they're like what who owns data deodorant there's no other native deodorant look I have the domain and they're like well no there's this guy and I think it was like someone in Palo Alto if I remember the story correctly I might be butchering a little bit of this but somebody in Palo Alto who was like kind of like a patent troll type that owned the name to it and owned a bunch of names like this and they were like and he's like okay I guess I can go buy it off them because they're not doing anything with it so he goes to them tries to buy for like whatever 20K they're like no so he's like okay yeah whatever goes up 200k no and like the guy wanted millions of dollars for this name because he knows your business is valuable you need this name you're gonna change your brand name for your consumer package good that's like you know you can't change Doritos to be called you know like like fluffies you know tomorrow it doesn't work you lose a lot of value and so they were like going back and forth I forgot exactly how he got resolved I think he ended up buying it for two million or something like that or voice did I think so or um something else happened where they like threatened to they were just like all right screw you we're not going to do it at all and the guy like realized it was like his last ditch effort and like and they ended up getting it for whatever some amount um you know I forgot I forgot what it was but they acquired it in the end but yeah anyway so so I've had this problem with the business of mine which was that I up from I'm like you I'm like oh I don't need a fancy domain I don't need a fancy name let me just start the business and go and then I start and it goes and it gets popular and then I'm like okay I should probably like incorporate the company and do like payroll and do like all these things I should I you know I should have been doing it important but like I didn't wanna do all that stuff if there wasn't like a real business here and so then you try to go back and some things are easier than others to correct going backwards one of the things that's hard to correct is if you chose a name that wasn't right you know you have a problem and so with one of my businesses I had done the actual search myself I should have just paid a lawyer to do it but I went on the USPTO search website which I don't know if you've ever gone there but it's like you know imagine like a government it's like a DMV website and so you go there you try to search and I search for our brand name and nothing came up but it turns out there's like a fancier way to search where it's like yeah that brand name or like with an S at the end or like with Associated other words that would make it too close and I didn't know that and so I remember being so frustrated with this interface and I was like somebody should make a because this is a it's a public database it's like somebody should just make a more consumer-friendly layer on top and then I found a business that does this and I got in touch with the guy who does it so there's a business called trademarkia.com so it's like trademark with IA so trademarkia.com if you go to it all of a sudden it's like like if you just compare side by side like in the YouTube channel you should do this like take USPTO and try to find even where do you go find search for trademarks and then like how that looks versus this where it just says search 11 million trademarks for free search your thing example Mickey Mouse and it's like you can just type in your brand name so like if I typed in you know the hustle uh I'm gonna search for this and it's gonna tell me what trademarks exists for this who owns them this company kills it what categories are there okay so so HubSpot HubSpot owns it now so it says the hustle hope saw owns it it's pending and it was filed December 3rd 2022. when did you sell uh December uh two years ago what would that be 21 yeah so 20 okay wow so they yeah I didn't own it they also it also looks like you abandoned one in 2020 um so you know somebody did something on your team maybe tried and didn't get it or whatever it tells you what class it's in et cetera et cetera so it's a great great little thing and you can search for like Associated names or whatever it's a great website and so I reached out to the guy who owns it I was like dude this is uh and so I I said um trademark is a great great idea brilliant interface um you know yeah props to you and he goes uh so the guy lives in the Bay Area actually and he goes yeah it's a really cool website um you know we have five million in AR um and I can't you know if uh we've never raised VC 5 million in ALR it was kind of declining from the peak but I just came back to the company removed the subscription I got big plans now you know I want to talk to you about it and um you know he's gonna try to make this like he wants to go for like the billion dollar outcome and I was like dude I think you have a five million dollar your cash cow um that you could probably get to like eight or nine with just like some simple tweaks and like you know chill like that that sounds awesome um but but I thought this is a really cool website again it's just a simple like these businesses are everywhere man these businesses are hidden in plain sight and in this case it took a public data set it just put a much more user-friendly wrapper on top versus what you were talking about with Chambers is they created their own data set and then have then they owned that proprietary data it's called uh you know uh uh who was it a non from CBM sites was on and he was like no we just like taking public data that's messy and we just make it a little bit easier to yeah we just make it clean um by the way my first million is owned by Advanced magazine Publishers which is a big company in New York and it's a entertainment services namely an online non-downloadable video series featuring star athletes explaining their life as millionaires I guess that's that GQ thing which I search or where I see when I search on YouTube but uh anyway badass I love this effect uh you wanna I'm gonna go trademark this before this episode comes out because now somebody's gonna go squad on this do you uh and um a funny story about Native deodorant I've always remembered this story I've never brought it up to you so you and I the hustle's office in twitch's office was just a block or like 50 yards from each other so if you know there's there was like Kearney or whatever you were and then you were the left if you go to the right there was a little cafe that was lovely that I that I really liked and I believe Moyes the so native deodorant is a company called uh Native deodorant they sell deodorant it was sold for a hundred million dollars in in cash and it probably does hundreds of millions now and it has like a really cute branding they make shampoo they make everything and I remember walking by this lovely Cafe and I thought huh this Cafe is called native too and their logo looks just like native deodorant and I realized that Moyes worked nearby uh and so I put kind of two and two together so if you Google native Co SF yeah you'll see a little you'll see a little cafe uh you'll see their Yelp page they've changed their logo to uh green but it used to be yellow or sorry it used to be blue the exact same as native deodorant and so I have a feeling that he was just thinking branding by this and I was like this is I remember thinking dude boys they're ripping off your brand or are you doing it exactly and now it's realized the obvious he was like so all right I need a name looked out the window saw it it was like that's my name and my logo now that's mine if you go to this go if you look up native facing is exactly the same it's exactly the same and it used to be blue it looked like they're like they look like Nivea blue it was it was the white background with the same blue and now it's green it looks like they closed in covet and they moved to a new location but that old location that we were at it was the same logo and it was called native Co and I think Native deodorant was the domain was also native code for him yes it was it was the exact same thing and so he must have been just walking down the street and he goes like yep that's me that's mine now you know it's just like there's that Meme on the internet of like a stick figure handing an item to another stick figure saying hey I made this and the second stake a figure looks at it goes I made this that's basically what just happened and uh I don't think I've ever like said this to him but I would love to hear what his rebuttal is but he 100 stole the entire branding the name everything from this company I don't know if stealing's the right word but kinda I mean that one looks like stealing it looks like he actually went took a screwdriver took off took their sign off their office moved it across the street and put it on his office it's the exact logo I remember seeing that for years and being like huh and I just never like put two and two together I didn't realize he worked there but I was like wow they're really ripping off his branding no that's that Cafe has been there for years I remember walking by it for years well now they're shut down that's that I mean this is like everything that's wrong in society um you know he sells his business for 100 million dollars poor Cafe you know shuts down uh you know you know sadly during covet during the pandemic yeah this is the way the world is going dude have you seen people ripping us off I don't know if you've seen this but no but that's cool in the next two weeks you're gonna see Twitter threads linkedins short videos on Tick Tock other podcasts talking about the exact same stories that we tell here there's like this group of 10 people that just take our content and then they just exact same thing and they just tell that exact same story they're gonna be like dude Dave Ramsey Dave how Dave Ramsey built a 600 million dollar Empire animation this that and they're just gonna be like literally steal our stick it's it's kind of annoying I get it uh Michael from our future has done it a few times yeah they do yeah he's one of the ten that that does this all the time who are the other nine uh I mean I don't even really want to give them shine of of doing that you know this is literally if you're one of those people just you know this is this have your own silent embarrassment there's nothing wrong like taking ideas and remixing them uh but what most people do is they just take the same idea they just tell the same story uh the same way that we already told it in their own Twitter thread or their own LinkedIn and and whatever else um which is fine but like give credit at least if you're gonna if you're gonna say the same thing be like oh I was listening to my first million and they told this great story check it out all right now yeah that that's I think a slightly better way to do it um but you know whatever it is it is but this is why so I have a new project I'm actually going to announce it in about a month or three weeks this is why I didn't announce it I've been working on this for almost a year now I didn't want to announce it copycats everyone everyone talks about building public I hate building in public building in public is not cool when you're popular building in public is really cool when you want to get popular yeah exactly but once you already have a following I don't want to do it like the milk Road did you guys have a bunch of copycats yeah yeah tons uh there's like there's tons of embarrassing ones that are out there uh there's like people that literally just took the same exact newsletter and they would some people would translate it so they're like oh I'm you know leche leche whatever and it's like the Mexican milk Road and then they would translate it to Spanish and just like Google translate and then publish um there's another one that uh there's one I don't know if I want to put this guy on blast but um someone who tried to buy the milk Road and failed yeah I know then just tried to copy it in his own like way and you could just the funny thing is they very rarely work um they don't and it's like kind of surprising why don't they where I kind of expected them to work um like for example when people take our content and then write a thread about our LinkedIn like it does pretty good like that that kind of works for them otherwise they wouldn't really keep doing it but the copy the whole newsletter thing like for some reason that doesn't really work I'm not sure I'm not 100 sure I'll explain why I know why do you want to know the so basically if for people who have been raised on the internet they have a very high detector and you want to know the best way to circumvent someone's detector now don't you don't don't that's how you circumvent that detector you don't and people can sniff this out and so if they read something and it's like dude you're like a not cool older guy trying to act like a cool younger person I know that this is not good like this doesn't work I told you about the uh nqr right the the KFC's in China not quite right it's like dude it's the same menu like this is this is the spicy chicken sandwich and it's like that's not quite right and people it just doesn't taste right the taste buds reject it now I believe that when it comes to if I use one product and then somebody tries to copy it I'm like why would I want this shitty copy I'm just going to keep going with the original but in markets where you're reaching a new audience or people who haven't heard of the original I'm surprised it doesn't work and I think my theory of why it doesn't work in those cases I think you're right when it's uh when people have tasted the original that they don't really want the the or when it's like uh community community brand uh like personality driven you know it's it's that one moat that Peter Thiel doesn't understand brand yeah the one the Asperger proof uh yeah defense uh weapon we have so you know the one thing that I think is is true which is like this like Iceberg Theory which is which is like if you look at an iceberg like the part you see at the top is like you know five percent of the total mass that's there and so what I think people get wrong when they try to copy a business is that they only see the top the five percent and they're like okay I'm gonna copy that but they don't know what goes on underneath they don't know that basically the uncopyable thing is the the people the personalities the engine underneath that's coming up with the creative ideas that's coming up with the next marketing thing because this one starts to decline and so I think that's the part that's typically hard to copy but honestly I'm surprised that more of them don't work because if you're sufficiently talented I think I think it sadly does work more often than it doesn't we should do an episode where we talk about the things that people have copied and it's become better than the original um like there's stories of the samware brothers so it's these three brothers in Germany and they have the company called Rocket internet and it was a clone Factory and they basically it's a it was publicly traded until recently but the reason they started this company was they like cloned Amazon and all these other companies Zappos Uber things like that but before they started company started that company they cloned other things and they sold it to the original so they cloned eBay in Germany and they sold it back to eBay for 90 million dollars in like three months and then they were going to do the same thing with Groupon but they got bigger than Groupon and they realized oh wow once you get huge this business sucks we gotta offload it and then they try to do that with Zappos the shoe company but they got bigger than the original Zappos so the bigger they were their market cap was larger so they couldn't sell it and they uh like this is their whole strategy it's a very fascinating strategy and so far it's not panned out for them other than like hello fresh they did hello fresh and they copied blue apron and hellofresh worked right yeah I think there's an art there's an art to copying this is a whole whole I think we could do a whole podcast about like if you're gonna copy here's how to do it here's how to do it in a way that feels good to your soul feels good to customers actually works and is not just going to result in like a massive waste of time and so I think there's there's a bunch of different little factors there I think one thing the Samoa brothers did one of the factors for example is they um they did the same business in a different country and so I think you know Geographic Geographic differentiation is important um I think that's one that that that you can you can copy and make things work when you do Geographic difference uh but then there's some traps with that too that we could we could talk about but um all right where do you want it where do you want to finish up I think we should well there is one thing that we should do and yeah I forgot about that so you're aware of it I think I'm aware of it I can't seem to find my pen but I need it's okay you don't need you don't need a pen so basically but I thought I decided something some sort of you do but you you sign it but just with a click of a button so basically at this podcast my first million our content unlike every other content on YouTube it's actually not for free right not a free podcast it's not a free podcast because what you have to do if you've seen one more than one episode you have to do this thing called The Gentleman's Agreement which is it's called that because we're not there I'm not behind you to stare at your screen that's why honor the gentleman's agreement it's an honor code you have to basically go and uh click subscribe on YouTube because we'll get more subscribers that helps the algorithm we get more views and then we'll do more dumb stuff for you so it's called the gentleman's agreement if you've watched more than one video you have to do this everyone's doing it I have a addendum to the gentleman's agreement came from a from a listener she pointed it out she goes not only have I signed the gentleman's agreement I've signed the ladies understanding and what's the lady's understanding you know there's not many phrases that will stop me in my tracks but I was stopped in my tracks the lady's understanding I thought that was phenomenal the lady's understanding that's actually when you also click subscribe on the iTunes or the I always call iTunes on the podcast app and the Spotify app understanding go that extra mile and give us the ladies understanding along with the gentleman's screen since we started doing this so two things about gentlemen's remake number one it's funny because we're talking about copying you stole this stick from somebody dude I stole it and he called me by the way and he was like isn't that awesome it works so good and he invited me to go to a UFC fight and you did it right because you gave credit to him uh you put your own spin on it and uh yeah you credited him most importantly as being like this guy did this awesome thing and I was like wow I I gotta try doing this um so you know you credited him and that's cool that you guys are are going to see a fight together that's that's amazing now it's cute the second thing is we have grown a lot since we did this so we started doing this we were at 100 would you the first time you did it I believe we had 145 000 subscribers on YouTube it was like a month ago we have yeah that was like yeah maybe 45 days ago something like that and now we're at 180 000. and the people who watch the Youtube videos they know this in fact I'm looking at a tweet right now which he goes he goes he just mentioned us he goes watching on YouTube is better than Spotify but yeah no I told you this it is way better to want to and in fact what I think we should do to really like juice the agreement to even add more you know see appendix a of the gentleman's agreement I think we should do a piece of content that is only good when you watch it so so here's my here's my proposal to you Sam I think we should do basically like shirtless yeah Sam's gonna be shirtless and I'm gonna scream chair but I think we should feature us going through like a pitch deck and making taking one from average to awesome or like good to Great uh and just show how we would tweak the copy how we would make it look like better and we'll use a real one and so I think we should do that and put that only on the YouTube channel because it would only make sense to see it no I think that on YouTube you should log into chase.com and uh show show your checking account okay and it will react but we won't say the number that's genius you know this is why you complete me bro I gave you a shitty idea you gave me the old yes and we're gonna go to chase.com or whatever Bank of America whatever you use and you're gonna just we're gonna watch you log in and we're just gonna react and that's it by the way the yes and is the corniest thing that the startup World tried to take from from like the cool like you know people who are actually funny world because actually it's a no but this is what you just did there no but we should do this instead is a better amount of people and improv people are are one step below a cappella people in terms of the Nerds so like there's no way we're cool and improv people you ever been around an improper sense like being around someone who does CrossFit you know like just stop talking about it I can't stand improv people they're exhausting it's like uh people without muscle uh dude said it's like uh it's like a blind Jack Russell you know what those are it's like that dog that's yapping everywhere and when it's blind you just can't stop it's going all over the place that's what I feel about an improp person yeah I think you're I think you're right I did improv so I can confirm this is correct um and you're correct that it's below acapella which is below anything that's actually cool yeah Apollo is the worst of the worst I remember hanging out with people from New England and they like were bracking about acapella and I was like dude shut up why are you talking about that you don't want people to know and uh people hang out with each other and they're like ordering or they're like waiting for their food at the table and then one guy's like and then it's like um harmonizing it's like dude you gotta stop like you know if I hear The Lion King sorry one more time I'm gonna put a bullet in my head that's how I feel but when I'm with these people if I'm ever trapped on a subway and like they do a flash mob around me start singing are above last month people are are above the acapella I'm gonna do something I'm gonna start vomiting just out outrageous them that's the pod foreign

back in like late 90s trading desk was like a locker room it was very like Alpha driven a lot of hazing and [ __ ] but I mean I was at the time boxing for the New York Athletic Club I had played hockey I mean I was I worked in a prison for four years so these nerds were hazing me and one day I just cuffed the guy I just slapped him across the face and almost knocked him out of his seat and needless to say they fired me but I was covering these young guys at Enron and they told the senior Traders what had happened and one of the senior traders who happened to be from Martha's Vineyard outside of Boston called me up said hey I got a job I didn't even know we had competitors that's how naive I was I didn't know the other brokerage shops I was there like two months and um I mean I barely knew what had been an offer was were and um this other competitor offered me a job starting the next Monday [Music] all right we get right into this Ken uh thanks for coming man I uh do you know at all what you're getting into or no yeah yeah I heard uh Andrew huberman on the show my friend Andrew good well let me um I'll let you kind of do the intro but I want to tell our audience what I know about you and why I think it's cool that we have you basically I was telling Sean you're so we take pride in like finding people a little bit before they explode you're getting quite popular you're in the Wall Street Journal the other day so things are happening for you but you're to me like you're like the next David Goggins in my mind like you know you're kind of a freak athletically but you're also more so a freak mentally and you talk about a lot of like just being tough you got some crazy quotes that uh we'll talk about later about how uh uh you know like you like running because it's all about suffering and things like that and so you said a lot of really interesting things Sean and I are also a huge combat sports fans so I listen to the pie with Teddy Atlas that you're on and I know a bit about your background and so I wanted to have you on to talk about that typically we talk about business stuff huberman was a little bit of a we had him on and that was a little non-business you're a little bit non-business but you had like a interesting background where you worked on Wall Street worked on worked at Enron I think you did a bunch of interesting stuff and so that's kind of why we had you on what um how do you give your introduction what do you what do you say you do yeah well thank you for that introduction uh when I hear people introduce me sometimes I almost don't feel like they're talking about me because I I think part of what makes me unique is I at times have don't have the highest opinion of myself and always feel like I there's I should be doing more but um I think that the comparison to David Goggins is somewhat accurate although it's accurate I can see why others would think that but I don't think that it's a perfect and I take it as a compliment no I don't think he's soft at all I think he's probably maybe more more aggressive and uh Alpha than I am I would say I try to be I don't know I think that the way I come across you know when I was on Rich Roll he described me as being his his initial impression of me prior to meeting me was that I was very aggressive and uh Alpha and intimidating and I don't see myself that way I see why other people would see that but I think of myself as that that alpha or aggressive exterior is almost like a defense mechanism because inside I think I'm very emotional and sensitive and so much so that my way of protecting that sensitivity is to be so aggressive externally that it really takes someone unique and special to kind of see through it um at least that's my take from uh the the the Psychotherapy I've been involved in but the reason and the reason we had you on we typically so it's usually just Sean and I or it's like we'll have like billionaires and stuff on so like these like a wonderful people but something that like I've been thinking a lot about lately and I've been talking to Sean about lately it's just like toughness and like how it feels like good to get out there and work hard physically or to spar do things like that because even though we're doing cool [ __ ] behind the computer it's still behind the computer and it feels good to live and you say you're not an alpha but I think in the Wall Street Journal article you said uh I'm the biggest male I'm the biggest alpha male on the starting line I'm ready thank you for pointing that out because there was context to that quote I said my my exact quote was when I'm on the out when I'm on the start line when it's time to go 100 I'm Alpha I will step on your neck to win I want to kill you I want to destroy everyone but the minute that race is over I'm everyone's best friend if I see someone fall down in front of me I will stop and help them I've in triathlons I've asked people yo man you all right I'll stop and help you I'm not I say step on your neck and kill you to win but not really like this is this is my mental process that I have to go through to get to the dark place that I need to get to to suffer to the extent that I need to suffer to get the most out of myself running you know I ran uh 36 hours ago I ran the Tokyo marathon in 229.19 and the day before that and the day before that outside magazine wrote an article how 51 year old can ride out run sub 230 marathons and I saw the headline and I literally had an anxiety attack I'm like oh my god oh the pressure is on I mean I've run some 230 three or four times but it ain't easy and I know that that last five or six miles the suffering and the Darkness that's coming with that I can't it's it's literally the physically the hardest things that I've ever done is like you everything in your body would be like if you're driving your car in every single warning dollars going off the radiator is overheating the oil's low you're gonna run out of gas and you literally are like I can stop and no one would care or I can push myself and know that I didn't have another F and ounce to give and that's it sounds cliche or might sound corny but that's my process that's where I have to go to get to where I've gone to it's to the point where guys like you with this awesome plugins want to talk to me like I'm I'm a regular guy I'm a dope I I don't see myself as special with the exception of being willing to die to get the most out of myself physically on these particular days at races and you so you said you just ran you just ran the a marathon in Tokyo 36 hours ago you're here now and I didn't know much about you before Sam brought it up Sam goes oh I really want to have this guy on are you down with it I thought I I've heard that name but I don't know who is that and I was like oh is that the Teddy Atlas podcast guy oh wait what's the story and I as I started looking into it to me there was a few things that really stood out so there's the kind of the obvious headline that here's a guy who's over 50 years old and is basically flying through these marathons they're running super fast speeds I don't know the exact records or whatnot but you're one of the fastest if not the fastest corrected you're kind of in your brand over 50. yep yeah so that's kind of remarkable and I think that's you know that's the key thing I want to get to is like that's an extraordinary thing and that doesn't just come out of nowhere and so uh you talk about being able to go to that place at the last five miles what happens pre-race where do you where how do you flip that switch what is your sort of like um uh mental state of mind or your psyche what do you do mentally to prep yourself before these races those are great questions and thank you for the opportunity to explain this because I think that it's um important for people to understand when they look at this just on the surface like you just described like wow it's extraordinary and by the way when I hear it it doesn't even seem like you're talking about me so I I I I don't at times have the highest opinion on myself because of the struggles I've gone through with addiction so as I'm telling you this I'm super conscious that about coming across like a narcissist I don't want to come across like that I want to be I want to be very humble in how I describe this but I'm going to be honest with the process prior to the race I've spent before a race and this one in particular not no different than any other I spent 10 or 12 weeks like devoting all my physical energy or or at least 90 minutes to two and a half hours a day of preparing for this for let's say 12 weeks when I get to Tokyo the week before I always go by myself my wife I have four young children even some of the local Races they don't come to even when I think oh I'm gonna win and you can see me win a race like they've come to a few of them and it's kind of uneventful for them they come to expect me to win and I in my mind think they're going to be so psyched when they see me win and then they're like okay Dad can we get out of here now and get a donut so um anyway long-winded way to say I have a very um uh very specific process that I have to go through in the days leading up and again I don't want to sound like I'm like some Elite professional Runner but this is how this is what I do this is the process I have to get there in the case of Tokyo with a 14 15 hour time change I need to get there at least seven days early to get my body and my circadian rhythm on track with what I'm about to do because again I've spent 12 weeks devoting so much energy to this I don't want to mess around when I get there it's very specific I don't make plans to go to dinner with people or very rarely mainly because I'm a jerk I know it I'm very selfish to me again I'm not a pro Runner but to me this is my version of the Olympics and I am not there to mess around and have fun it's uh like I'm I'm on a work trip so I get there and I just need to be alone by myself think about what I want to do try to stay positive uh I'm a big believer in mindset and and what you tell yourself is the truth reality doesn't matter like what other people think about you does it matter it's the only thing that matters what you think of yourself and that goes into the same that same thought process goes into preparing for this race in my mind I am a professional Runner and I'm going to win the you know Olympic gold medal on Sunday so I get there early I go through my process and on race day I've said this before in interviews it's like I'm not I'm nothing nice on race day I don't want to make friends I don't want to chit chat I don't I'm a jerk I know it so I try to stay completely by myself I don't put my [ __ ] on other people but I don't want them putting theirs on me either so I stay by myself the race goes off I know what's coming some people are like how are the sites in Tokyo what were the people like in the race I said I couldn't tell you if we ran through the friggin Imperial Palace or not all I know is the road in front of me and I get into like a tunnel vision where I can't see any I mean I obviously if I look around I could but I don't waste an ounce of energy I don't even try to look at my watch for I don't want to move any movement that isn't completely necessary to get from A to B as quickly as possible I'm trying to run the straightest line I'm focusing if people get too close to me I'll like kind of give them and I'm like dude you're getting too close like I don't want to trip someone at the start of the race in Tokyo I was on right on the start line at two or three people right in front of me toppled and it was like they were caught in the whitewashes Surfers just arms and legs flailing elbows and knees smashing on the ground as people just trample them at the front of a major Marathon it was crazy so I don't want them doing that to me so I'm like that's what I meant about being a bit Alpha at the start but I don't want to hurt anyone I don't want to affect anyone but I don't want to be effed with either um and uh did I see uh did I see a picture of of you and Jason calcanus over there yeah I mean Jake Jacob yeah it's my dude how do you know him Kate my friend Casey neistat who is uh do you know who he is uh YouTube uh Casey so I trained Casey last year for the New York Marathon my friend Neve Schulman who's the host of Catfish on MTV he connected us so I trained Jason and uh not Jason uh Casey and Neve for New York City marathon and then I heard Jason mentioning um running a marathon on on all in and I just mentioned it in passing to Casey Casey connected me I saw Jason was in it with connected via text I saw Jason was in Tokyo I sent him a text and then we ended up going to dinner one night and then a Tokyo food tour the next day we went to like some super high-end sushi place and then a bakery and Jay Cal is like he's dialed he knows where he wants to go I know nothing hey I was just like just tell me where we're going and I'll be there just text me the address um that's what I mean about the week you're in the crowd you're you're hanging out with all the all the cool guys again when I think about my friends like Andrew huberman and David Sinclair and Joe Rogan I think I can't believe these guys are my friends I'm I I feel like the luckiest person in the world and I'm so humbled and honored that guys like you want to talk to me it's just mind-blowing but it comes back to this point of I don't have anything that anyone listening to this show doesn't have I promise you I'm not a good athlete I play division three Sports I was just a hustler and when I found running as a way of getting over an addiction issue with opio opioids I just decided I was done being mediocre and we'll get into the career stuff and I'll tell you how I did applied the same practice to my career in finance but at the end of the day you know not again not to sound cliche but if you're not all in there's just too many competitors out there that are going to eat your lunch if you don't bring your A game every day but when you do dedicate your 100 effort to one particular goal it's very hard to beat the guy who wants to die to win and that's kind of what I applied to running and and it's attracted these other kind of people that recognize that I am like serious about the things that I get involved in well the thing that you're interesting is the you just have an interesting life did I read did you used to work at Enron no good question I I was working in finance my very first job if you want me to kind of walk through my career I don't want to like jump around I started in I moved to New York right after I graduated college I had a pharmaceutical sales job for a few months but when I moved to New York I saw all these younger guys my age working in finance and making a ton of money and I was like I was making like thirty six thousand dollars in my like rent and student loans came to more than my take-home pay I was basically like living on borrowed time in New York living in a shitty walk up and um long story short I was playing uh pick up ice hockey at Chelsea Piers and a French Canadian kid who played uh minor league hockey asked me if I wanted a job as a um like a trading assistant on a on an inter-deal or brokerage desk brokering uh electricity trades between the utilities and Enron was one of those clients and the way it worked was the junior guys at Enron would trade like next day power which was like the commission was like literally like five dollars but if you didn't do that as a service for these accounts they weren't going to trade the like big ticket items with you so long story short I was doing that the guys on the trading desk you know back in like the late 90s trading desk was like a locker room it was very like Alpha driven um a lot of hazing and [ __ ] but I mean I was at the time boxing for the New York Athletic Club I had played hockey I mean I was I worked in a prison for four years so these nerds were hazing me and one day I just cuffed the guy I just slapped him across the face and almost knocked him out of his seat and needless to say they fired me but I was covering these young guys at Enron and they told the senior Traders what had happened and one of the senior traders who happened to be from Mazda's Vineyard outside of Boston called me up said hey I got a job I didn't even know we had competitors that's how naive I was I didn't know the other brokerage shops I was there like two months and um I mean I barely knew what a bitten an offer was what were and um this other competitor offered me a job starting the next Monday I was making 40 Grand they offered me a job at 80 grand I mean to me that was more money than anyone I knew made so I was like and the other thing is this guy's hazing me I had a huge black guy from a flight at the New York Athletic Club like I was not like a punk that you could just like I didn't strike you come across as like Hey Bully me I'm a big [ __ ] like I was a guy you know so when he did it I was like you got the wrong guy dude and I cracked him and needless to say he almost started crying because I was like when you leave this office I'm gonna beat that crap out of you and he's like I'm not I'm not gonna leave I go you're gonna have to sleep here because when you come outside you're getting a beaten and they were like okay Ken you got to go before we call the clops and again I had no safety net I couldn't call home and ask for money that was like I work in the prison my stepdad and brother were inmates in the prison no one was looking to help me in my finance career in New York to them I was like an anomaly you know I was already like the richest person they knew just by having a job in New York City so um yeah it was nerve-wracking and uh so that's how my career started and the guys at Enron were just like good customers of my clients that like literally changed my life but it worked out all right I mean I think at the end of your career I mean you're killing it yeah so so when that happened I mean when from the minute that happened within two years I was making like I mean not again not sound like a narcissist and I don't have a lot of money I don't I'm not a rich guy but within two years I was making like two million dollars a year doing things that to me were like I didn't even know what we were trading I just knew people and I had relationships and they were just doing trades with me I was living in London I was running uh I ran sales and trading commodity sales and trading at Kenner Fitzgerald out of London in Hong Kong and I was flying on the Concorde back and forth from New York to London on a regular basis every single time the novelty like just never wore off every time it happened I was like I can't believe that this is my life much like I feel today I can't believe I've done this how are you making that much money that's just commissions or uh yeah so what goes into that how do you jump from like 80k to 2 million what what happened yeah good question so um I was brokering um electricity trades and electricity deregulation had just taken place so you're putting together trades for like Commodities trade on monthly contracts so we were doing that and um when Enron went went bust I got basically sent from New York from at London back to New York because the business had dried up but I was like one of the biggest producers of commissions at the time again like I was so unqualified I didn't know anything about the technicalities of what we were doing I just knew how to find buyers and sellers it could have been houses it could have been baseball cards I just was had a knack for it is that like so when networking is it cold calling what were you what were you doing to actually be great what did it take to be great there yeah good question I hate the word networking I feel like when you're trying to network you're already like us behind the curve like if you're trying to make friends people ask me frequently now like how are you friends with Rich Roll and and uh Andrew and I'm like I don't know I just I I must have something that they like and they have something I like we just find each other but I certainly didn't make a conscious effort ever to be friends with anyone it's just a natural process so to answer your question I just had I just had an ability to connect with people and I tried to have live a life of honesty and integrity and if I say I'm gonna do something I'll do it and I like to tell the people that I'm close with or when I have a close friend someone's like oh are you friends with that guy I'm like oh I'd help that guy bury a dead body I like him so much like that's my guy you know and I think that people know people that are my friends know that that's the truth if you need me someone's coming to over to your house they want to fight with you I'll come and help you like and I think like I said I think the people who are tight with me they know that that's a character trait that I have and I think it's what's helped me build the rapport with the people that I've built rapport with um but to your question um so I had this ability to connect with people so when Enron went bust they sent me back to New York and again talking about Reinventing yourself Enron goes down I'm making a ton of money and these businesses like Tanner Fitzgerald investment Banks Etc they're ruthless so the minute [ __ ] went sideways with electricity trading they were like okay we'll send you back to New York and this was I lived in London during 9 11 and Canada was on the top floor of the World Trade Center so when we lost 3 000 people they sent me back to New York and said hey can you take over our credit derivatives business which happened to be the most lucrative business in the in the institution at the time now if I didn't know anything about electricity you can imagine how little I knew about credit derivatives I knew less than nothing I knew as much as a plumber wouldn't it but I knew people and I knew the lingo and I just I picked up the phone and just in hindsight I don't even know I had a I developed a relationship with a guy who's still one of my really good friends called Colin Stewart who worked at Morgan Stanley who happened to be a huge Trader of these things and then Market was so new credit derivatives and we just hit it off again just became friendly we went skiing a couple times and um he started to just do a ton of business with me and at the time when a product is new the commissions tend to be big until people realize how much they're paying on an annual monthly or annual basis but I can remember one time for context and again I'm only sharing these numbers because of the the context of the podcast I I don't want to come across like hey look how much money I'm making because hey our podcast is called it's called my first millionaire all right all right so I'm on a trading desk there's a group of credit derivative Brokers just generic credit derivatives I was trading credit derivative like correlation products like super sophisticated high-end bespoke one-off trades so the credit derivative desk has like 12 guys and that was like the product du jour everyone wanted to be in credit derivatives it was jam and they were credit derivative basically think of it as an option on a bond so these guys would jam in and we had a super busy day one day everyone did and the kid who ran the CDs credit default swap death says to me dude we had a huge day we made 250 000 in commissions between like 10 15 guys so I said hold on let me see and I start telling everything I go oh dude I I was a one-man show I said I did uh 262 000 in total commissions and I think I was keeping like either 50 or 60 of that in one day ha amazing uh it was insane and so how did you how did you leave that why how do you let that go or you know what happened yeah take us yeah continue the story all right so when I went to London I was in charge of like a bunch of grown men and and I was like 27 years old but I was very immature like when I went to college I've said in previous interviews like I I wasn't prepared for adulthood I I just I grew up around junkies and degenerates and like it was a very hectic childhood and my brother was in and out my brother never went to school past the ninth grade he's only 11 months younger than me so it was just total chaos where I was and I just knew I had to get out of this so I applied to college like I literally went to the school I went to because on the application you could like fill in the little dots with the pencil next to the letters and it was like like path of least resistance in terms of applications and I could work it and I had a job offer to work as a guard in the prison full-time in the summer and then a few days a week during the school year which I did through college I started at the prison like when I was uh one week out of high school so if you can imagine being in a men's Maximum Security Prison I mean I was 18 but I probably looked like I was 15. but I also knew prison is very segregated right blacks and whites don't necessarily mingle with each other freely it's not like it's it's like a different world but I knew most of the white guys because I grew up in like white Irish Catholic almost like not in housing projects my whole life but in that in that sphere so when I got there I knew some of those guys so I wasn't as scared as I might be if I didn't know anyone going in there which I know sounds crazy in hindsight now people know me like you knew people in prison I'm like the difference between guards and inmates is like the inmates have been caught the guards are just as bad it's like that was that was a big part of my motivation to get out of college it's like looking at what my prospects of Life looked like if I didn't go to college and working at that prison I was like I'd rather be dead it was the worst worst to this day it's the worst experience of my life just in the thought of having to do that every day for 20 years so um I'm working there paying through college I'm I go to London I'm now in charge of basically in in on a brokerage desk whoever makes the most commissions they're the manager regardless of having management skills so I guess what I was saying in a long-winded way of saying like I had no experience or no I didn't have the maturity to be a manager so I really didn't know what I was doing but I knew I was good at brokering trades and I was suffering massively like from a fraud complex imposter syndrome and I had a minor surgery on my ankle I was introduced to Percocet and the minute I took those Percocets and the opioids I was like oh I have all the confidence in the world no one can stop me and thus began like a 10-year Odyssey of being high 24 7. save for like a week or two here a month here and there like I'd get sober on my own just White Knuckle it like go through the physical withdrawals of you know basically opioids just like heroin I was I was a mess like in hindsight I I tell people now when I speak to like junkies at like n a meetings like AAA meetings I speak at prisons I say like I was a good drug addict I could get away with it I had resources I was resourceful I could find drugs anywhere I could get people to give me prescriptions all over the country I just I'm embarrassed to say I was really good at it and I was a functioning addict for a good 10 years and I'm sure people that worked with me during those during that period just think I was [ __ ] crazy not necessarily whacked on drugs but it is what it is it's embarrassing like I'm I I get choked up thinking about it because I I just can't believe I behaved like such a loser and um but I did it and um and once I finally um got sober um when we started when I I started having children with my wife I have an adopted daughter who's 12 years old from we adopted her from Ethiopia as a newborn and right before we adopted her I just went through like an outpatient detox got clean and have been sober since I mean I haven't been without slip UPS over the last several years like I might you know slip up here in there but I mean for the most part I've been sober longer than I've ever been in my life and it's um you know it's like of all the things I've ever done it's the one of the things that I'm most proud of the fact that I was able to um kind of I don't say get over because it's a constant struggle to stay sober when you've been addicted to those kind of drugs they're so physically and and um mentally addictive um but nevertheless it is that that's kind of my journey but um where'd the transition go from just being a normal guy to this kind of I don't know personality or whatever you want to call what you are now yep that's what I was going to get to so in 2010 when I got sober I started doing um triathlons I did the Iron Man in Hawaii three times it was your first time or what was what what time did you finish in your first uh Triathlon uh probably 11 hours and then oh you broke 12 hours your first time yeah yeah but that's like that again that goes back to mentality like oh my God by the way Sean that's like pretty good I mean 12 hours sounds like a very long time somebody's number no breaking 12 hours for your first time that's like uh that's a that's a great accomplishment right pretty good in like three years I got down to a 936 basically without even knowing how to swim and I went to Hawaii three times but again part of that Journey was like learning about myself and figuring out how to suffer and learning that quitting is much harder than suffering because the first time I went to Hawaii to me it was like I had um made it to the Olympics and I was so happy just to be there that when when I got off the bike you know it's two and a half miles swim in the ocean 112 mile bike ride in the Hawaii sun in the Heat and you start a marathon around one o'clock in the afternoon which would be crazy even even to do as a training run and um The Run got hard and I just quit I just stopped I was like I'm dying this isn't my day of like I I just told myself every story that I needed to tell myself to justify quitting it's been a long year of training you made it here that's the big thing and as I walked back to transition literally like crying to myself like crying like real tears like it just it's so shameful because I knew I didn't have to quit I had a lot more to get even if I walked and um I went back the next year and finished in like 9 hours and 39 minutes which was you know I don't know where I finished overall but that that was it I was very satisfied with that and that process of so so I used the Endurance Sports to deal with my addiction and then through Endurance Sports I discovered my an ability to suffer through adversity and I also learned the pain of quitting and the emptiness that I felt when I didn't give a hundred percent to something that I had committed to and um and that really began the journey so that was like in 2012 or 13 where I was like you know what I'm done being mediocre at anything in life I'm whatever I do I'm gonna do with a hundred percent conviction including work and if you're like I'm happy to come back to like my career and how I transitioned into what it was into what it is because this is all part of the same story well let's stay with the with the Mind shift so I want to talk about two of them so you had said kind of like uh we adopted my daughter and I decided to get sober and you know uh made a decision but what what was the thought uh because you know after 10 years of addiction I can't imagine that that was just that was the worst addiction yeah opioid I mean they're the worst and so I can't imagine that that was just so as simple as saying okay okay well now I'm this time I'm gonna do it so what what was the thought and do you can you take us back to that moment where you kind of realized okay I'm gonna do this or was it many false starts before it finally happened how did it happen yeah no that's an excellent point that there were many false thoughts no one who's suffering with addiction wants to continue to wallow in that because they call those uh medication Percocet like painkillers but they're really Joy Killers so it what happens is you initially take them you feel great and you can maybe do that for like a week and every single time you take a a dose you get a euphoric feeling maybe the first time for an hour or two by the end of the first week it might be a half an hour by the time you're in this Rose of addiction you're only taking them so you're not sick and I mean anyone who knows anything about withdrawals from opioids knows like I'm talking imagine having the worst flu of your life for seven freaking days and it can stop whenever you're ready to start taking them again or are you strong enough to get through this week to 10 days so then again just like quitting at anything you're sick oh something came up any justification where you're like I can't afford to show up here in like the throws of withdrawals I like can't go two feet from the toilet because I might have to use the bathroom I'm sweating then I'm freezing cold everything hurts I'm an emotional mess I could try it like a drop of a dime and um so there had been many I had gotten sober for weeks and months at a time and then you know found excuses to go back to using but when we were adopting my children I was like I cannot live like this with children I have to be in my right mind I I and yeah it was in his so to your point it's not just like I just switched this uh a switch flipped the switch but I will say in terms of being hard finding someone that's been able to get sober from opioids is like finding someone like with a story like from The Biggest Loser where you see someone who weighs like 350 400 pounds then the next time you see them they're ripped to shreds and they're living like an athletic lifestyle that's I think how rare it is to find someone who was heavily addicted to opioids and is now living a clean and prosperous emotionally prosperous life that's how I feel it's it's it's so hard and only other junkies who've been through this can recognize the struggle that went into it and the strength that it took to get out of it like I said I've not always been perfect but I'm so grateful and thankful to be where I am for us is where I was with regards to the addiction but yeah it was not it it I know I'm Different I know when it comes to mindset I know that I have some mental strength that other people don't have I say that with humility but it's the truth I I just decided I'd rather die than live like this and I don't want to die I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out-of-sync spreadsheets serve dueling databases HubSpot grow better you have an interesting perspective because you grew up with a bunch of people that are now in prison and you weren't in a prison then you worked in uh in New York on Wall Street but uh now you know a lot of these like uh you know these celebrity Fitness folks so you have like a you know a bunch of interesting people and you also work with Teddy Atlas which I imagine through that you've been able to meet Tyson and it looks like you have Dustin Poirier on the on on your behind your shoulder on a picture of him so you've met a lot of like traditionally tough people or at least people who from an outsider's perspective from my perspective are like these tough guys who are some of the toughest people that you've met and you admire when you think about how would this person behave in this situation when I'm struggling physically or mentally I would think one of the toughest people I know I don't want to get emotional one of the toughest people I know is my wife the fact that she was able to like stick with me through all this [ __ ] for the for the sake of my children has been uh incredible it's easy to be physically tough because like I said I mean he catching a beat in his like okay I got beat up like okay not the end of the world we've all been falling down a bike crash car accident whatever like physical pain is just momentary emotional pain lasts forever someone that's able to withstand emotional pain and show toughness and perseverance through emotional pain is a special person because like I said with like using addiction as an example there's a lot of ways to escape emotional pain drugs alcohol ultimately they're all shortcuts and um you know like a finger in the dike of the problem like the only way through it the only way to deal with adversity is to go through it and go through the fire you know like uh the expression When You're Going Through Hell keep going or you're in a hole stop digging So to that extent in terms of emotional toughness my wife showed incredible um conviction and perseverance to stick with me when I was just of a mediocre Finance clown addicted to drugs behaving like an [ __ ] worrying about materialistic possessions and worrying about keeping up with the Joneses versus worry about just living for myself and trying to be the best person that I could be which in my heart is like who I really am and um so to that extent my wife is tough but you know in terms of traditional toughness I'd say any of the fighters we've had on the podcast that's um Dustin over one shoulder in our Regis over this Regis program who's um 140 pound world champion um those are two incredibly tough guys but anyone who has the courage to get into the ring or the octagon and have a fist fight for money in front of other people can you imagine anything physically tougher than that I just I have such those guys how do those guys describe that I mean like this weekend I don't know how many people bought the Jon Jones fight but I imagine he had millions of eyeballs on him he's like well I'm gonna get in my underwear I'm gonna basically I'm basically naked and I'm like gonna fight to the death in front of all these people that's right I and like I've read some like Channel sun in and cowboy Cerrone they're like backstage they you they're these tough guys and they like at the weigh-ins they're puffing their chest and they're flexing their muscles and they're like I'm gonna F and kill you yada yada but then they'll tell stories once they're retired they're like I had to throw up in the backstage ahead of that fight because I was so afraid and at the beginning of every fight it's just like a race you have these feelings of like what am I doing I don't want to do this why do I keep doing this what am I like this is the worst feeling and so they're kind of human but what do you think or what have some of those people said right before they're about to get in the the arena and just fight to the death what's that what do they go through you just hit the nail on the head I've had some fights myself uh boxing matches and it's whether you're in the UFC or fighting in a um a VFW or a convention hall every single person that I've ever met and spoken to and I've been in the locker room of Fighters before fights many world champions UFC boxers Teddy and I trained the light heavyweight champion of the world I was basically Teddy's assistant Teddy trained him but we were in the locker room for a pay-per-view Main Event fight and I can tell you every single person feels the same things that you and I would feel or that average person would feel they're not different they're not special they're not unique the coward and the hero as Teddy Alice would say they feel the same exact thing the only thing that they do differently is how they behave some people let that fear oval overwhelm them and they cower and like I I I I I compare it to like surfing the waves are crashing down and there's that like break Zone where you either have to get out of the water or get through the break and the coward either gets washed out the sea or goes back to the shore and the hero goes through the break and knows that on the other side is calm Waters and is the place where you want to be with other Heroes so I think to answer your question is they don't feel any different everyone feels the same thing they're not immune to the fact that there's millions of people watching no one is it's just exactly as you would imagine the only difference is how they behave and you just forget her that the what this reason they train you train as hard as you do or they do is because at the end of the day you've got to block out all the [ __ ] because all that fear that we we've just described is all noise and the the amount of things and again this is all knowledge I have gleaned from working with Teddy Atlas all of the scenarios and potential nightmares that could happen Teddy calls them like the ninjas of your mind the ninja stop coming over the wall as you're getting ready to go into the Ring of the octagon and all of the possible scenarios endless scenarios of things that could go horribly wrong you could die you could get knocked out you could get your arm broken but at the end of the day what are the odds of any of those things happening because you know you've trained like a dog you've been in fires with these kind of sparring sessions you've done the running you've done the training and at the end of the day you have to block out the fact that everyone's watching this is now simply a more aggressive sparring session and you've just got to focus on the task at hand and once at least in my own experience whether it's a fight or a race once the gun goes off or the bell rings and you start jabbing or running you have to get your mind into that place of like hey I've been here before I know what's coming I know what to do even if it's not going right I know how I'm supposed to behave and Teddy would say you know the difference what makes a fighter a fighter or what makes a fight a fight is when there's something to overcome you're not really a fighter if you're just in there beating the brakes out of [ __ ] competition you become a fighter when there's something to overcome when you adult some cards that you weren't expecting when you get punched in the most in a shot that you didn't see coming and now you're tested that's when you see who's really a fighter who can come back who can get off the canvas we measure a man much more by how they get off the canvas versus how many times they knock someone else to the canvas so when you have losses and setbacks and you've experienced that feeling of having quit or not given a hundred percent that's when you find out who you really are and that's at least that's what's worked for me and again a lot of reality the reality of situation isn't nearly as important as the narrative that you have in your head because the narrative in your head is going to control how you behave and control your mindset and that's something that's well within your control and you can learn how to harness that ability over time and through practice and that's why we train the way we do so I wanted to ask you about that exact thing because uh you know not you've you run and you run these crazy marathons in these crazy times I think basically just been getting faster and faster every year you know every year since you were 35 years old which is kind of amazing I'm not gonna run I'm not a runner it's not something that's of interest to me but everybody hits adversity so I think this is probably the most important thing that I want to learn from you which is uh when you whether you're in a fight or you're in a race and adversity strikes what is the self-talk that you have developed that gets you through that because uh you said the difference between like a coward and the hero is the behavior but I think the behavior I would guess comes from a conversation in that happens in your head deciding which way are we going to go are we going to walk off the field or are we going to continue on right um and so what is that self-talk and how do you train that yeah that's a great point and um I think that at the end of the day we all know what the answer is I like try to use a professional analogy like a business analogy if you're a research analyst right and you're covering a particular stock and you know that there's like let's say realistically 15 other guys covering that stock is like who's gonna go the extra mile to get it done right we've all just like at the start of race everyone shows up everyone there is good everyone there is fit who's the healthiest that's a big difference who's done all the little things so if you're doing research have you uncovered every every stone have you turned over every stone like um Warren Buffett talks about that he would pour through company reports I don't even think he uses a computer he's just old school he's just reading reading company reports reading balance sheets and I think that we all know whether it whatever our profession is we all know what we could do better and I think when you sit with yourself and you ask yourself have I done everything think about how much free time how much time we waste in the day and and if you need an example every single time you open your phone and look at it for anything Instagram Twitter I do it myself it pisses me off because it's such a waste of time I've like contemplated getting rid of social media every day for like the last two years but it's it it I would be lying if I didn't say it's been helpful me to me in terms of getting my message out there and kind of sharing some of the knowledge I have in terms of what I've been able to do with running but I would say that to simplify is like we all know what needs to be done you just have to do the little extra things that you know that other people aren't is someone else leaving early to go have drinks with their friend the people who are great that's their priority and again back to the concept of all in if you're all in on one thing and you decide there's one thing that no one's going to beat me at no one has to tell you what you need to do you know everyone you know spend more time doing the thing that you love doing if you do something more than anyone else I'm pretty sure you'll become the best in the world that if you want to be the best piano player there's going to be people that are just virtuosos so let's take out the outliers but if you want to be a piano player and and there's 20 other people in your class I promise you that if you train more than them and practice more than them you'll be the best and I unfortunately the only example I have about for me is running um I've just run more than other people and I've been able to stay healthy which is you know I get maybe part of it is luck I just have the physiology that absorbs the miles but I do a lot of other things to maintain my overall health in addition to running you you keep saying that you're like this you're like I'm a humble guy you know and it feels crazy well you don't say I'm humble I think you said I don't want to be a narcissist and talk about this and that but you kind of are like this Alpha cocky guy in a good way that's a compliment uh because I read this story and he you just you're a funny guy you're like you're like the character you're like the real life version of mar of a Mark Wahlberg character in a movie because you say these these these funny Wise Cracks because I read the story that's like 10 years old apparently Lance Armstrong was hosting like a man camp or some type of like you know like tough guy camp and uh I think the story is is that like you were kind of chirping at him you're like uh I came this close you told the the reporter I came this close to beating Lance Armstrong in the first race I attacked him like a rabbit dog I had a gap on him and then on the ride apparently a rock hit Lance or something from one someone's tires and you said I heard Lance Armstrong I broke him I made him bleed and then you actually uh you got close to beating him or maybe even did beat him and he said I'm the winner of man camp Lance I need you to clean my bike and hose it off for me yes yeah the initial quote says slightly out of context because it sounds a bit like a dork like I would never be like I came this close to beat him I just would never talk like that there was more to the quote or I was and I did beat him in a couple of those clients but he probably hadn't written bike in like six months before we did this together so like there's a lot of context that's missed in there but Lance is a good friend of mine a rock did bounce up and hit his finger and I said yep I made you bleed now clean all the bikes we kicked your ass and uh and then I probably said to him make sure that no one gets a blood sample that uh make sure no one gets a drop of that blood and runs a sample on it I don't want to find out that you're still doing any kind of performance enhancers but it was obviously set in jest but but you're you're chirping at them in a fun way but even like even that you had the confidence to chirp at him a little bit I think it's hilarious and awesome why wouldn't I he's a bike rider have you ever met a bike rider that was gonna physically like do anything to anyone I was like I think at some point I said to him like you're used to dealing with like 115 pound European cyclists now you're dealing with real men like this is where peers there's no like you know what I mean I can't imagine a less intimidating group of guys than professional cyclists sounds like you better took Lance to band camp actually instead of him yeah classes in session that day the other thing is if someone heard all the conversations out of context number one they wouldn't be fit to be published they were like very um much like a locker room but Lance is my buddy and and all of that set stuff was just said and just and teasing each other that probably wouldn't all be for public consumption but um you know I I anytime you see quotes where it's like that like I came this close to being Lance it makes me sound like a [ __ ] dork and like I wouldn't talk like that I would have said I'm gonna kick your ass and when we get out there tomorrow I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna do that but again I would say that too I'd tell Dustin Poirier the same thing if we were going to have a sparring session I just that's but that's all and I I don't I don't want to sound I I don't at all I don't feel cocky or arrogant whatsoever I know that there's some things I'm good at and I know that there's a lot more things that I'm bad at so if I've come across this cocky I apologize it's certainly not the message I want to send I I think I tried to be as humble as I can and know that there's a lot of things that I'm not good at but suffering is one thing that I know how to do are you making most of your income right now from your main I think you have like a like a small advisory right are you making most of your income now from that or are you and are you going to try and go full transition to become like this I don't know what the right word is what we call these Goggins but whatever that is a personality that sounds like Lamer than it actually is but you know what I mean yeah I know um that's a great question so I've made the most of my income through finance and um what I've done so so in 2015 I left New York I went to California with a fintech startup um called electronify we were brokering trades between um institutions for corporate bonds so right now when you trade a corporate bond you have to call like Goldman Morgan Stanley and you have to find they they you tell them I want to sell these balloons they find a buyer sometimes they'll buy them from you which was the old traditional Investment Bank model right they hey I got 20 20 million of these bonds to go okay we'll take them there and then they try to sell them at a slight markup now they're basically just matching buyers and sellers for all intensive so we created a new uh an electronic Marketplace that could let these like Fidelity and Pimco trade directly with each other so I went out to new I went out to LA to cover the West Coast knowing that there was a good chance that this startup wasn't going to work it didn't we sold it to a competitor but I my by moving to La I basically forced myself into an uncomfortable position because there aren't sales and trading jobs in La like there are in New York so I knew I'd have to figure something else out and you know that expression of like hey if you're waiting for everything to be perfect to make a move it ain't ever going to happen you have to make the move and make it perfect and long story short I was riding my bike out everything that good in my life that's happened has been through Endurance Sports I was riding my bike with a guy on my neighborhood and we were um he ran an asset management firm called the Palisades group and they had maybe two billion in assets under management they were running money for all big household managers like all the household names like Apollo for instance and and they had separately managed accounts so the fees weren't huge like a traditional hedge fund or asset manager and I said to him he didn't have a uh um any business development he wasn't actively out there trying to raise more Capital which is what he would need to do to really grow his business so I said let me run business development for you and and he said you know accurately you don't have any experience and we're friends I don't want to put you in a losing position and I said okay I'll work for free for three months just to see if it works and again every time I've been willing to take a bet on myself it's worked out in that in that brokerage commission role that we discussed earlier I was paid just straight commission so when I was making all that money if I didn't do any trades I don't make any money but because I was willing to do that I got to keep more of the commissions so anytime I've been on myself it's worked thankfully so he gave me an opportunity and I came in and in two years we grew that from two billion to 5 billion I raised uh two discretionary funds which is basically like raising a hedge fund first time manager managing discretionary Capital we couldn't even hire Banks to help us raise the money they basically laughed us out of the room and I said they said to me you think why do you think and I they said why do you think you can raise this fund like it doesn't seem like you'll be able to just based on the track record experienced asset class and I said why do you think you can't like until someone beats me at the New York Marathon like I'll convince myself that I can win this whole race and long story short we raised the money we raised a 35 million dollar fund and 150 million dollar fund and once I did that and kind of started to believe in myself that I could raise money my boss at the time who's like one of my best friends Jack McDowell who's like okay like just go off and go off and do this on your own he said dude you're wasting your time go do your own thing and the first mandate that I worked on was with um David Sinclair at a life biosciences I helped them raise 50 million dollars at one point David and I were raising capital in New York and we had dinner with um Wendy Murdock and um Tony Blair and Bennett Miller at Wendy's like uh New York City Triplex apartment of Fifth Avenue it was literally like I was watching someone's else's life unfold as I was sitting there having a conversation with Tony Blair over dinner and um so once I had once I had raised money for a few different independent uh private placement mandates I just started doing that full time and have since worked on a bunch of um mandates in the health and wellness space and now I'm back raising a um on a consultant basis raising a third discretionary fund for the Palisades group and um so that's kind of one way that I make money I also have some invest I've invested in a lot of these deals I have some advisory roles um I mean I guess for lack of better terms some influencer deals um with some big brands that have been you know I just feel so incredibly lucky that Brands want to affiliate with me it's like a dream come true and then I also have a TV project I'm working on what's the next like five years gonna be how's this transition going to look like and what do you want it to look like well in a perfect world I just filmed a pilot um with a big production company for a network that's um confidential right now but if if the network likes what we recorded and I think they will it's unbelievable I think a lot of people will like it it's a non-scripted kind of show um with where I'm ho I'm the Hope Maine host and um in a perfect world the network will like the show pick it up and I will do that and see where that takes me but I I like the idea I always tell people like when you work for someone else when you're employed you're kind of a slave like they own you you can't just do whatever you want to do you get to have a couple days off a week they provide a little bit of safety for you and in turn you give them like x amount of your time but the main thing that you miss out on by being an employee is you miss out on the opportunity to pursue interesting opportunities when they are presented like this media project I'm working on if I had a job there's no way I'd be able to do it because they were like Hey we're going to record for a week and you know out of town I would never have been able to do this but because I was willing to bet on myself and you know take the risk of having to get my own health insurance not being sure if like you know something happens to me and people don't want to be affiliated with me anymore I get injured I can't run like okay now it's what I do I guess I could always fall back on a finance gig but I don't want to do that I wasn't happy doing that and to that point I've said this before and I think it's relevant for this podcast is that I've said to people like money doesn't make you happy and people are always like oh [ __ ] you have money and I'm like no I've had money and lost money multiple times when Enron went bust you know when you're making a lot of money you spend a lot of money and when that ends abruptly you very quickly out of money especially if you have a ten twelve thousand dollar mortgage and now you get paid getting paid 10 grand a month which is what happened to me when Enron went bust things can change quickly and the reason I say the example I give you is I was making a ton of money and I became a drug addict so it didn't make me happier it caused me different anxiety so money can alleviate a lot of stress but it can also add stress that you didn't know stressors that you didn't even know existed and yes it's easier to have money than to not have money but if your only goal in life is to make money I would say be careful what you wish for because I was making money and I could have convi I could have comfortably continued to do what I was doing but I'm so much happier now wearing the risk of not knowing where the next deal or paycheck is going to come from but I've never been happier in my life and and this didn't this transformation didn't happen until my late 40s and when I finally like had the courage to battle myself full like all in in my late 40s it's been the greatest gift I've ever given myself is to like bet on myself and and and and live and die with my own results so in five years I hope that this Media stuff becomes more of a reality and I can continue to kind of share my experiences and um you know knowledge of you know knowing how to suffer and deal with adversity and uh I like I like sharing that message I've done some speaking recently that's also contributed to uh my financial well-being and that's something that I actually really enjoy which is crazy right because every time I do speak to people I go hey is anyone here get nervous about speaking in front of an audience and every single person raises their hand and I go guess what I do too but I'm dealing with it and like I tell my kids it's okay to be scared like when they my youngest son's playing baseball he's like Dad I get so nervous when I get up to batty seven I said buddy everybody does but sometimes we just have to learn how to do things while we're scared once you get comfortable uh operating while you're scared you can't lose it's just it has to do with repetitions and experience how are you so I'm a former competitive Runner now I'm I'm I just I'm pretty into fitness but all types of well-rounded Fitness stuff and I get hurt you seem like you do not get hurt is that and part of that I think is like just biology I think some people just built where they can absorb miles like you said but what are you doing to stay healthy um I try to sleep eight hours a day I eat a very healthy diet I do a lot of strength training that I think a lot of Runners don't do um and I do a lot of recently I hadn't done a lot of stretching and stuff in the past but lately I've been doing a lot more stretching and um I feel like it's especially in the last like six to 12 months tons of um preventative care electrical musculus I've got every like met device Under the Sun electrical muscular stimulation theragon etc etc it's been um I spent a lot of time trying to keep myself healthy but it gets getting harder over the years do you think that you know running 70 and 80 miles a week do you think that that's going to be that's going to make you a live a longer or healthier life or are you just happy to do you just like how it makes you feel because when I you know think about like some of these I did a half Ironman nothing like you did and I didn't even do it fast but I remember doing all these miles and I'm like man I don't know if this is gonna if this is gonna make me live to be 120 it might not like or maybe just like lifting weights and going for walks might be a little bit better but how do you think about that I agree with you 100 100 I always tell anyone who's interested I don't know that this is the answer for me but you're talking to someone who is living the life of a drug addict to me okay if it makes my life a little bit shorter but it's adding the quality of life that I'm experiencing right now that's a bet I'm willing to make um yeah I don't know like I wish I had an answer for you I don't know what's going to add to my overall longevity um in terms of my mental and physical well-being um but I know that right now this is the best way for me to live my life look at what it's given me has been it's been immeasurable um but I think that there are a lot of things that contribute to longevity I mean obviously there's the famous longevity study out of Harvard that suggests that the most important element to live in a healthy fruitful life is um relationships and um it's to that extent the one thing that this lifestyle and my kind of Newfound station in life has provided me is the quality of relationships when I worked in finance this doesn't apply to everyone in finance but a lot of the people I worked with were real [ __ ] and I didn't like them and it was keeping up with the Joneses and I if I never had to sit on a trading desk for the rest of my life I'd be perfectly fine with that um again not everyone I met some people there that I genuinely love but this is the most also some people there that if I saw them I wouldn't mind giving them a smack in the mouth there's been some real idiots I've worked with and I I could go on forever um but my life now when I if there's someone in my life that I don't appreciate or don't respect I can just cut them out and move on to the next thing I don't need the thing that I have that some billionaires don't have is enough I have enough I have everything I need and I'd love to have more money and I'd love to put in a pool and renovate my house and splurge on a lot of [ __ ] but at the end of the day I have the one thing that I need and that's enough and I have my family and um so you know Finding what you're finding something in life that you're passionatable and that you genuinely Joy enjoy is the key and to me and people say all the time find something you love doing and you'll never work a day in your life there isn't a single week that goes by that I don't say to my wife can you believe I don't have an effing job am I the luckiest person we know and she always laughs and goes you're definitely the luckiest person I know but it's interesting that the harder I work the luckier I seem to get you're an interesting guy and we appreciate you coming on your uh I've been following you now I think since 2020 whenever you joined Teddy Atlas yeah because I I listen to that a ton I know Sean knows too and so we appreciate you coming on your uh you're different you're built different you're a different guy and we appreciate that we like those types of people well I I want to say again thank you so much I really hope that I didn't come across as uh two alpha or cocky I just tried to be more than anything I tried to just be honest man is like the the the world and the internet is so big if you if you embellish or [ __ ] about something there'll be someone coming out of the bushes like that didn't happen and this didn't happen because I know a lot of my stuff sounds Sensational and crazy but I'm like I think if anything at times I'm downplaying some of the stuff because I know it's how crazy it sounds but um yeah anyway I I do feel very humbled and honored to be here this is a place where Cockiness and alphaness is actually appreciated so so even if you did that would be uh you know right at home here we just like when people are the way they are and not trying to be it's at home because by the way we don't get a lot of Cockiness or Alpha shot that's why we like it yeah we enjoy it it's a good change you know we're a business podcast for the most part entrepreneurship and uh you know we're a bunch of people with carpal tunnel syndrome you know it's not a bunch of Health males coming on the Pod uh typically uh so so you know I think there was some good stuff here for for mental strength toughness adversity you know basically uh what I think is the most important thing which is the little managing the little voice in your head and uh that little voice in your head you know that's who you you go through life with and I think that um you're a great example of what happens when you really like you know work on that and so so thanks for coming on again I really appreciate it I would say this before I leave like that voice in your head is not little that voice in your head is all all powerful the most powerful right it's the voice in my head is the one that tells me to get high when I know I shouldn't the voice in the head the little voice tells me to go run when it's pissing rain or freezing cold and snowing so that voice in your head shouldn't be little it should be big and it should be like screaming from a megaphone that you're the best and you can do anything you want to do and to your point if you have a bunch of carpal tunnel guys here that like might consider themselves nerds and like intellects good because the one thing that you can control is your physical actions anyone can do what I've done I promise you I'm not special I wish I had the intellect that some of these carpal tunnel guys because that's the one thing I don't have and that's where I'm trying to overcompensate by being so physical that maybe my intellectual shortcomings can be overcome through physical intimidation and uh alphanus but anyway I say that in chess but honestly everything that I have is available to anyone I'm just literally the only thing I'm doing different than most people is physically is trying harder well Sam I don't know about you but uh in 10 minutes I'm going to do my workout and I think it's going to be a good one today I think I got a little extra juice no I think you know it is but you gotta Follow You Gotta follow him on Instagram there's videos of him Shadow Boxing and uh right before he's about to go running or right after he got uh got done running and he uh I always feel foolish Post in that [ __ ] I really do and then I'm like no I like it I watch it because I like running a lot but I don't want a runner's body and you're you're you're cool because you don't have a runner's body my mission in life is to not look like a runner you're well-rounded you're well-rounded it doesn't matter if you're 53 or you're 23 you look you look you look good you know I always I joke I'm like the point of working out for me is uh to be able to uh kill or outrun everyone in a room you know you want to be able to kill it eat them or outrun them and we'll add a third thing which is you also want to look good naked and so in your and you're and you're and you're checklist it's check check check all right you're not gonna look good for yourself think about your spouse so that's kind of my closing Salvo all right you're the man thank you very much we appreciate that I appreciate you guys thank you for having me [Music] thank you

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
I told you I'm in content mode baby I'm writing and I'm I got some gems uh I'll give you the headline of something I'm writing right now I haven't even released this any of this stuff yet um but but it's called congratulations you climbed Mount stupid [Music] what's up fellas it's Friday how you guys doing doing great good good uh we're reacting to the news we got some good ones this week uh let's start with uh let's start with Jake Paul vs Tommy Fury uh Jake Paul of course the famous influencer uh has since become a professional boxer for the first time he lost a fight uh losing to uh Tommy Fury a professional boxer and social media influencer and uh not just the fight is notable but what's also notable is that Sam you basically called exactly what would happen in the fight uh so do you want to take your Victory lap right now Sam no I didn't call exactly but I have been getting good at predicting fights I'm a huge Combat Sports Fan um but I I didn't exactly get it but I loved it you know I know why I love it I love freak shows this was a freak Show and I am always going to pay for that pay-per-view and watch freak shows I thought it was awesome second I think if you're listening to this whether you're a man or a woman you should go and train boxing just for like three months and actually Spar not like Rumble where you're just hitting the bag but I think you should Spar and I'm not talking Spar like when you kick someone's ass or you get beat up because Sean you remember when we spared it doesn't hurt right if you do it with someone who like it doesn't have to hurt but well you know what it does it scares you it's a very get the heart rate up it gets the heart rate up it you if you do it right with someone who's been there done that you're not gonna get hurt I promise you're gonna get hurt by running more than you will actually sparring if you do it with someone who knows what they're doing but that like fight or flight response we never get that and so I love that he did that I find it very courageous that he actually stood in front of all these people and fought so kudos to him but uh yeah I don't think he's gonna like be a great boxer I mean probably him uh first of all came on the show so Gotta Give him credit for that came on came on our show now he's doing other shows these are all you know just the highlights of his life I'm sure it's just a correlation yeah they exactly I'm not saying one cause the other but like probably we did do our show before you know a lot of this stuff happened we we did do our show before he did every other show and so uh I thought it was great you know uh I think the transition from like Disney kid vine star YouTuber kind of [ __ ] uh you know brand to he's legitimately good he is legitimately good he is not I would not call him a celebrity boxer he's like an amateur boxer actually like he's like he's a very good amateur very good amateur boxer and he's an Entertainer and like he you know he's done an amazing job staying relevant but evolving the game with him I think that uh a lot of people hate on this guy or laugh at him or whatever else I think there's a lot of good lessons you can take about Reinventing yourself and finding a way to merge maybe things you're interested in or passionate about with your skills in the world of business or entertainment and uh he's done it phenomenally well and thinking from first principles like him and his brother Logan they didn't just ask what should I do next as a YouTuber they were like what can I do next using this audience in this Fame and they came up with different answers than 99.9 of other YouTubers out there you're getting credit for that yeah and he's tough I don't think he's gonna be a great boxer but he's super tough for doing that so that's awesome next from one controversial social media star to another Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan are being detained for a third 30-day sentence in Romania of course they're charged with human trafficking they claim that there is no evidence and they still haven't had a trial uh what you guys take Andrew take human trafficker or wrongly imprisoned oof I don't know much about it do you no I mean who knows what he did but uh first of all Romania guilty and until proven innocent what's going on here why is he why is he in these like he says because he's tweeting out he says he's like in solitary confinement basically um while he hasn't had a trial that's a that's a little strange he also said uh dude he said I've been in this thing for 30 days now they don't let me out just imagine locking yourself in your bedroom for 24 hours just go ahead and do that now think about where I'm going through I wanted to cry but then he said like but I realize I'm too tough for that uh but it sounds like you have Twitter access does everybody can somebody explain this to me because he tweeted out two hours ago my body is in jail but my mind is not in jail do you understand what I don't understand is how do you have Twitter right now yeah I don't know either what kind of LAX prison is this yeah and you said are you gonna be putting free Tate in your Twitter bio no I'm not going to be putting that I I don't care dude I will pay you 100 to put free Cobra tape in your Twitter bio that would be so funny for 24 hours just do it that'd be amazing oh no not a chance I I'm not team Andrew Tate I wouldn't say I'm not I don't like how he talks to people so I guess I would say I'm I'm kind of against them I have no idea about the story other than if he did do what he's accused of then yeah that sounds pretty fair but I have no idea what the truth is yeah he's kind of cringe to be honest with you but uh yeah let's go on all right let's move on to the lab leak Theory so multiple government sources are now saying that they think the lab leak theory for the origins of kova 19 is true this includes the department of energy and the FBI so fellas are you surprised I am not surprised I am not surprised this ever since that one Jon Stewart clip have you seen this this Jon Stewart clip Sam where he goes he was ringing the bell early on right yeah it was pretty early on this was like when it was still unpopular and in fact you would get like seven kids bigger your videos taken down or like a giant flag saying this person's a conspiracy theorist for saying it and he goes on the Colbert's show and he does this little bit where he goes um he says something about the lab leak and you know this leak from a lab and it's crazy and then Colbert goes we you know gladly I mean you're saying that we there we don't know that there's no evidence because evidence there's a coronavirus that originated in Wuhan where there is the wuhad coronavirus lab because it's in the name and he just keeps going off he's like he's like there's a chocolate leak in Hershey Pennsylvania is this you know is this random or maybe it's the Chocolate Factory you know like he brings us up and it was just like so obvious at that point uh and it's like what how unlikely would it be that in all places the novel he's like the novel coronavirus originates in Wuhan where there is the Wuhan novel coronavirus research lab like that you know you're telling me that that just happened to be the case like seems like the odds are that it came from that lab not that it just happened to be in that land in that same area I remember my friend Jack telling me about this like early on and my friend jack is not quite a he's not a conspiracy theorist at all but he is very open-minded and like he believes like he doesn't believe lots of things but he'll like when people say that they originally were thinking well that's crazy and his response was like okay well let's see what the evidence is and and maybe we'll explore it and I remember him telling me that I'm like Jack you're pretty crazy for thinking that and my big lesson over these last three years as it regards to this story is not like did it or did it not come out of that but now it's looking like maybe it did or at least for sure it did somewhere between maybe and for sure not for sure it didn't and my takeaway is there's things that I would use to dismiss as just crazy and only crazy people would believe this but I've seen over the last five or ten years as I've like become more of an adult and like paid attention to these things I've seen that like man crazy things do happen and also a lot of huge life-changing things are just accidents they just happen like and and now I have a little bit more of an open mind when people say like well this person is uh conspiring with this other person to make this happen or whatever and I'm like oh baby they're let's let's have an open mind and explore the facts if we can right yeah there's a I remember back when this first started it was basically considered racist to say that the virus might have leached from the lab in China and I never understood that I was like why would that be racist how is that racist I lived in China I don't find This Racist in any way like what are you talking about and um it reminds me of one time I tweeted out my favorite books I've tweeted out five of my favorite books or something like that and then the comment goes a bunch of people start commenting they go there's not one woman on this list these are my favorite books what are you talking about what are you talking about what I have to have 50 diversity in my favorite books and I I just replied I go all my favorite NBA players are black and I just sent people off that that totally triggered everybody because I was like no I am not apologizing because I named five of my favorite books and they just so happen to be written by men like that is not at all what I'm talking about and you're trying to like you know I call these people meter maids they just run around the internet looking for little tickets at the cars that they could ticket like where can I go be offended um you did you didn't you were not inclusive enough for me take it and I was like what are you talking about that's not even what this was about did you invent meter maid yeah yeah I did that last night I told you about content mode baby I'm writing and I'm I got some gems uh I'll give you the headline of something I'm writing right now I haven't even released any of this stuff yet um but but it's called congratulations you climbed Mount stupid I don't know the course from that headline to be like what's the what is the content here uh but I've just got a bunch of jams that I'm putting uh in my on my email list by the way go go subscribe to my email list I'll put in the show notes seanbury.com and go go put your thing in there I'm writing 365 original pieces in the next uh in the next year so one a day will go out and one of them is gonna be called congratulations you climbed Mount stupid what are you doing like a daily email yeah but it's a sequence that would never work it'll work I know I'm joking because we both had okay our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better all right Ben what do you got all right let's go rapid fire through a few of these uh I don't know if you saw this the Felix Dennis house so Felix Dennis very famous entrepreneur your boy I love him yeah uh publisher of Oz and author of how to be rich so he built this house for five million pounds uh it just sold for four million pounds it's really cool but one of the weirdest houses you'll ever see it's mostly a pool uh in the middle and it's a Treasure Island themed with like palm trees and like a bunch of pirate stuff and the whole house only has two bedrooms so the question is fellas does this make you guys into themed houses are you guys going to be building uh themed houses now well the takeaway here for me is f Legacy it's because this guy built something that he wanted and oftentimes people will say things like um well what about the resale value of this thing um or how how is this going to impact your legacy and my reply to that lately has been like well I don't know like I'm I'm gonna be dead I don't care and so what I appreciate about this is that he spent his money the way he wanted to and he made something cool even if it didn't do uh make any Financial sense so I think it's cool um and if you haven't read his book how to get rich we've talked about a bunch here it changed my life whenever we talk about that book it like goes up to like number uh 10 top 10 in the business category so go read it it's awesome there's a picture in this article of him with a extremely voluptuous person that says Felix Dennis spent a hundred million dollars on sex drugs and rock and roll in his lifetime yeah that's what he talks about so he basically says right Sam yeah was that your new company's mission statement core values close uh he uh basically from age like 35 to uh like 40. he was addicted to crack that was his drug was I swear to God crack cocaine he loved it and he died uh single he had a partner but they had an open relationship so the guy's been doing a lot of psychedelics and open relationships before it was cool um no he was a very weird and quirky guy and he like basically says he spent north of 100 million dollars in his book he goes I spent 100 100 million on on hookers and crack so uh you know whatever dude yeah I don't believe that everyone's talking Wilt Chamberlain said he slept with 10 000 women in his lifetime and if you do the math do the math on that is like horrible it's like it's crazy it's like dude you gotta sleep with two women a day for you know many years yeah I think it's even more than that yeah because he wasn't that old at that time um by the way you said something about themed houses I'm in on themed houses I think themed houses are great and more than more than the theme actually is epic common area he said two bedrooms that I think bedrooms are a giant waste I think you only need a couple bedrooms and you should have epic common areas if you're gonna have a mansion I don't like the eight bedroom mansion you know like I got opinions on mansions and that's one of them you gotta have epic common spaces and only a couple bedrooms three four bedrooms Max I don't want to see a fifth bedroom and you know what his um charity was that he left all this money to was creating forests so he's like the Johnny Appleseed of England the guy he like has like thousands of Acres of forests that he owns and I think this house it's known for having all types of trees so in Colombia he's like the crack cocaine Foundation donating my wealth all right all right I love this one the Minnesota Department of Transportation ran a snowplow naming contest so they got a new snow plow they needed a name and they out they crowdsource it to the public here's some of the top vote Getters you're a blizzard Harry blizzo clearopathra better call salt and Han Solo so guys do you have a favorite from this list their last one I think I like clear clearopatha I think that one's pretty good I did not see that one coming remember when they did a Bodie mcboat face when like uh I think it was like uh I think it was like either a fairy or a tugboat or something like that like a town let people vote on it and Reddit got a hold of it and they made the number one voted thing boaty mcboatface uh and so I love these viral stunts I think they're awesome well Sam I don't want to steal your thunder but you did want to announce your tattoo naming contest Sam is willing to get a tattoo on his back that any anybody that is gonna be a contest from the fans of my first million isn't that right Sam that is we're totally wrong I was I think I did when I did say there's this you remember how we talked about mini Katana yeah they're sending me a gold sword I guess Katana I don't know the difference that has MFM on it so I've I'm collecting all types of MFM stuff I don't know Katana a sword by the way is it what reader made the meter maids are running around they're excited about that one uh well I have a gold Katana on my way that has my first million on it so I'll I'll accept all MFM stuff but I'm not gonna tattoo with these okay how about a million YouTube subscribers will you get a crowdsourced tattoo I will get a tattoo at a million for sure uh when I I went and did this podcast uh in LA with like this guy Cody KO so he's really good he's kind of like a a comedy YouTuber guy and um his Studio looked awesome he was telling us about they have this uh they have like a network and they have some other show called trillionaire energy or something like that um and so he they put it up on the screen there's like a screen you can see while we're sitting there and it was The Two Hosts in slow motion with music just getting closer together and these two guys just made out and I'll go whoa what's the show about and he goes no they had said if they get to whatever a hundred thousand Subs that they would kiss did they really do that and I go oh yeah that's a good idea that's how like you comedy YouTuber Hollywood people think yeah that's a good idea We're not gonna do that but but that's a great do they really do it like they did it it's a hilarious video it's in slow-mo as they get closer and closer and they just make out are they tongued it's intense I'd rather be I'd rather be unsuccessful yeah exactly [Music] how bad you want it I don't want it that bad this incredible success you gotta find the price of success and then pay it it's too expensive for me yeah it's out of my budget yeah I'm out we have we have food at home you wanna do one more yeah that's the last one all right last one so uh blue sky is a new Twitter clone uh backed by Jack Dorsey and unlike Twitter it is decentralized and so the question is fellas are you supporting our comrades over at Blue Sky or are you supporting the capitalist pigs over at Twitter what's your move dude Jack Dorsey owns a bank how are you gonna call him a comrade right I mean he's moving away from Capital he's seen the air of his way soon dude when I hear okay so here's some of the words they use open source social protocol uh and decentralized when I hear those words I just I just don't care I just don't care at all like they want me to care about it and that's wonderful and maybe sometimes I'll act like I do uh but I don't I don't care at all uh like if you tell me uh probiotic antioxidant right yeah I don't care if you want to shove it in there and I'll I'll drink it if it tastes good right but I don't but I don't even know I'll drink it if it tastes it that's my take on this as well I'll use this this app if it's awesome if the content is great the people on it are interesting and if it's something different than Twitter if it's Twitter but the database is different I'm out I don't care about that that's not that's not what draws people in I don't that doesn't mean it's not a good idea great do it do it differently under the hood but it has to result in something different that the person actually gets to use yeah and the same thing happened with web3 where they like they give me this horrible pitch and then they end it with web3 and I'm like well I don't care if it's web3 just does this thing work is it awesome and I feel the same way about this so I don't care and also Matt have you tried Mastodon yeah dude it's stupid too it's stupid no like it's it's dumb so anyway I'm not on board with this all right all right [Music] foreign [Music]

all right let's do this what uh what topics you got today I've got a billion of the week [Music] [Applause] [Music] a billion dollars all right so I'm gonna tell you some facts about this Billy of the week and I want you to see if you can guess who this person is all right okay I'm game so Steve Jobs so one time Steve Jobs approached him uh on advice about designing the Apple Stores and when they discuss each of their products Steve said to this guy I'm not sure if the iPhone is going to be very popular in 20 years but I'm certain that your products are definitely going to be popular so that's one interesting thing about them intriguing okay he's had multiple tennis matches with with Roger Federer he lives in a 150 year old castle and last year his company did 84 billion in revenue and 22 billion in operating profits and this is my give it away this year his company was the fourth largest company in the world and oftentimes he's number one on the richest person in the world the Louis Vuitton guy the Louis Vuitton guy [Music] foreign [Music] I don't know how to say his name because it's French we're gonna call him Bernie but uh it's uh it's Bernard Arnold I don't know if the t's silent sorry but it's it's usually not a hard tea but we're gonna go with that yeah is that a hard tea is that a soft tea I don't know Bernie Arnie you are the man so Steve Jobs really went to this guy huh dude yeah and a lot of people really respect this guy so I'll like give you a little bit about his background but some facts about him so he owns 46 so the Louis Vuitton Empire it's called lvmh so it's a multinational luxury goods conglomerate deal market cap of 430 billion oftentimes him Elon and like Bezos go back and forth uh but he's kind of the odd man out because he's not like he like dresses really nice and he like looks as like a someone who owns Louis Vuitton would look he like has this black turtleneck and a nice sports jacket but he's been called the um uh well I believe it's like the the uh the wolf and cashmere sweaters or something like that because he's like he's pretty ruthless but he like dresses nice but uh uh yeah I'll tell you a little bit about them so at 21 it's kind of an interesting fact I call you the denim Fox right the denim box yeah yeah I wish the Juggernaut the dog and the Canadian tux that's what I'm known for uh the denim dog uh so listen at 21 Bernie joined his father's Construction Company after finishing his engineering degree and by 25 he was the CEO of the company the company wasn't small at all uh at the time it was doing uh something like 10 million in Revenue which is the equivalent to 40 million now and had a thousand employees but right when he joined he like he said let's expand so we got into like some he started investing investing the profits and some Finance businesses into real estate things like that then in 1981 he goes to the U.S and he starts expanding the business and eventually he like specializes and specializes in town homes sells a bunch of them makes the equivalent of 75 million dollars now uh which was 25 million back then or that's what he sold his company for I don't know what he made from it but there's an interesting thing that happens so he's in the cab he's in a taxi in New York and he asked the taxi driver if he heard of the president of France and the taxi driver was like nope never but I know all about Christian Dior who uh you know Dior is like a like a luxury a luxury brand and he started thinking he's like Okay so this guy who's like just a normal guy in New York doesn't know who the president of France is but he knows all about Christian Dior like maybe I should explore uh like luxury Brands and so he he buys the holding company eventually of Dior and it was like all like he got inspired by that first taxicab meeting he raises a bunch of money buys it fires a ton of people turns it around sells like the other brands Dr owns and it's a really good success and that's like his first big entry into luxury Brands then in 1987 he gets the idea uh uh to buy Louis Vuitton and he does the same thing where he raises a bunch of money and he buys it and he fires a bunch of people and definitely turns on a big deal was it doing was it very successful at the time or was it like distressed it was Christian Dior was like distressed when he bought it they both were distressed but they were both Brands and so that kind of brings us to like the big Point here which is do you I mean Louis Vuitton has been around for hundreds of years um or at least 100 years um I think from since the 1800s but they they were kind of mismanaged so have you seen that movie with I think it's Lady Gaga Lady Gaga where she like is that how they say it Lady Gaga have you seen that movie where she plays like the wife of like the Gucci guy and like murders him I saw part of it yeah yeah you saw the trailer to be honest with you yeah it was only these but uh you know big guy fan so uh they uh it's like mismanaged so like a lot of these family businesses they like have great Style by it's kind of like you know like a a singer managing their own career like maybe like you know the left part of the brain doesn't actually work well with business but it works and stuff and so it was the same thing where it was definitely mismanaged he raises all this money and he just turns him into an operation Powerhouse and then he just starts going on a on a spree where he starts buying all this stuff so he owns all these Brands he owns uh you know I don't freaking buy any of this [ __ ] so I'm gonna look like an idiot talking about it but Sephora which is like the big makeup thing um fenny which is another popular thing Bulgari Marc Jacobs like if everything that a woman aspires to own he owns like a huge portion of of that market but I want to tell you about a few of the things um that interest or that make me interested in this guy and first have you have you heard about him do you know anything about him uh I had only seen him because he's at the top of the rich list and he's you know lvmh but I didn't know I didn't know this backstory so go on so what interests me about him is I think Peter Thiel has this book what's that book called that zero to one zero to one and it's awesome um I I really like reading that book and it kind of had an impact on me where he talked about like extreme personalities and having extreme results and all about like an engineering culture yada yada yada but there's one part of the book where he lists out all the moats he's like you can have like you can like know like a secret that no one else knows you could have like a patent you could have technology that no one else has whatever but and then he mentions there's this one moat called bran that's a huge moat and I think he's like I never understood brand so I don't know there's one sense and he says this is definitely a boat not for me I don't get it I don't understand it and I always thought that was funny because when a lot of like tech people discuss moats they talk about like technology Network's effects rarely do they discuss brand well this guy Bernie that's truly what he understood where he was like no they're like that's where all my margin is is because I can create a brand I'm going to create luxury goods I'm going to get luxury margins and not only that it's gonna live for forever so uh Louis Vuitton by the way was founded in 1854. and he his whole thing was like uh in 10 years there will be far fewer luxury Brands and the ones that survive will be more important because people are getting richer and richer and richer and if a brand has been around for 50 years he thinks it can be around for another 50 or 150 years so that's like a soul shtick and uh I thought that was interesting and he um has this rare combo of operational excellence and also like good style and understanding brand because typically this might be an overreaching statement but a lot of times these really rich people are like maybe like uh what's his name um uh Warren Buffett might be a little bit like that where he like sees like what a good business is and he's like well I don't care this could probably last for a long time let's just do it I can look at the spreadsheets and I can understand it and then other times there's people who are like this is a sick brand and they just totally but they totally mismanage it and they're not numbers oriented but then you got a guy like this guy who like does a pretty good job of like being pretty ruthless that you like you need to be in order to make the business hugely profitable and very successful but also like understands like vision and some of these intangible things basically like how to make [ __ ] cool which is very very very challenging it's hard to have just that let alone both of those features so I thought that guy was interesting um and he has a few interesting quotes and I'll wrap up so luxury goods are the only area which is possible to make luxury margins for me luxury is how do you create desire and then he says I'm optimistic long-term pessimistic short term so interesting interesting guy he is here's another one I think that's like um something about being rich without uh being famous he has some some quote like that and he's not quite a recluse but he like owns this island in the Bahamas where he spends most of his time obviously flies private and is somewhat under the radar compared to Bezos who's in the news with his you know new girlfriend and things like that this guy's pretty low-key and his business he owns like all the voting shares and all that and he when he dies he always says he's giving 20 to each of his five children and it's run like a family business so in that regard he's pretty low-key and out of out of the out of media uh mostly right uh yeah okay I can't really fully find it but uh he had said some there's some French phrase which is like the only uh something about uh something about being you know being happy uh you know basically it was it was something around the idea of you want to be wealthy but not rich and he had some cool French way of saying it but I can't find it off top of my head here be a lot cooler if you did but that's all right sure would well that's my that's my Billy of the week dude I have another like weird internet culture thing that I was uh kind of related to like your engineers I was thinking about this and I think that what I'm about to say is incredibly not normal but I think for you it's normal and it's incredibly normal for me and it's probably normal for a bunch of our friends so I was thinking about this we got we I have this new researcher that you're trying to steal from me a little bit um and it's I met him through a friend of a friend but it all started on Twitter and the Twitter DMS and without talking to this person like uh uh whether a phone or or Zoom or whatever meeting in person we just like text and we hire them and we do a business exchange and like you put a lot of trust in one another and I've realized I've done this like 20 times where someone like my best co-workers and best uh some of my best friends in fact it just started like through internet culture and we very rarely exchange words and we've done like some relatively big business together where we're like exchanging tens of thousands of dollars a month or we've invested one in other companies or whatever so I've done it with a partner on my latest company uh Joe we basically were Facebook friends yeah maybe only like six times um but like we knew each other for like five years before we really uh like talked a lot in person I've done it with this guy Diego who I'm helping him with his agency business I heard a funny story from about you on this so uh somebody who's work with you goes yeah Sam gave me the login to his Instagram or something like that or to LinkedIn I don't know what it was and what is it that you requested back from this internet stranger Sam I asked for his social security number I asked for his girlfriend's social security number I asked for uh a picture ID of both him and his girlfriend and a utility bill so I knew exactly where he lived the sapphire School of background checks like dude what is your plan okay let's say what is he gonna do all right let's say you post something or changes the password what are you gonna do with this utility bill and his social security number what is your what is your your revenge well I don't know but I know it's scary enough that if someone has that I don't know sign them up for a credit card I would I would show up to his house for sure yeah I don't know but uh I don't know maybe it's like scary enough that it worked but have you done this have you like done business with a bunch of it's not Anonymous people because you actually get to know them but Internet it's like a weird internet totally that's like very normal now at this point which is strange it shouldn't it almost feels like it shouldn't be normal but it is I don't think it's normal for most people I mean it just seems natural you see I feel like I know these people I see their writing or I hear their podcasts or they they email me a bunch of times and we go back and forth and then they're in my slack and then sure enough it's like hey you know here's everything yeah here's the keys to the castle and once you get that once you're working together or you're doing things together that builds even more trust and it just layers on and then you beat them four years later and you're like you see them in person and they're like nice to meet you uh you know you don't know what to say it's like nice to see your nice to see your body nice to see your face finally yeah like sick legs dude I'm I'm okay not meeting these people I I like it how it is if it ain't broke don't fix it like I enjoy these types of relationships yeah we have this feature not a bug right for sure and we have this one Dev I have this Dev working on a project uh that I have and he's in Hong Kong and he's in high school and he built this amazing thing and I don't really know anything about him other than I want to work with you for a very long time and like I was just he sent me some of his work and it was so awesome and I just realized this is super odd and also amazing and I don't think a lot of people realize that you could like do business like this because I'll tell my family and they'll think I'm crazy but it's become so normal at this point that I don't even I forget that it's not normal amongst others right right yeah totally I've also a lot of my real life friends I just sort of like shifted more to online I'm like hey let's we can hang out 10 times more through the group chat and through a bunch of a bunch of these little like like you know apps or things like that I feel like I get to know them better that way almost and you know anybody got time to hang on in person anymore and now we know why the birth rate in America is declining rapidly but yeah this basically like is uh a thing that I do and I thought I should bring that up because I don't think most people realize like how some of that stuff happens and it's actually quite random how it happens but if I see like a 19 year old who's like impressive or like a 21 who's impressive and like writes well and is like clever in my DMs some this sounds like creepy but I'm like I'm I'm I'm interested in giving them a shot on something and so it's really cool how these like little projects actually turn into like pretty meaningful things after a while right yeah they're iyb's interesting young boys [Laughter] yeah pretty little things rip no disrespect all right I want to tell you about somebody interesting I met recently too so did we talk about Chris uh Sparling on the podcast yet yeah so uh we have this great friend named Andrew Wilkinson who has maybe close to a billion dollar Empire and Chris is his partner in crime and I had never met him until we went to that event in Vancouver for the show and you guys are really similar you guys are very similar me and him you have similar some some similar uh parts of you yeah yeah for sure um a couple of a couple of observations I would say about him um I want you to tell him if you because you've interacted with him right you've met him only a couple times but yeah and we're both very interested in these kind of like high performers especially in this case it's a high performer who went and built their own Island and did they won in their signature way I think that that's particularly what's interesting to us like if somebody's just like I don't know some VP at Google I'm a lot less interested than somebody like Chris who basically made their own path I think he you know Andrew met him when he was working at a bank he was like a banker uh not like a cool investment banker but like a go to the bank I need to write a check banker and they started talking about cars because Andrea drove up in a cool car and uh they both nerd out about cars and then they were like okay what's going on you know what do you need for you're getting like a line of credit or whatever for your business what's your business uh Chris was like yeah I'm like studying to be like a CPA or like I'm about to get my my license to be an accountant or something like that and um Andrew was like hey you want to just leave here with me and like you know work with me you know Chris it actually happened at the bank he didn't say it like that but he you know he offered him a job he said you should come work with me uh like I need help at the time Andrew just had meta lab his design agency was doing well and um had gotten to maybe a couple million dollars a year of profit um you know let's call it I don't know four or five years in something like that uh but so so he hadn't started what became tiny which was acquiring a bunch of other internet companies and so Chris tells the story here's some of the things that I took away from this uh this this meeting so one interesting part of the story he goes so my first day at work I show up uh Andrew's not there I'm just like waiting at the door and um 30 minutes go by Andrew's not there Andrew rolls up in an Uber with like you know one airpod hanging out of zero whatever and he's got he opens up the trunk he takes up this giant box full of papers and he's like he's like you're here okay fantastic here's uh all of our papers for like you know here's the business finances um I gotta go to a meeting and there's no office space for you so I talked to my neighbor they have room in their basement so just go knock on the door tell them you're with Andrew and like there's a desk in their basement and like here's this box of papers then he's like and I left and the Chris was like man I made a huge mistake uh who is this guy what is happening here he goes he knocks on the door he's like hey um do you have like a basement desk for me yeah yeah come on in and it's like when you see the guy with the hole in his boot you know you're there make it right all his food exactly he's like so that's how it started and then I go okay so then that time is just doing metal lab so what how did this become tiny and he goes uh well we looked at the business and the business was good business was generating Revenue was generating profit it's like okay well like what do we do with this profit um what are we supposed to you know should we reinvest this in some way into the business like could we grow can we should we hire people he goes I don't know what do all agencies do he goes agencies hire a bunch of people uh and then buy fancy offices and they put a basketball hoop in the office like you know they put a play pit in the office and he's like yeah that doesn't seem like a good idea we should not do that that's kind of the only thing they agreed on let's not do that they go well okay we can't follow agencies to figure out what we should do like you know how should we think about this and they go well look we're a business that has clients and we have you know like uh service team and then we have some profits like we are a boring Law Firm Let's Just Pretend We're a boring law firm uh let's not try to be a cool agency let's be a boring law firm and not get too high on our own Supply okay so what what could we do with these profits if we weren't going to like try to just get flashier and flashier with the design agency um and that's where they decided let's buy a Better Business than our current business so like let's buy a business that has recurring revenues maybe that has less service oriented more of a product and let's use the profits from the service business to buy increasingly better businesses so I thought I liked that story that frame I enjoyed that and what was the first thing that they bought was it dribble no that wasn't the first thing I don't know I don't know exactly what the first thing the bot is but honestly it was probably another agency is my guess but you know regardless now that's kind of the start of their Journey so I never met Chris Andrew uh talks a little bit about him but you know you never really know uh what people are like here's my observations Chris had the juice and it was very surprising to me that Chris had the juice because normally in these Partnerships there's like the outgoing uh face of the brand that everybody knows and then there's like the quiet silent but deadly operational partner Finance partner or whoever partner that's like doesn't really care about the spotlight um and usually is more reserved I would say most of that is true but at this dinner I thought it was remarkable that he was kind of like this like it was shy but he still had the juice and I've never really seen that combo before like I think he would have rather just been at home reading a book but he had this thing which is like I'm at this dinner so the flip is the switch is flipped and he was like super talkative and not not because he's Mr Charisma or he's not like dripping with like you know he's like this charm he has wisdom it feels like he was he was just like I would call it honest he was just like he would ask a question and if you said something he'd be like hold on hold on so is it like this or he'd be like but you're saying this is that because you think that or is that because your parents taught you that why did you say that and he would say that pointed that's what reminds that's one of the ways in which you guys are similar is you ask those same questions I do and I so I was eating it up I was loving it I was like oh this guy's right up my alley the other thing he did those like me but times ten is he was like Mr framework exactly you guys are the exact same way for that reason I called him out in the dinner I was like bro you have just named 14 different like cognitive biases and one dinner it's crazy like he'd be like it's like the strike sand effect mixed with with the thing that you know the the the the like you know the sucker's bias and it's like what are you talking about you yeah just like an index he had an index of mental models I was like this I was like did you download Twitter threads and you just memorized them like how do you know all this and why are they so top of mind for you and that's really how he thinks he he truly seems to think that way which I thought was really interesting well you know why so Andrew told me this I don't know like the what Chris's story is but Andrew said they basically were like building their own companies and like reinvesting the profits into building their own things and then they read the biography of Warren Buffett I think it's called snowball or something and then they read like a Charlie Munger book and they go oh yeah let's do this instead and so they start buying companies that work and they have the you know like I think Tiny's website says we buy wonderful companies that's basically I think exactly what Buffett said uh tiny is just we buy wonderful internet companies and then yeah but Berkshire just doesn't have internet in it right and so they basically stole uh you know a lot of Buffett's really great ideas and also have you ever read a Charlie Munger book or anything by Charlie Munger yeah yeah for sure dude their Frameworks about everything there's like ones called like poor Charlie's Almanac I think it's called and it's like 88 different Frameworks I started reading it and I'm like dude I need a story here but yeah it was a very strange book people say they love that book and I'm convinced that anybody who says they love that book hasn't actually opened it because when you open it it's not even like a book it's like a uh have you seen have you have you actually opened the book yeah I read the whole thing and I found it very hard to even remember it's hard to read dude it's like it's like a list of rules yeah yeah it's like the table of contents except it's long it's a very challenging book to read but I what I remember from the book and then hanging out with Chris is like oh you read a lot of Monger because you guys are sort of similar in that framework and another thing Buffett does is like he'll say things I forget exactly what he phrases but he's like uh you know why kill a mice why kill a mouse well we can go and shoot an elephant like he'll say things like this or he'll like create some analogy you're picking up pennies in front of a steamroller or yeah we're talking about something he goes so is that like diamically sword that slays the Beast and I was like I was like what the [ __ ] are you talking about like I was like uh I don't know what that is what are you saying in English and he's like no like you know the story of Daya whoever there's some Greek guy and I was like no I don't know any of these things what are you talking about yeah it's like dude I need an analogy for your analogy but I've noticed that Chris uh the Liberty the time that I've been around him he does the same thing where I can tell who he's read and he's really good at what he does and I think he's also naturally like that he just like thinks in Frameworks and analogies and things like that he can take complicated things and make him quite simple totally and he uh I think he's really really like super curious which I really respected about him like I felt like when he was asking questions he wasn't doing it to make conversation he was doing it because he actually really wanted to know the answer he was genuinely interested and I think that comes up comes off and I think that is a huge um like Saving Grace for I think people overthink how to be in social situations and like you know the easiest hack is just simply genuinely be interested in the other person everything else will work itself out um that's how I felt about Chris and I really like that we had a interesting different conversation I'll share one uh one little tidbit that that can take a dinner conversation from surface level to a lot more interesting and um I forgot who was talking it was the CEO of something and um she said something and I go I go let me ask you a question a little bit a little bit of a weird question can I ask you and she's like yeah and I go um growing up I said what you said was really interesting just now and it made me wonder why you why you wanted that so bad growing up whose love did you want more your mom or your dad's oh my God and uh you know she immediately like started to take it take it back by the question but then kind of answers and then and people open up about their like they open up about their relationship with their parents and also like it's kind of like where'd that chip on your shoulder come from is really what this question is asking and I stole this from Tony Robbins Tony robbers asked this question and I saw that like in most of who he does he's like uh live kind of coaching sessions or whatever with people during his events and he had asked this question and it immediately found like the actual answer to the to the problem and since then I've like kept this question in my back pocket and I asked it from time to time it's a very revealing question um hard to say without sounding like just like a pretentious prick um yeah did you have like your like glasses like in your mouth like yeah yeah exactly the tip of the frame needs to go into the mouth and you have to be wearing a turtleneck but if you do happen to have a turtleneck on it is such a good turtleneck question that's ridiculous and it worked oh it worked and then the whole the whole table kind of shared their answers to it and it went from like all right we can either sit here and we'll go one inch deep or like we ended up 50 feet deep and I felt like everybody actually felt like they knew each other and um and it was like after the fact it was like so what do you do again it's like you know you're trying to it kind of reversed the order of how most of these like kind of networking dinners go and I've been to a lot of these and so like I appreciate something that can break out of that that surface level you know surface level stuff fluff that's not really that interesting dude I was at this one dinner recently and this guy who was a younger guy and he was like a fan of our stuff so he was and he like clearly like was learning how to interact with people like he was like an internet guy who like read How to Win Friends and Influence People and the first thing that he said to me and my wife was like he was trying to do what you did and he asked us like when did you guys first have sex and what was it like I swear to God and I like I I was so frustrated and I was like I'll answer your question but you got to answer mines first how much money's in your checking account how long is your dick and what was it like when you saw your parents having sex for the first time and he was like what I go yeah that's weird right I don't want to talk about that don't be weird and he clearly had like read like a book on how to do this and then he like saw something you said and I thought that would have been a good idea and it wasn't it was a total mess well there's something that you got to do right you can't just ask out of the blue oh he did the only reason this question worked on ours was because when somebody's explaining the chip like they have this chip on the shoulder you're basically it's a natural question to ask where did it come from and then they give you some [ __ ] answer you say all right let me ask you a different question and you dig in that way you can't just go up to somebody be like hello I'm Sean nice to meet you hey I was curious what's your deepest darkest secret right like it doesn't really work like that yeah it was weird man it was weird it was one of these guys I'm uh it was horrible uh but you pulled it off this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better all right what else you got um okay oh I'll give you one other uh Chris little gem that that came out of the talk uh somebody was telling a story about somebody else and and it was kind of a story that was like uh what do they call it like a romp it's basically like it's a rock like a like it's like a it's like a tale about like you're you know you could tell a tale of like your drunken days and this the the crazy thing that happened that we almost got arrested then we ended up it's like it's a story that doesn't have a lot of like it's not like a meaningful story it's an entertaining story and um and so the person's telling the story about like this business romp so somebody was like gonna get rich and then they like it went almost broke and then now they're okay and like you know whatever happened and he goes and then the takeaway was you know that you know that person they said yeah they could have they could have sold the top and made a bunch of money but they said you know well if I had done that then I wouldn't have blah blah blah blah and he said something that has stuck with me which he goes do you think that's the right lesson to learn out of that and he got he goes I wonder that sometimes he goes people always talk about like how the lessons Chris and he goes um he was a question I often asked is like is that is this person somebody who's learning the right lesson out of things and I thought it was so funny uh it was like a blunt thing to say and so I loved it already the second thing was it's so true I look around the people around me in life that I encounter and very rarely like if like a lot of people have experienced go through experiences and think they learn a lesson but if I was to measure like the hit rate of are they actually having the correct takeaway out of a situation it's shockingly low and I think that that is one of the greatest indicators of success is are you actually able to learn the correct lesson from your life experiences um nobody's 100 on that because we all have weird things where we'll blame other people or we'll glorify ourselves and not realize that we just got lucky we'll do weird things like that but um I realize oh I want to only be around and work with people and hire people who are high on this score I don't really care how much experience you have but if you don't take away the right lesson from the experiences you're going that you have and that you're going to have your rate of learning is just gonna like it it'll be a different rate or you'll just end up in some weird trajectory where you'll just do dumb [ __ ] because you're taking away the wrong lessons from your life experiences and I've I just never heard somebody say that out loud and it really stood out to me and it's like now I see it everywhere that's a that's a really good question I wonder if that is something that he came up with or like was inspired by I mean it's a hard thing that's a really unique that's a really unique I said it kind of as an offhand comment this one wasn't one of his like Frameworks or like go-to's I could tell it was just like he literally just asked the question because he was because it was so he hurt like it was kind of like uh you know when somebody starts a sentence and you kind of your brain is trying to fill in the blank of the last thing they're gonna say and then they say something's totally different you're like that is not where I thought you were going with that that's what happened in the story it's like 90 of It kind of made sense and then the last 10 at the conclusion was like some other weird conclusion and he was like what is that the way that was the conclusion I feel like the collusion should have been X but you're saying their takeaway was why what uh and and so I don't even think he really meant it that way or he really put that much weight into it but that was my my Golden Nugget of that dinner was that one question and uh and I can't I literally can't stop seeing it everywhere now like my kid does something my wife does something I do something and I I started to think back I was like in what areas did I take away the wrong lesson like I don't know if you think back in your life can you think of an example where if you're honest with yourself it's like yeah actually I kind of learned the wrong I kind of did I even learn the right lesson from that was that the right answer there's a few things like you know how that phrase like fail fast like I used to believe that that was cool and then I'm like I'd rather succeed fast like so yeah like I'd rather not fail at like how could I succeed faster than I fail and I remember thinking it like for years I was thinking well it's okay I tried something and I'm like but like if I'm a baseball player and I take lots of swings but I don't get any hits like that's bad that's not good that's very bad so the lesson here is I should swing and also have a high batting average and I remember thinking like oh just shots on goal that's all that's all that matters but I'm like no I need a score too and so for years like I thought it was okay to fail because I'm failing fast I'm moving fast I'm breaking things whatever and then I'm like maybe I shouldn't break things and I should actually like succeed fast and I remember like that like it changed like five years ago yeah yeah totally uh yeah I can think of a bunch of examples in my life where I've I think messed that up but now that's not the case did you learn the right lesson when you got roasted by some people for posting your private Chef dude you posted this picture of this nice looking food and people are like dude your blood glucose is gonna Spike and you're gonna be so unproductive because you're eating rice uh I thought that was pretty funny all the oh yeah also that wasn't rice whatever it was people were like giving you a hard time I thought it was pretty funny you only caught three a few of them there's three four reactions reaction one so what did I do I posted a tweet that was just like a delicious meal I was so happy I was having this meal I said best life decision was hiring hiring a family chef and um there was four reactions there was the uh predictable positive which was oh yum looks good predictable negative which was uh hey douchebag people are struggling in the world you're posting this like a nice Flex you know [ __ ] uh so there's predictable negative there was the predictable um next question which was how much does this actually cost um you know like what goes into this which is a fine question no problem and then uh and then there was just like you know whatever the sort of like the the random or like the the interesting I think the person who had the right answer from it which was you either should just move on if it's not interesting to you or if it is interesting to you you should be like yeah that's something I want in my life let me put bring that back to the front of my brain um as something that like you know I kind of want and um I thought that I thought it was very funny I didn't even know I wanted that until I met somebody who had a private chef and I was like wow this is incredible so you're telling me like instead of them having to cook three meals a day and they're you know also they have a wife and kids like you know instead of their whole family have to cook three meals a day do grocery shopping do the dishes to end up with a meal that doesn't taste as good isn't as healthy um and takes up you know probably on average three to five hours you know per day if you average it all out including the the groceries and the cleaning and the cooking and the all of it um and you know but by the way three hours a day out of your like you know people have only have like 16 waking hours right like this is a it's a really significant chunk of time per day I was like well I saw it I was like oh that's a goal that I didn't even know I should have but I want that and I want that way more than I want uh uh you know a ski home in Tahoe or like a fancy car or those types of things and then I for I didn't do anything about it for a while because I assumed oh you got to be like a billionaire to have that no you can get them for as cheap as maybe a thousand a month maybe and then I was like oh let me do the math like how much do you actually need to do this and then I did the math I was like oh I think I could do this now and then I just did it and my life got way better and so I posted it because hey just whatever it's Twitter I didn't really think too much about it but like um you know there is a benefit in seeing somebody's uh like somebody do a decision in Life or have something in life that is attractive to you and brings it you know to your attention and makes you think about do I want this do I not uh can I have this can I not you know I think there's some value in that too so anyways that's that's my story on the tweet I thought it was pretty funny um I thought it was hilarious I am I was frustrated you didn't like holler at some of these people I almost started replying to them for you yeah I haven't decided if I'm a heel or a face yet so to use wrestling terms like um I'm tempted to just be a heel uh you know like it's way easier in the today's world I would say like uh what's his name the the dude who loves Keith for boy yeah I call them out I I don't like that guy well you don't like him because he's a heel right uh you know he basically um doesn't mind pissing people off telling people telling people off whatever it is and like that's his brand and he and some people are like man I love it this guy just tells it like it is or he's funny or you know he must be you know he he basically has his Aura of I'm better than you like like many great wrestling villains and um and he'll tell you how much you suck and so people some people hate that a lot of the majority of people hate that and then there's a minority people that love that and find him like interesting and either way you can't ignore him he's like you have to take a position because it's so um polarizing it's not just like you know vanilla and I would say you actually do a lot of what he does where uh I don't think you think you're doing it uh because you're like I didn't say anything bad it's like bro you put a period at the end of that line that just you're saying like a finger you know that's not a period um do you know you're doing it when you're doing it or not all the time maybe some of the time but I think I don't like um like I'm kind of a stickler with language like I like using certain words so if someone like says something and they end it in a question mark my reply will be like I don't know if you're asking a question or if you're getting me to agree with you you're stupid or yeah what I mean like I just it like I just like or when people like sensationalize things like we'll just say like well this happens all the time like for example someone replied to you and they go I've been seeing a lot of this lately my exam what I want to reply with is like oh okay well what are some other examples what are you talking about I'm a stickler with language I don't like when people say this always happens or this never happens or these people are everywhere like things like that I don't like that phraser this is so common uh that it's becoming an issue I'm like well I I actually don't think that it's any more common than it has ever been uh anyway so I'm an [ __ ] about that um you wanna do one more topic yeah uh let's do uh do you have one no I blew my load early oh wow uh and the internet thing but I think it is that I generate so many more ideas to do let's go let's did your mommy not do you or your daddy not love you if we look at the three years that we've done this I think it Ebbs and flows I think that each person goes on a chance dude dude each person goes on a three-month like reader dude 100 I think you talk more but I don't think that I don't think that you necessarily bring more topics right right uh I think that but I'll let you believe that thanks for your permission when I was selling the hustle you carried me when you were selling milk Road my shoulders got tired that's all I'm gonna say yeah that's all I'm going to say so I think it Ebbs and flows there was a there's a guy who basically took every idea from the podcast and put it in a database this is how I know I win because he took every idea from the podcast and took put in a database and he said it was 75 be 25 you but that's specifically on ideas not topics that's maybe ideas yeah yes like this Bernie guy that's not an idea right come on that's that that's that's you're definitely you're definitely the king of the building of the week I think uh you somehow know a bunch of these old ass [ __ ] in different spaces and uh and you you find these guys I don't know how you find these guys or how you think of just Wikipedia bro yeah but like why do they even get on your radar you'll be like this guy used to own this coal mine and then he bought the Shoe Factory and then he owns like you know you ever read the St Louis Post and I'm like nah you know he owns that so I'm like I don't know how you found but you know more power to you I just [ __ ] books can I give you okay let me give you a couple uh let me do an idea I'm gonna go rapid fire I'm gonna just empty the chamber here on some some things that have been on my list um I have a d2c idea that I'd like to do pass uh but I'd like to do I means I'm not gonna do it but I want to invest and advise somebody who does it who's really good wait do you still ever want to launch an Ecom store uh I don't know I'm torn I don't want to operate it myself but I do want to like incubate them I do want to like incubate them and hire a CEO that would run them in theory but uh that might also be difficult um so I have a a gut health one so gut health is uh this is nothing new so let me just start this by saying oh bro this that exists yeah I know it exists um almost every DDC idea you've had exists um gut health is a uh a trend that is going up up and up and it fits a sales model that really works with d2c what do I mean by that you mean you could just buy it over and over again you never know if it actually works so what works in d2c uh a d2c pro a great d2c product is one that is going to be high margin so maybe uh can you get to 75 80 gross margins well with supplements you can get to 80 85 percent gross margin so that's fantastic on the product itself the next thing that works in d2c is that it's a repeat purchase or it's a consumable so something that somebody's going to buy many times they'll shop from you again and again because either they ran out they ate it they drank it or the you know the deodorant stick ran out whatever it is unlike a mattress unlike a mattress um so so you want something that people grow out of or run out of and um so so high purchase rate well supplements have that as well health and wellness has that um as well you want something that is a uh is a problem solution fit so basically you want something that is not just like a kind of nice to have fashion item what works better uh in what sells better is something that you can just say do you have this problem we have this solution and this is why you see if you go scroll down to the bottom of a New York Post article you're going to see a toe fungus ad why is a toe fungus ad always there because guess what people have toe fungus it's a very easy problem to point out and people are looking for a solution and willing to buy something that tells that that promises them that it's going to go away so uh you probably do remember um the problem the best promise solution ever is uh Claude Hopkins he invented the advertising for toothpaste in the 1920s and he said rub your tongue over the your teeth you feel that film now brush with our toothpaste Crest now rub your tongue over your front teeth that was the best problem that's like an easy to understand like oh I see exactly what you mean well in this this solves it why that one's even better is when you get to be the one diagnosing the problem you have way more Authority and you're basically creating a new problem category for people that they weren't fully aware of and so this happened is why I like gut health a lot five years ago I didn't hear anybody talking about gut microbiome leaky gut I personally leaky gut I'm sure there was something I love that phrase it's beautiful branding I have a family member who's just like oh I'm super worried about leaky gut and I'm like what and she's like yeah I bought every book I watch these YouTube videos and dude it scares the [ __ ] out of me and like now I drink apple cider vinegar I do this I do that I'm like hmm interesting somebody just like created a problem taught you about it you might or may not have it no way to know it's a beautiful bunch of solutions and it was branded in this way that sounded horrible I don't want a leaky gut it's a it's a it's a speed it's a it's spooky it's what it is it's a spooky phrase just like cleansing it's like I'm gonna do one of juice cleanse like bro I don't think like this juice is like a pipe cleaner and it like is going through pipes I don't know if that's how it works so I um so I bought this domain drink guts.com and I have this idea of this brand called guts and guts is basically a drink that uh that you drink for it's like it's like a protein powder and you drink it for gut health and um it helps with digestion so a lot of people who are either constipated or going to the bathroom all the time uh it helps with weight loss it helps with sugar control helps with those those sorts of things um so yeah so I think I can incubate this brand and I just need an amazing marketing CEO and so I'm looking for that um have you uh have you heard of Ollie pop uh I've heard of Lollipop I've drank an ollipop before yeah so ollipop is basically it looks like a soda or a Seltzer it looks exactly like this I'm drinking spin spin Thrift right now it's just like water with a little bit of fruit in it it looks just like that except it says like probiotic on the can yes which always turns me off by the way I'm like nah turns me on probiotic dude no who's antibiotic you dude I'm antibiotic I'm not probiotic I'm neutral on the biotics at least but I'm definitely not pro but uh you know how do you feel about accidents are you pro-oxidants dude Michael Scott said he goes I wouldn't say I'm superstitious but I am a little stitches uh uh lollipop do you know how big they are I think they're huge dude I see them at every grocery store 100 million plus and they're doing a new one by the way poopy or poppy using this one no it's like an even more uh it's like a gut health soda or like a probiotic like Lacroix and I see that one popping up at Whole Foods dude when I think probiotics I think diarrhea like you're gonna do something to my poop like yeah I think that's where the branding opportunities come in uh to to fix that guts doesn't exactly help your cause here I know but I think it's a loud um splashy name that can be almost like so bad it's good and uh I don't think it's very trademarkable I think that's the the problem with it but I kind of want to work with a designer just to make a fake CDC like packaging of this I kind of want to crowdsource this idea through MFM so basically I'm like let's find a marketing CEO through this I have I have a guy in mind um let's get somebody who's a design agency like let's make the packaging for fun and uh and see what we could do somebody who's like a supply chain guy let's go find the formulation lab like let's just like crowdsource this idea I think that would be like dude here's something I want to test so this what you're saying reminds me so we're in the 55th minute or something like that of this pod and you're saying like something where you want to you're saying a call to action I'm curious how many people you're gonna get last episode or two episodes ago I we were talking about my Airbnb and I said marathonranch.com I go yeah if it's Airbnb you can see that marathonranch.com and I just kept talking uh I was curious how many people went to the site um do you have a guess oh I mean I would guess it's low I'm gonna give you the homie yes I don't know 100 visits so we set it at minute 38 or something like that like not in the beginning it got like three or four thousand views and uh not one not one booking by the way not one booking not one to be clear yeah one time I shared it on Twitter and I got two million impressions not one booking so not one booking so it didn't help me at all but I'm curious I bet you you'll get maybe 15 qualified people messaging you one time you talked about this thing you wanted a woman to holler at you for this woman brand that you were working on and people started hollering at me to get to you and like four of them were like Instagram women like models like wearing thong bikinis and [ __ ] like trying to reach me to to talk to you and my Sarah was like I saw my phone I'm like dude this lady like she's like what are you looking at I'm like check this out this lady just dm'd me try to talk to Sean it was it was a pretty funny yeah I also like that you say holler at still uh it's like is that still saying tight when I think something's cool I'm a Dank I'm trying to bring dank back do you remember dank TRL when I get home from school so um you can just email me Sean seanpuri.com I'll put it in the show notes of this like in the description of the podcast too um I heard an assistant that just reads all my email and triages it into buckets that's like uh action item needs a reply read this and in case you're interested and then um she filters out a bunch of crap I went from being horrible at email like I I don't see stuff I should I see a bunch of stuff that's trash I forget to reply to things I'll read it on my phone thinks to reply later never never remember to come back and reply later I had a horrible system and now um shout out to my assistant Andrea who's uh helping me so much with that it's it's like literally overnight Game Changer well I got an email from her saying Sean would like to schedule time to speak with you in Vancouver and at first I was like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] are you kidding me there's some current videos yeah really uh and then I was like okay this is awesome and I message you I go who where'd you get this person from very interesting she did a good job so um by the way your call to action thing just reminded me I think we should do two things uh uh two upcoming shows I'm gonna put it out there now it's time for another drunk ideas episode uh which is where we come up with ideas that only sound good if you're drunk so half-baked kind of bad but maybe good startup ideas so we should like the very long distance girlfriend the best one ever yeah exactly very long distance Girlfriend Was An Old Timer um the second one is uh I think we should do our version of The Bachelor so I think we should get mfm's most eligible uh guys and gals basically submit your application we need a photo we need we'll we'll put up we should put up like a dating site which is basically like um uh we ask a couple questions and then we take the best and we present them on uh on the show and then people can reach out to them and they will get like a bunch of inbound of people who want to actually date them and let's see if we can get somebody married out here let's see if we can get somebody to fall in love the second time we've done that by the way we've had one MFM marriage but did you um divorce yes and that's not a joke but then we take it away did you see when I did that on Twitter where I like tweeted out like 10 of my friends who were single and yeah that's a great idea we should just do that as a crush it crushed all right I'll uh tweet that out after this uh let's do this by the time this comes out let's make it like Ben texted me he wants to do he wants to call it hot millionaires in your area um what can we call it so what should we call it it could be uh maybe something with singles maybe something with uh uh let's see what else I don't know we got to get you're a good name right no no no don't give up you could do this I don't know we could change the word singles with shingles is there anything there that's the thing that's always at the bottom of the website it's like hot singles in your area so just call it that like it's hot singles in your area too much competition on that name dude that's that's the most competitive term on the Internet it's got to be like uh um MFM Most Wanted and but it's most wanted because you you know they're wanted in a dating sense yeah we get it we get it mfm's Most Wanted that's fine that's actually great that's actually great we're gonna do that and then better than shingles I don't know I like I like changing words you know called Twitter [ __ ] uh it's classic and then this month Sean we probably should do like a merch thing yeah I'm working on it I'm going all in on uh on uh just creating great content I don't understand what content has to do with merch uh it's like merch's content to be like we're not gonna be a rich selling T-shirts but we can make awesome t-shirts that are like as good as great content like it makes you laugh it's interesting it's cool it's fun it's you know it's it's meant for fun not meant to be like uh you know our patreon all right I'm down no offense people on patreon little [ __ ] yeah dude I don't want to be like I don't have a patron um all right that's the pod [Music] thank you

did you Sam have you heard the story about how the Mormon church has a hundred billion dollar hedge fund yeah that kills my eye yeah that was that that's old right that's from 2019 or 2019. exactly um and Ben you're Ben you are uh I don't know how to explain it you are Mormon you are a member of this great business you are a patron of the business um that we described uh first so far Ben have I offended you not yet okay great let's fix that keep going so you're saying this chance [Music] all right we're live uh dude you're wearing the brightest sweatshirt it's like bothering me almost I'm here and I'm ready to to shine bright like a diamond Rihanna Style oh diamonds actually this kind of looks like Rihanna's halftime outfit a little bit if I just had the belly bump it would I'd be there some would say I do I I wouldn't say that Subway but I wouldn't I had to take the shot before you did there no I'm not gonna I'm not gonna you're not chubby anymore you're uh you're strong so you got your [ __ ] right bro we I've got a couple things to cover that are pretty good I think you do too yeah I'm look I'm locked and loaded all right do it what do you got it's amazing what not running another business will do to you so much so much time to um to work on this podcast okay I want to tell you about what I think might be the greatest business of all time okay the greatest business ever I think this is the greatest business ever and I'm going to convince you of that uh let me let's just walk through before I even tell you which one it is let me walk through the criteria for a business like this okay so if we were going to describe the greatest business of all time what would be some of the you gotta have attributes what would be some of the attributes so the iPhone LTV high high LTV so you want a customer around for a long time that pays you for a long time okay great uh what about like let's say I told you there's a high LTV business but it's only been around for 18 months well you'd be like I don't know not a long operating track track record or history here so you want longevity right you want longevity years what if I told you this business maybe been around for a thousand plus years without obviously you'd be interested in okay let's get to something are you gonna tell me that there's tax tax advantages too this business doesn't pay any taxes okay I love this no taxes how does that sound I like that I like it even better if the government would subsidize it that's a thing but yeah that sounds great to me yeah I like that kind of mom had to come back out for this one okay um cost structure what if I told you you basically don't employ anybody volunteers do all the work and there are franchisees essentially that pop up to sell your product and just pay you a royalty wouldn't that be quite nice I'd say hallelujah I love that what if I told you you know you might say well what's the balance sheet look like okay you've told me the p l is fantastic but what about the balance sheet well what if I told you that these types of companies have uh this this this product this business has not just billions of dollars but but often tens of billions or hundreds of billions of dollars in assets on the balance sheet with no liabilities wouldn't that be something you'd be interested in I would be very interested in this yes I pray to God and I would thank that God that that gave me this idea you're a product guy you love product it's all about products hair products any product any type of product you love it this is a product beloved by millions has insane product Market fit people use it daily weekly didn't even need an app they could just use it in their head it's that good even if there's evidence that it it's a bad product if if somebody said hey there is no proof that this product works they might they would not care they would not care they would not hear a word of that they would like it even more baby in fact in fact it drives them together uh what if I told you this product spreads By Word of Mouth what if I told you that some people would not only teach their kids but they would leave their house go to other people's houses knock on their door and tell them about this product that's how much they believe in this product you're going to be true core issues they're morals they're ethics their Community their self-development what if I told you that the product is so good it not just guarantees you a good life today if you use the product but not but in your afterlife when you die you might go to a nice special place where you'll be happy after you die that's how good this product is eternal LTV I'm in what if I told you it touches every part of your life cycle from when you're a baby to when you're old and dead how you pay for your funeral and everything in between your marriage um you know give away part of your salary to this to this company just because you feel like it and uh it's a part of everything in between what if I told you this this company not just sold this product but also had the number one best-selling book of all time this sounds like the Crips and bloods like a gang but even better your blood in blood out I love this you love real estate they also own a [ __ ] ton of real estate so tons of real estate okay so let's let's review billions in Revenue tax free with basically no customer acquisition cost and super super high LTV it's a product that solves the core need spreads via word of mouth and the people who use it believe it use it daily day to day week to week month and they're willing to Die For It people run this business with volunteers and franchisees it lasts for a thousand years has Network effects it sells an information product there's no manufacturing even involved it's got the number one book of all time and the Tam the market size is every human from birth to death how would that sound because religion is the greatest business of all time and I want to tell you why I got excited about this but how was my rant that was good I uh I uh I knew where you were going because I'm I'm you know like I'm born and raised Catholic I I catch there's you're stepping in I'm all about this you smell what I'm farting you know you picked up on that one quick so to talk about this because there was this news article that came out um or like there was like a wave of news about this recently but actually there was like a whistleblower thing in 2019 and Ben Wilson you're gonna have to come on to talk about this did you Sam have you heard the story about how the Mormon church has a hundred billion dollar hedge fund yeah that kills my eye yeah that was that that's old right that's from 2019 or 2019. exactly um and Ben you're Ben you are uh I don't know how to explain it you are Mormon you are a member of this great business you are a patron of the business um that we described uh first so far Ben have I offended you not yet okay great let's fix that keep going so you're saying this a chance um second Ben what uh can you explain this 100 billion dollar mega church fund uh or sorry Mormon church fund and uh what your reaction to it was when this dude's broke in 2019. yeah I don't know how deep you want me to get but the the Church of Jesus Christ popularly known as the Mormon Church uh tithes it's uh its members so we all pay 10 of our income to the church and but not only that the church also has a number of businesses associated with it uh has um and a lot of this has comes from over 100 years ago when essentially the Mormon Church Controlled Utah so it spun off a lot of those uh businesses it basically doesn't run businesses anymore but what it did was create basically a [ __ ] a big hedge fund and because of its association with the church that hedge fund does not pay taxes and has done really well and now is worth as you pointed out over 100 billion dollars yeah could the hedge fund be invested in just public equities as well yes like can you just do normal wow so basically here's here's what the here's how the hedge fund works so uh so it owns 40 billion worth of U.S stocks so companies like apple Microsoft yeah uh Facebook things like that they can't own stocks that are like seizures entertainment or like a Starbucks they don't they don't own that because of the caffeine or whatever so they they they select something don't they own a Coca-Cola Microsoft Apple Facebook they have Tesla they made eight million dollars on the GameStop squeeze when that was happening so that was pretty cool um they also own two percent of all the land in Florida which is kind of amazing they um they basically grew from 40 billion to 100 billion just from 2019 to today uh uh for or or sorry from that was from 20 like 12 to 2019 so like in a seven year period it kind of doubled there uh they also invest in hedge funds they own 100 Million Dollar Hotel in Maui they outbid Bill Gates for like 200 million dollars of land in Washington uh so land stocks hedge funds um this is what they do and then they've donated uh 64 million dollars to charity since 1985 so that's kind of where the knock on this comes from which was the the the complaint was basically um wow that's a lot of money um it's just like why they're homeless when you all got this that's like that and why are we giving 10 of our income when maybe I actually need that money right if it's going to this massive stockpile and then that's not being redistributed to this and then the answer was like they called it this is where there's some all-time Alzheimer lines I Gotta Give I gotta give credit to whoever these people are in the church that are giving these lines out I mean you to say these are the straight face is amazing they go it's a rainy day fund so this 100 billion dollar fund is a rainy day fund and actually it did start out like that that was the initial intent I believe like in the 70s or something like that when it started it was like all right for every six dollars we get we'll put five towards you know operations and furthering the mission and we'll put one away for um for for the rainy day fund but then maybe it's still a rainy day it's just their household now has 100 or 200 or however many hundreds of millions of people it is instead of whatever it was but there's not that many members I think there's Ben how many members of this like 16 million members or something like that it's not that ballpark yep yeah it's not that many members um they uh overall overall they uh uh this thing is just sort of ballooned up and so I think they don't know exactly how much members contribute every year some one guy said seven billion in the whistle blower report seven billion there's like some historians who think uh that's too low it's probably closer to 30 billion gets contributed in per year so there's a there's a bunch of like kind of uh there's a lack of transparency that's the second complaint um because not only was this not openly discussed like that's why a whistleblower had to come out and say hey there's this management company called Ensign Peak and enzyme Peak is take getting the money from the Mormon church and deploying it and the enzyme Peak is now has 100 billion dollars in a management and they're not being open about this and they said well we didn't want people to know how much money is in there because then they might not feel like contributing so that was the first uh first line the second one is like well how come you did it through these like 13 shell companies so that nobody could track you know what you're investing in and how and you bought this mall and you bought the stock what's going on here they said well we we obscured it because we didn't want our members to try to copy and sign Peak and maybe they would mismanage their funds not having the same info that we have and so these are just like I just love the the you know the sort of the repartee here between between people that that were running this thing so I thought this was kind of amazing and it was just staggering that they've accumulated this much wealth from a very small base of uh of people and that's why I kind of had this realization oh man religion really is the greatest business ever invented and um you know there's five big ones and then they they sort of dominate in the same with the same sort of they all share these same benefits and characteristics you're Hindi or Hindu is that what are you nothing I don't I'm not I'm not a Believer but yeah like most people in India are Hindu and is there no Central Hub there's no organization you know like the Catholics or the Mormons have like a like a crew you know you don't got an HQ I don't think there's I think it's more decentralized uh than that so I don't there's no like there's no like the church like nobody says that I don't know I don't know if that means there's not one or what but there are many many like temples that are sort of like the Vatican that get tons of donations and people make the pilgrimage and uh there's tons of you know uh shadiness around that too where like you know we went and you're in line on this mountain to get to the top to see this like statue and then it's like hey 100 bucks cut the lime and it's like the guy who's taking the the bribe essentially the cut cut money he's like a priest and so they don't even like obscure it's like the guy comes down in his robe and is just like oh yeah your family your family come here come here uh we want to give you a special uh special treatment you know do you have some something to donate and then you're like yes and then he's like cool cool come on come to the front of the line and they found like these guys have gotten raided and they're uh like these gurus and sort of like uh you know leaders in of these temples and they have like it's like oh open up your master bedroom and there's just like piles of gold it's just like yeah yeah just like you know it's a gold storage facility actually it always so I went to Catholic School my whole life so K to eight or no K to 12 and then I went to a real another religious college and so we used to go to church three times a week Catholic mass three times a week it was like Monday Friday Sunday for since I was eight until I was 18. and every week your mom and dad write a check and they like someone comes around and like collects it right and I remember hearing about this like all-powerful God and how smart he is and it's like you know this guy's the greatest you know he's just he's brilliant you know like he created us and like you know we just came from his hip and all this stuff and like we're just magical like this guy's magical but he's really bad with money you know he he he needs and he needs more of it he needs more of it and he's just he can't get enough of this money and he's really bad with it and if he loves you but look if you don't give him money you're gonna go to hell where you burn free all eternity forever but he loves you and he needs [ __ ] money that's [ __ ] guy man it's like the worst Uncle ever yeah he just needs money he comes scratching his neck he's like hey [ __ ] yeah oh yeah look what he got I think anything you got you know literally just give me change you gotta change I'll take a change you gotta check I'll take a check and now you can even venmo him and I just remember being at church every Sunday thinking this guy man he ain't so good with money but he's all knowing but he but he can't he doesn't know which stocks is short because he could not figure this out he needs more money um there's also another little side thing before we get off this religion tangent uh Ministry brands have you ever heard of this PE firm yeah yeah yeah are they the ones who buy software companies for churches yeah they brought them up 30 30 Church related software businesses and it does 100 million in ebitda so 100 million essentially a profit before taxes um just on this roll-up which is kind of amazing I mean it's sort of a billion dollar billion dollar Church roll-up which is uh Church software rollup which is pretty awesome all right I have a story for you well let's stick with Scandal and uh like a negative stuff because I got a good one disclaimer the product of religion genuinely is great it genuinely helps people I'm also just saying that the business of of religion I think is amazing from a pure business point of view and also a little sketchy to me but I don't think the product is amazing and the Believers you guys are awesome and Ben you're awesome you're you're super awesome and I hope we didn't offend you I I have you didn't offend me still haven't offended me but I just like final word on this which is kind of the Mormon perspective on our 100 billion dollar hedge fund which is um the the leaders of the church uh so like the prophet the apostles their salaries got leaked um by some people who were disaffected members of the church who want to make them look bad tell me more what you got you guys want to know what you guys want to guess what the salaries were 300 000. that's pretty good I would have guessed 200 uh 200 170 I well I'm I believe it was 170 000 a year um and they get like a car which is usually like a Toyota Highlander and why a highlighter that's that's like the specific is that like Pious that's like that's like I don't know they just own a bunch of Toyota stuff there's no cup holders can't put soda can't put soda in it my dad was one of these people who who was getting this he was a clergy so he you know he's a Stanford MBA was making a bunch of money they asked him uh would you come work for the church so he takes you know like a 90 pay cut and goes and makes this and he had he's driving around this is my point Toyota Highlander just like very middle class and so the point is no one's getting rich off of this even the people who manage uh the hedge fund kind of get paid below Market rates right they should get paid fine they get paid well but less than they would make it other big hedge funds that are doing equally well that we know of because because with the Catholic thing it's a little bit different right the Catholics on the Catholic side it was like oh this whatever Bishop took 17 private jet rides last year and there was like a bunch of things like that so so maybe in this case it wasn't or maybe it was more obscured where the benefits come from and not just so obviously on payroll like but but I know that with other religions that also have a big balance sheet also have huge revenues and tax exempt status the perks were sort of substantial but this is why it seems like it's a bigger controversy outside of the Mormon Church than within it a lot of people like myself or we hear about it we're like well I wish it was 200 billion you know like it doesn't bother us the church says doubling down on it yeah take 20 of my income yeah dude well not everybody I mean one guy sue you know one guy famously was suing them for five minutes he's like I want all my tithing money back because I was basically under the impression this was going to help people uh or like expand the church did he get it and that's it lawsuit for five million dollars and uh I don't know if that's been resolved yet let me let me tell you another interesting the controversial story so we talk about software as a service we've talked about SAS we talked about a few other type of as a service products I want to talk to you about psyops as a service meaning psychological warfare so this story I'm basically uh uh my researcher here he's around here uh on the on the um uh eugino he's here on the Riverside so he might have to pop in if I get something wrong but I found this article that blew my mind and was totally underplayed and I thought not talked about enough so I'm going to be recanting a bunch of this story so nothing here is crazy original but we found a bunch of articles that we kind of timed together so basically this starts in the summer of 2022 and a bunch of journalists from all different newspapers kind of teamed up to uh to to write this story but it basically is a um they went undercover and they found this company it's called team it's it's pronounced uh I actually don't know how it's pronounced but it's uh j-o-r-e so maybe Jorge I'm gonna call it team George like George like George mosf it all uh but we're gonna call it team George um but it's team George and it's this Israeli company that does psyops as a service and so what that means is you can give them one to ten million dollars and they'll basically hack stuff for you and this company it's based in Israel they have employees this isn't like uh like the guy who runs it has a LinkedIn this isn't like a a criminal Enterprise necessarily this is like a legitimate company and I want to tell you this crazy story so it starts off they're a private they call themselves a private intelligence agency they charge anywhere from 50 000 to hack someone's phone four hundred thousand dollars to have their services on retainer six million dollars to get involved with a uh uh an election six million to meddle in an election is hilarious that that's on the menu dude and the guy gives like these crazy stories so the guy's name his name is talhanan so he's the guy he's like the CEO the founder and he does this like crazy stuff and so basically their three-step part process is to gather intelligence construct a narrative and then deploy Maximum Impact all wonderful phrases and so I'm going to give you an example so this guy Tao he's the head of Team George he's in Kenya with these journalists who he thinks uh work for an African government who wants to hire them to do some work and at the seminar or at the meeting where he's pitching his Services he shows his phone tal shows his phone and he's talking to a person who's supposed to be an African government uh consultant or something like that and he goes here look check this out I just sent your mom a few messages from your telegram account and the guy's like why he goes yeah here's my phone look I'm logged into your telegram account I hacked you already and and so they do these crazy things where they offer these ridiculous services so they do they have this tool called a profiler which is Can it can create all these different fake social media accounts and so what they'll do is they'll figure out what uh what story they want to conch like who they want to hurt what story they want to construct and then they use these fake social media profiles to make it really popular and they have something like I think it was like 50 or six or no sorry 39 000 of these profiles out there and so here's like a handful of crazy stories so here's a couple examples so the clean that uh the team claimed to have a sex toy delivered via Amazon to the home of a politician with the aim of giving his wife the false impression that he was having an affair thank you my love it was a wonderful night waiting for you whenever you come back write a note Inside the Box the wife received the package and then uh the team George they sent a film crew to film this and they found the politician sleeping in his office for the next two days and they found out who the sender was it was this woman named Shannon and I think she's one of their fake avatars and they found out who she was and she's active on Twitter and on Facebook and has a Gmail account and WhatsApp account but I don't believe This Woman's real and her Amazon card was connected to a digital wallet so they could like track all this and so that's like an example of the things that they do another thing that they do is uh to prove uh the journalists to prove how powerful these guys are do you know who Emmanuel the Emu is do you know who that is have you heard of that person no who's right so there's this tick tocker this lady who's got a tick tock and she's wonderful I followed her forever and she has uh an emu you know what an emu is like an ostrich looking thing yeah like a pet emu that went viral on Tick Tock and she talks to the Emu and his name's Emmanuel well the journalist asked team George to make it go viral that Emmanuel was dead and so overnight they did that by the way started really weird requests by the journalists what the hell were they I don't know it's just weird they're weird strange Choice makes zero sense and it got to the point was where this woman who owns Emmanuel the Emu who I follow I love her that's why I found this article so I saw the story where they're talking about Emmanuel the Emu I've Loved Emmanuel I know all about him I own a manual the Emu t-shirt and the uh for real and they um uh like she tweeted today I saw online that R.I.P Emmanuel the Emu was trending on Twitter so I just want to let you know I had I ran outside to check what was going on he's totally fine I have no idea why this happened right this company they like create all these crazy stories well they'll be like uh hey you know uh one one company will be like hey the CEO of this billion dollar company we need a fro we need something bad to happen to them uh find some dirt in their past and what they'll do is they'll hack into a person's Gmail or Google Google Drive using that they'll find passwords to all these other things and they'll create these crazy stories then they'll use their network of 20 or 30 or 50 000 fake social media profiles to share uh all this stuff and then they'll also bribe some uh journalists or create fake blogs where they'll write these stories and then the avatars or social media profiles share that stuff crazy fascinating and I read this article and it blew my mind it absolutely blew my mind yeah this is really really wild and the you know psyops I thought was like when you use like the social media thing or articles to influence somebody's uh beliefs not just like but like hacking their phone is sort of different um so so it's interesting that they do both um I have a couple quick reactions number one prices seem really low um I feel like they can seem low yeah team George triple your prices this is this is a small voice stuff for what you what your the value you're providing I mean it's only six million dollars to meddle in an election that's it like uh you know I'm thinking shit's bigger than that come on what's going on here so so I don't really understand their pricing 50 000 to hack it to a phone you know how much chaos you can cause by hacking to someone's phone that seems wild so I think that's crazy uh good find uh that this business exists that's my second reaction and my third is this kind of lines up I think I've I feel like this is a thing on social media that people that you sound like a conspiracy theorist if you bring it up but it's clearly gonna have it clearly happens and it makes total sense that this would happen I also know that this happens in the like non-election you know this is basically also done for influencer marketing right like what uh like we've talked about um my buddy Steve Bartlett and how he used to own a huge number of Twitter pages and he would own pages that had nothing to do with anything you'd be like you know um Hermione's favorite books it's like some Harry Potter fan page and they would have like freshman problems they would on that page and like things I overheard in Manchester they would they would own that so they own a bunch of things that if you were like a 14 to 21 year old in the United Kingdom you followed probably you know four to eight of their accounts and so what they would do was when we wanted our app to go to to grow and to our goal was to um to go get a bunch of downloads for cheap we worked with him and I was like all right Steve what can we do to grow this thing he's like well we can use my network and I was like great so just say uh um you know hey this is a great app uh download it uh you know blah blah blah here's the link and he's like he just looked at me like okay you know get out of here get out of the room dad like you know you don't understand and he was like yeah we're not gonna say this is a great app because nobody cares and that looks like an ad we're gonna say like my mom's reaction when she sees me checking bibo for the 43rd time that day and then it's a mom slapping a kid I was like oh well I don't think that's a good image for a new app and he's like no he's like do that and then be like um you know when I you know when I um you know my notifications blown up because of this annoying effing Vivo app and it shows 47 notifications like but you're calling it annoying that seems bad right Steve he's like no when somebody sees that there's an app that has 47 notifications they want to know what it is and that you're complaining about it makes it look like not an ad and I was like but then where are you gonna find the link he's like I put the name bibo in the thing they'll go yeah they're gonna look search for it and he's like then they'll search for it and then they'll find it and then they'll share it because they saw seven he's like when you hear five people talk about something on social media the same thing in a day that you hadn't heard about it feels like everybody's talking about it and that was his core Insight we called this the Thunderclap and we did it and we ranked number one in the end Thunderclap is like the name of going getting popular yeah that's what he called whenever when all the accounts start talking about it at the same time that's great on the same day yeah Thunderclap who made that up you make that up well I used to say that when like you know it's you know if your thighs get together or something like that oh it's a Thunderclap and I just decided to reuse it for a better purpose now so when your thighs get together just messing around yeah we made that up but I think it is actually a social media term I remember looking it up because I was like oh this is genius what do you call it when all the accounts on the same day just flip on and start organically talking about something uh like what is that and it's some other person had made that up so I stole that name off them um but basically that's what that's what these guys were able to do and he used to and we've talked about this before so I'm repeating a story here but like he gave a talk once on stage and goes watch this this is you know whatever I've made up a name like Freddy DB Freddie DB yeah he puts him on he puts a slide on the screen of him wearing like an you know a Manchester United uniform and he goes Freddie DB just signed with Manchester United for 72 million dollars uh one of the craziest contracts for a prospect who's only 17 years old um oh but the thing is Freddie DB doesn't exist and he never signed a contract but watch this we're gonna make this go viral just by the end of my talk this will be trending on Twitter and oh my God he like nodded to like you know one of the like 19 year olds that worked for him off stage he goes they like like launch the missile and that's exactly what they did by the end of the thing it was trending real like you know sort of like ESPN type news sites started picking it up like Freddie DB signs for 72 million because like they're all trying to find information on it but they just publish first because they don't want to be late to the news and it just showed how much influence you could have and so this happens I think from a commercial for like you know just in the business World Plus in this case for like you know political power [ __ ] that's wild what a badass presentation I mean that's like that's a really good presentation I mean that's like a swagger like the Swagger knob is broken it's just stuck on 12. there's nothing you could do we've tried to take them into the shop the hustle we now are read by about three million people a day so we're not a big deal um and we're definitely not like influential enough that one of these companies would be like let's get that company to influence the masses but and like same with this podcast like we're not we're not a big enough deal or we're a Target where someone's gonna or at least I don't think so or someone's back I'm gonna trick them into saying this because then they're gonna like actually have uh influence over the outcome of whatever we want we'll make your analytics guy say what happened today but that's it nothing's going crazy yeah like it might be a little bit of note on like your spread your spreadsheet for that day but that's the at best that's it and uh but like I would see a little bit of this like fake news stuff because I would do little tests where I would create like you know uh so my parents do this all the time they'll look up a celebrity and they'll say oh Nick Cannon only worth eight million dollars that's not it's not even a big deal and I'm like you guys like and like they won't even like click the article sometimes they just see like the paragraph text and and I'm like or they'll be like uh their day today or this past weekend I was with my father-in-law and he's like oh look if you Google it it says the worst way to sleep is on your belly and it's like because we're talking about cancer yeah yeah I'm like you guys realize like like anyone can write these articles and I can make them show up and so I used to write these articles about net worth so like Ross Albright the Silk Road guy I would write an article about his net worth I would just [ __ ] make it up I'd have no idea what it is I would just make it up and I would track my analytics and people would start linking to it and I would start getting traffic and that happened a lot of times or there'd be times where I made errors in articles and I noticed I would see that same air in on a few other people's websites and you start seeing wow this is how it starts like these little things that's how it starts and so this whole fake news conspiracy it's one of the few things where I'm like no there's actually truth to that like and I have very small examples of that but if you're like a much bigger deal you can find lots of bigger examples of that it's actually this whole fake news thing is it is 100 real and so this story is definitely proof of that dude as soon as you see how the sausage is made in any industry it just really ruins it for you um I remember when we were doing our restaurant startup we were like dude we don't know anything about restaurants like how does a restaurant even work like this is like what are we doing and we had learned a little bit about sushi because we did a sushi restaurant but I was like uh Dan who's my our business partner was like raw fish seems like the best the best platform to learn by the way yeah yeah yeah exactly my favorite sport Russian Roulette yeah so we were like Dan go work at Noodles and Company and go learn their like processed stuff and he's like all right so you did this Duke graduate goes applies for a job at Noodles and Company they're like wow son you you interned at Goldman Sachs and now you're here it's always been a dream to be on the back line and they they whatever and so he used to bring home Noodles and Company every night and we were like dude what's uh so he's like he's like bro the the way they make this the way that he's like the amount of salt in this any of this like this guy that worked this guy who barely spoke English that worked back in a you know like a line cook with him and Dan was like eating the tomato soup and because he's like I'm gonna eat he's like I don't want to get like super fat I mean I guess I'll just have the soup so he's like put the soup in a bowl and the guy just like knocked it out of his hand is it measured in grams no it's measured in seconds what do you mean a second it's like how long do you hold the thing the lid with the can upside down pouring salt for like 17 seconds worth of salt and so he used to tell us like dude don't eat the [ __ ] and that's how I feel about everything like um when we sold a milk Road to Mike and Kendall these guys are they come from an affiliate marketing background and so what they do is they make websites that are like news or blog sites that rank at the top of Google and they're the authoritative example like they were doing it for um gold buying gold online and so they were like should I buy gold or the price of gold over time or should I buy gold uh coins or bars and so whatever question you would ask they wanted to be the number one result the other guy did it in for for sports betting so it'd be like um you know is it legal to gamble in the state or like you know what's the best place what's the best place or what's the safest place to do X and so there you go during this time Google so as I met them and I was like okay so who else does things like this and it's like dude have you ever Googled anything like every top result in Google is the same model like oh you you're worried about that uh whatever like that that thing on your elbow yeah Google that oh you found Healthline cool yeah hellfind seems like a great website right super helpful for you you're making a medical kind of decision on whether to worry about this or not off of Health it's owned by an SEO company it's like Red Ventures yeah it's like oh this rolls back up to Red Ventures and so does this credit card website and so does this other thing you want to know what's the best credit card don't Google it you want to know what's going on with your health don't Google it because not only is their model that they're just gonna write whatever's gonna Rank and then when they rank they're going to promote whatever they get paid on as an affiliate and they'll try to say no no no we just say that what's the best and if they happen to be an affiliate they happen to be an affiliate but we don't let that affect our editorial rankings yeah right [ __ ] that's how you make your money you're going to promote the things that'll pay you a bunch of money um and so dude we used to have like a TV in our office which the person who had the most page views that day like things like that so it's like what does that make the writer's room do oh yeah yeah get more pages dirty thing like I don't think there's a malicious intent it's just a natural incentive is all I'm saying which is that if your natural incentives that one company does not offer you an affiliate deal and the other one does you're probably not going to put the one that doesn't give you the affiliate deal as the number one best choice you might put it as number four right and so the editorial thing has been slightly smudged with that um and so you see this with everything and then you're like Okay cool so who's writing these articles it must be like you guys have all these doctors on stuff or uh not a chance and that's an SEO specialist and some upwork yeah you know the writing our best articles and you know we pay him 19 per day I'm just making all these numbers up but like you get the idea this is like it's basically what ranks in Google is somebody who understands how to rank in Google which is not the same thing as the person who has the right answer and once you see how the how the content gets made once you see how the tomato soup gets made at Noodles and Company you uh become very you know suspicious or skeptical of things which has you know pros and cons I would say all right well sorry everyone so uh what do you got next topic what else do you want to [ __ ] on um okay let's do a quick one and then I have another one um I put this thing in here the work smarter not harder hack I sent that to you you said this okay this is amazing explain what this is so uh no you explained well we just need a life I sent this to the group chat because I thought it was hilarious this was really funny a guy at bar stool basically is a guy who works at Barstool um or sorry barcel retweeted this but it's kind of an ad so there's a a tweet we will we'll play it in the in the YouTube video If you see it but like basically there's a guy who goes out to like a party and he's just looks like uh he he he's wearing no shirt he's like in Miami somewhere it looks like and it looks like he's live streaming and so he goes up to this girl she's like no way 50 000 people are watching this oh my God and then he's like yeah what's up guys all they want to know what you know what's the craziest place you've ever been she's like um um she's like panic because 50 000 people are watching and then she's like how are you so famous yeah and he just like doesn't answer or something like that and then he just does it's a montage of a bunch of people reacting he's like going into the club and he's like yo what's up y'all we're at this place and the guy's like hey go ahead VIP and so basically it's all fake it's just a fake live stream uh screen and so it just looks like you're live it looks like you're on IG live it'll say live it'll show 50 000 people are watching this the comments are flooding and you look like you're some sort of celebrity but it's that's all the app does it's called parallel live I think it's a real app by the way it's real I'm on it right now yeah by Big Brain it's LLC work harder or sorry work smarter not harder yeah that's like everything I try not to get jealous anymore but I'm jealous I didn't think of this app to be honest with you because by the way I did this when I was younger we did a version of this that made sense back in the day where we paid a guy to walk around with a camera behind us like we were on a reality show like an on the shoulder camera and we were like dude I bet you like you know we won't need to do anything tonight we don't need to pay for stuff we don't need to approach people we don't need to wait in line watch and uh it's sure sure enough it played out completely that way and so I I was sort of on to this idea you know more than a day 15 years ago now and uh I think this is so smart what a great idea dude my best friend Neville so you can Google this so Neville Medora so n-e-d-h-o-r-a so Neville madora one year during South by Southwest so Neville's Indian but he's from whatever part of India he's from he looks Persian so uh one year he um he uh wore like uh like these stereotypical things that you see in the Middle East of where it's like a white you know like what do they call that a white gown with like a book oh yeah yeah with like a head cap thing and he basically looked he's like I'm gonna look like a middle eastern Prince like that's my goal tonight and his other friend I think it was Noah and a few other guys wore black suits and he he said they walked around South they walked around in the evening on South by Southwest and he goes we got in everywhere they thought I was from the Middle East and I had uh like I was this king or Prince and I had people coming up for me up to me constantly and like uh his friend Noah would like Whispering a girl's ear like hey this man wants to speak to you and they like kept up this [ __ ] going for a while and if you Google it you'll be able to find it but um dude this type of these types of pranks are my are my favorite what's the play the clip sometimes you just want to do hood rat [ __ ] with your friends but I wanted to do Hood right stuff for my friend that's what this is this is a app that lets you do hood rat [ __ ] with your friends parallel live genius big brains LLC I went and looked at what other apps they've made there's one thing called a relationship one right a relationship tracker and it's got 17 ratings and two stars um you know this is you can almost see the the um the development of an entrepreneur go to their App Store and it's like starts with like productivity app to-do list um you know bus tracker to be more efficient um oh something that helps you save your you know your favorite memories with your family and then it starts to become like Hot or Not uh fake live stream simulator you know get laid tonight exactly um so you know that's like it's like eventually you stop selling what you want people to do and you start selling what people want to do I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better [Music] um all right let's do one more thing what do you got um I had a fun meeting I want to tell you a little bit about so I went and met up with uh James Courier who is an internet OG I know this guy I like him he runs something called nfx now which is a big fund like they have like a billion he's a 1.2 billion under management or something like that oh I don't know so it's grown a lot uh back in the day he started a company called tickle uh here's another example of you start by doing what you think you should do and then you at the end you give people what they actually want so tickle started off doing um cycle like psych quizzes so it'd be like you know um I forgot what's that thing called Briggs Myers and Myers-Briggs or whatever that's it I think originally for like which jobs are you built for or something yeah things like that it was like trying to like help you figure out what you should what career you should do blah blah blah and then the thing that went viral was what dog breed are you when you take a quiz it's like you're a Husky and you're like oh that's so cute I'm gonna tell all my friends about this it went super viral and then they started making more and more silly quizzes eventually they sell the thing for for about 100 million dollars to monster um or kind of like a good A great win uh in the early internet days and then they did a bunch of other things so they've and they kind of like it it invented a little bit of the of the uh internet virality if I remember correctly your old boss Michael worked with them and I think like Rick Marini was there too who Rick Marini now owns what's the gay dating app uh that went public uh grinder Rick Marina Rick mourini owns that yeah well he owns he didn't start it no he didn't start it but Rick Marini uh owns or founded the PE firm that eventually bought grinder and I think they either took it public or they sold it to someone and it went public some something like that but it was like a pretty good day yeah yeah yeah so these guys are all about they've been doing this from the beginning and if I remember correctly like they invented little things that we like take for granted today or things that don't even work anymore like for example uh uh enter in your Gmail here and we'll email all of your friends to ask if they also want to join along this thing and they grew that way uh yeah they basically were like kind of um they were early to the viral game and so they bought Mike so Michael Birch who was my former boss and an investor um they bought his first social network Ringo and what Michael the way Michael described to me was he's like I built this social networking thing uh it grew to like 300 000 users which was like really big at that time and the internet's like that was like a big internet thing he's like it was crazy so much money to run it uh pre-facebook didn't know what to do with it didn't know nobody thought social networking was gonna be like a money making thing it just seemed like a kind of time waste he's like so they offered me a couple million bucks I sold it I worked at tickle for like nine months or something like that and then I um I was like you know I learned a bunch of things through sitting in an office with these really smart people and when my earn out was done or my my non-compete was done I went and I was like now I know how to do this right and he built bibo which got a million members in nine days using everything he had learned during that period and ended up selling for 850 million dollars and so um yeah they kind of were all this cluster of people that were doing the early address book Imports and how to measure if I reality with the K factor that sort of thing um so I go meet with James and uh what was the premise of the meeting so the premise of the meeting was just catch up so he knew that I sold the milk Road he was like you know what do you think about doing next and I was like I'm not sure let's uh let's chat so he invites me down to Palo Alto and so it could have been a zoom but I was like no no Sean's leaving the house today uh let's go meet belly to belly here and and I think it's it's going to be worth it totally was totally was worth it so I go down there um first thing I noticed was like his office is right on like whatever like University Ave or whatever that is in Palo Alto where it's like everything is there it's like right in the middle so I just kind of noted that observation I was like oh that's interesting that he like made that choice could have been somewhere else bde that's that's big dick energy second thing was um there wasn't really anybody else in the office but like he was there and uh I think other people may be working remote so we sit down we start chatting and um I wanted to give you some of my notes from from this thing so the first thing is um he's uh have you ever met him before yeah he's like he's he's really nice and can have a conversation but he's like a quirky uh not quite I wouldn't use the word eccentric but he's just like uh uh he loves this network density stuff and it's like [ __ ] sharing stuff I don't know I mean he's very academic almost about it he uh yeah personality wise he's got a great Vibe like he's very lighthearted uh and yeah himself too seriously like you know I even wrote this I emailed him afterwards which is a little life hack by the way I emailed him afterwards I was like here's my notes from the meeting people don't usually do that they don't hey they don't even take notes but like if they do they keep it to themselves but if you actually send the person the notes they really appreciate it and it's almost like it's a double meeting so he sent me like a revision of one thing so here's my um can I read you my takeaways from from the meeting I go here's here's my my notes five big takeaways I like your lifestyle so I learned something that's a great compliment too by the way yeah I go I like the way you I like your lifestyle I like how you use your Financial Freedom so he said he spent four months a year with his kids um so it's like just four months out of the year he's with his kids they travel they do his stuff and he's like dude that's the max your kids will want to be around you he's like I have teenage kids like that is I'm pushing the boundary of like how much I can max four months in one turn like summertime per year yeah no no like spread out okay probably a couple in the summer and then whatever the rest uh he's writing a TV show for fun right now and I was like like that want to do things like that I think that's dope that you have a life that lets you do that noted uh because I'm uh he's 55 I think and I'm 35 and so you know I'm basically looking at like I'm always hunting for blueprints like who's got a gold lifestyle and not their whole blueprint but like part of their where I want to cherry pick it's like Costco I want to go around and Sample different people and then be like Oh I like that I like the way that Sam has his Ranch and how he does things and his like your home gym for example I went to your place Austin your home gym was awesome and then I came home and I was like Sam what'd you use for the floor what'd you buy for this how do you get the leaves out what do you do this and you gave me the thing and I recreated that and you know with a 10 change in my own how's it going is it awesome oh dude it's amazing yeah and so like that's that was what I stole from you and then did you get the cordless leaf blower the leaf Blower's dope it's also a great party trick by the way people are just like uh if people people love it uh but it's super effective it's way way easier than sweeping so uh so anyways I was like I like your lifestyle for these reasons I I told him a bunch of stuff um then I go then I go the second good thing he told me he goes I think I could say this let me say let me try to say this without causing any uh a ruffled any feathers here so he's like where do you he's like where do you want to land in the uh the status game so he's like okay so he draws this like line on the board he goes on one side of the spectrum you have like let's say garyvee or like 500 startups or like he's like you know think about like people who go for a like a mass market like Tony Robbins they try to reach like a mass Market type of individual with their content and um and then that becomes Their audience that becomes their deal flow so you know if if a really popular person sends me like oh here's a startup I got pitched I'm like he's like I kind of know where that's gonna be in the quality filter versus if sequoia or Benchmark sends me a deal like I know where that is and the quality filter that's on the other end of the spectrum they have a much more Niche audience they're only creating like nfx he creates really Niche content that's for like an A plus founder who's trying to build a billion dollar company using network effects you're referring to nfx the blog or nfx they're customer base or both like the blog is to attract a certain type of founder he doesn't need a million hits on a video he needs like the right hundred people to read the thing right um so that they think about nfx and they learn from and so um he's like we're on this you're you're making content but who's your customer are you more like McDonald's or you know we're like a say a Michelin star restaurant they're like McDonald's you know we're not going to get the volume that they get but they're not going to get the quality of clientele we get you know so we're he's like today MFM he's like is in he's in the middle here he's like and my advice to you is don't slide down that way he's like because today I like you guys and I tell people to listen to you guys because you're like you keep it real when it comes to entrepreneurship like hey you guys are real entrepreneurs you've done it before B you just tell it like it is see you don't talk about the most like complex subjects you like simple businesses and and you know more achievable business models for most people but you're not yelling at them to hustle harder you're not just hustle porn that's just saying like bro you need to grind and like you need to do whatever and then motivational because we try to be motivational and we're not promoting paths that are like um you know drop shipping and like you know flipping things on eBay or whatever like you know there's a a business class there where neither nor are we saying like Enterprise SAS isn't like the main thing we talk about either so it's like yeah we're somewhere in the middle he's like I think you should stay in the middle because it'll be tempting to slide there to get more views but I don't think that's what you're going to want in the end because that will be the network you create those will be the deals you get those will be the people who like you those will be the people you meet and so you will your your content will Define which network you're a part of today you're here you can kind of go either way um you should either stay there move up Market but like he's like my my advice to you is don't don't slide down Market there so I thought that was interesting nobody really talked about that and there's also like um you know I hadn't gone through this exercise recently where it was like defining kind of like your your brand like who do you talk to who's your customer and who who do you who do you like to create content for and initially the thing I thought about was like usually it's like oh you know I'm all about entrepreneurship I'm all about starting your own business and that's what I did and that's what I like but there's many different flavors of that there's like Tech startups like more like YC there's stuff like starting an agency there's different stuff in between and then there's some people who are like they cater to a market of people that are like kind of like entrepreneurs only so it's like quit your nine to five job don't be a slave to the cubicle get out there and Be Your Own Boss type of messaging and I'm like I don't feel like the people who listen to us are mostly in that category like I think the people who talk to often are like second time Founders they're people who are they own small businesses or they they're actually planning to take shots and they're not like they already have made the decision of like I'm not gonna like struggle in this nine to five I don't you know I don't think it's a Dairy Queen worker that's our main like kind of person who listens so it was just like interesting to hear that um okay here's the last thing that I think is two two last things uh one partnership advice so him and his buddy Stan have been partners for I think like 20 years now yeah forever and I had talked to Stan before I met James and I asked him I go hey I want to have a Business Partnership that's like yours like a business marriage not just a partnership like your thing is like multi-decades there's no end in sight and it's been great and you guys have had multiple successes with the same people what's the secret and normally when you ask somebody this like the odds of them actually saying something insightful are very very low but you can tell like how good they are that off the cuff he's like there's four things you need to know oh my God he tells you the four things and I'm like what are these four things so here's what he told me he goes he goes most relationships are um both sides are focused on what they're getting out of it he goes you're he goes the first thing if you want this to work is you make it a giving contest like a giving contest he goes yeah he goes when we sold our first company James owned 90 of it or something like that 80 90 and he owned stand on like 10 or 20 and right before the deal closed um James like evened up the the thing and he was like what uh he's like no no you don't need to do that because James had had I think some financial success right before that or something and so he's like no that's not right and James was like no this is this is right and he's like in a moment where everybody would have been selfish he had every right to just keep the deal exactly as is I'm I'm more of a gift basket type of guy um and I've I've kind of done it both ways it's not about like you don't have to just make everything 50 50. I don't think that's the right answer but I think making sure everybody's taken care of is an important thing when we sold bibo the first time um or when I saw people to Twitch I own double the equity that my co-founder uh furcon owned and so on paper I should have got double what he got and as we're getting close to the deal I told him I said hey uh we're gonna get the same like whatever that total pool is we're just gonna split that 50 50 of what we get out of between me and you because you know that's what felt right to me and uh you know I was like this is I think this is what is this before furcon had was this before app app love and sold uh no that's old but then actually so wow and so for those who don't know Sean's partner helped found App 11 which varies in market cap between 20 40 and 50 billion dollars it's like a huge thing and so you still I mean he had a that was that's probably a home run for him financially the the app 11. yeah yeah I mean the app level thing is way bigger for him than than our deal was um and we knew like he was going to be wealthy from that uh so you know it wasn't I I don't know like I just felt felt it was the right thing to do and what I it was actually it wasn't like dude I'm gonna make it so that we're even that's that's not really the mentality it was I the original deal was not fair and so I just wanted to correct it um like when he joined the company he had like point five percent of equity or something like that and so I had already upped him once Upton twice up to I'd been upping him without him asking anyways just because I was like this first deal was wrong so now I just try to cut the right deal up front so you don't have to do that anymore um but like the point is like you try to do what what is actually right so anyways so that was the first lesson from Stan was like he's like I never feel like uh he's like I basically feel like we are both trying to give more and it's not about Equity only like it's like effort like he's gonna do something I want to do more um he's gonna you know try to like you know make some sacrifice I want to sacrifice the same amount or more let's turn it into a giving contest that was lesson one he goes lesson two when you disagree or you fight which is going to happen a lot and you have to decide which way to go do we go my way or do we go your way don't use logic use the sleep test so he's like I ask who cares who is more emotionally invested in this in this decision because if I'm if we go with my way but you were more emotionally invested you're not gonna be able to sleep at night and if I turn out to be wrong it's going to really hurt you if I'm a little less emotionally invested in this let's go your way and we agree that we'll just you know we'll pivot if we need to um you know later and he's like when it's really like just a deadlock that's how we resolve the deadlock is who's not gonna be able to sleep at night yeah about this thing and when you have that attitude uh you know both sides end up trying to compromise versus trying to get their way um three he goes I think in 20-year increments so if I'm going to work with this person for 20 years what decision would I make today that's going to be the best in a 20-year time Spirit versus how most people operate is they just make a decision today about what's good today and then the future consequences may not be that good but they're thinking short term whereas if if we plan for this to be long term we're going to make different decisions today to set ourselves up for long-term success um so that's number three he goes number four um uh the last thing I go I go hey I asked him I go I go okay that's the partnership Stan why why are you great why is Zuck recruiting her because he ended up getting recruited by Mark Zuckerberg to go run I know this guy Facebook messenger and didn't you go and actually do that he went and did it and he had and they've been trying to get recruited for like years like you know seven to ten years it finally said yes and I go um I I asked him two questions I go uh what makes you great and what makes that great he goes because I'm not that talented but here's my thing I'm not because I don't have the same bias as most people I don't have to be right I go what do you mean he goes when I look at data everybody else I find they look at data and they just they have a story in their head they want to be true then they look at data and try to find will they keep searching through data until they find something that supports their story it goes I look at data and I ask a simple question what story is this telling me and he goes he goes I just keep doing that and I just make better decisions because I do that because that's my approach to to how I actually read data that's why I can have more business success than what about Zuck and on the Zuck side he I go like what makes that great he said you know he didn't want to say the obvious things here he's brilliant hard-working like that would be a pretty blah answer again that's how you know the quality of the person they just skip over the blah answer they give you what you want they give you a little candy so here's the candy he goes I was sitting with Zuck when he decided to buy WhatsApp and everybody said it was way too expensive they bought it for 19 billion dollars and WhatsApp wasn't producing any Revenue what's that worth now you think I don't even know hard to say uh I don't know a lot more though I think more yeah um like the Instagram one definitely they bought it from 1 billion is probably worth 100 now um what's that probably double that sorry but what's that's probably also 100 billion dollar franchise so he was trying to decide to do it and he goes you know what's great about you mark you're lucky you're smart enough to know that you got lucky once and you found lightning in a bottle with this when social networking was going to be a thing but you're smart enough to know when somebody else got lucky too and he goes uh he goes you are smart enough to know that this Mo this messaging thing was like this was the big winner of this era and these guys got it and you need to pay whatever effing price you have to pay to get it because there's only going to be one the way that there was Facebook like there was only gonna be one big winner right and you you know that you don't think you're so genius that you're just gonna out-compete everybody and beat everybody at everything like you're you can recognize when somebody else got lucky too and uh and I thought that was just like a fun answer for her for her did he say that he liked did he like working with Zuck uh you know he's not gonna tell me if he hated it and he but you know the action speak louder he's been there for quite a while I think he's I think he just left this year and so I think he was there for like seven years or something so how did this guy run nfx Labs while working at Facebook he didn't he just worked at Facebook and he came as an advisor and then James was like again no problem go do that take the big fat check I'll run on FX you keep your partnership dude how much does a person like that make like if you're the head of a Facebook person uh a Facebook business are you making over 10 million a year I have no idea yeah yeah for sure you think so for sure wow I have no idea I say for sure like I know I don't actually know what he was making but I would be stunned if it was less than 10 million a year I think it's probably closer to 20 million a year that's so much money there are people at these companies that make 40 50 billion dollars per year uh like because they had stock grants early on and they just stayed there no no no not the early on type person like they'll get a package in 2019 that at the 2019 prices is going to pay them 20 to 40 million dollars a year they're usually like the top AI guy because they're like look this if this top AI guy leaves and goes to another company not only do we lose this Talent that's kind of Irreplaceable but then Google gets them and then you know now they have a problem so like Google has published some of these numbers about guys were making like you know 30 40 million dollars a year I want to have a I don't know if this has to be anonymous or what but I want to have a conversation with one of these kind of OG guys who saw the Twitter Facebook's uh like some of these companies get created Google like get created because you know they're around they're and they're probably only 50 or 60 years old you know the people who saw Google like who are a little bit older when Google was getting started I want to ask them all stories about that and just what's it like being around some of these people and what are some of the stories around when it was getting going like you hear these crazy stories about like I think we had I think we had someone on here talk about eBay and they're like I joined eBay when we were 50 people and they were just explaining what like the day-to-day office life was when you're adding 50 employees a month or 50 employees a week when you're only at 50 people and uh anyway I because this type of stuff doesn't it truly exist anymore because the map the playbook for for a fast Growth Company is kind of it's not entirely made and there's still companies like uber that are recreating it as they go but like there's a story there and you have a history but if you're Google you're a little bit of a Pioneer and you're like I don't know man how do we how do we add bodies to this problem I don't know but anyway I want to hear I want to get some OG's on to tell those stories yeah that yeah that would be awesome um I've heard I've been lucky to hear a couple like uh the guy who was the my boss at twitch essentially was uh semi-early at Google so he would be like you know Larry says this he's talking about Larry Page like from Google and so like he didn't do it often but like he would say these little things that I would like ask him a million questions about it dude so when my wife my wife Sarah worked at Facebook from 2000 and I feel like forget exactly maybe 13 to 16. and during that time Facebook I think she was she joined at like 5 000 and then when she left there at like 50 000 something crazy and during that time Zuck would do these meetings every Friday in like an auditorium or in a cafeteria on Facebook's campus and any employee can could show up and just ask him a question and they would also stream them and every once in a while I would like look over her computer and watch her streaming these uh conferences and there'd be like 50 or 100 people in the cafeteria asking questions to Zuck and I'm like Sarah you are crazy you should be in that cafeteria every single Friday like this is like being around like John Rockefeller or like Teddy Roosevelt or JFK like this is like a pretty big deal and if you just ask an interesting question every Friday maybe eventually he'll say something like Sarah it's nice to see you again you know like why don't you just come talk to me afterwards and we could help maybe you could work on that price like fan fiction yeah he'll still sleep with you and then I'm like creating this story in my head I'm like what could potentially happen and uh it never happened to each other in the elevator and he says yeah right you have like a meat cute in the cafeteria and he like says like nice shoes and like you already know you're like boyfriend I want to hang out with who knows and maybe you're posting a bunch of pictures of me and I just so happen to like play Bobby that's him I don't know I haven't thought this too already but like like I had this whole Playbook and she didn't do any of it and instead we just had a traditional fall in love marriage and all that boring she's like a yoga class during the All Hands yeah we could have had a throuple with Zuck but no well dude this is this is one of the other things that James was talking about actually like to kind of actually relate to that he goes um I asked him I was like so um I asked him about his office member I told you I was like I noted that he was here I was like why do you have the why'd you get in office right here he's like I mean it's a no-brainer if he goes uh he goes I made one mistake when we sold tickle I drew a diagram he goes he drew a circle he goes on the diagram guy I like this oh dude if you if I'm gonna meet you in person we're gonna be on the Whiteboard like you know that's what's gonna happen yeah it's going down yeah it's going down you know I'm a lady in the streets and a freak on the Whiteboard and um and so he's he draws a circle he's like yeah they'll say that he's like the white hot Center of Silicon Valley was like let's say Sequoia Benchmark these you know these people these Founders at that time Facebook was just getting started Facebook was like the hot Center of like where all the action was happening Google it goes and then like you know one ring out from that you know we were kind of like adjacent like we knew a lot of those people like I helped you know you know I advise some people to take jobs there you know I had a job offer there he's like I didn't take it because I've maybe had a little too much ego I thought I was an entrepreneur probably should have just joined Facebook it would have been great um he's like yeah but we were like one one hop away we were like one one ring away in this like Circle it goes what we should have done is realize that Silicon Valley is a network and in a network like all the value like a lot of the value concentrates at the core like the closer you are to the center of the network the more value you get physically in many cases as well literally physically which is like he's like he's like uh he's like um he's like the further you go out the the more you're on your own Island he goes we decided to go start our own thing our own lab self-funded doing our own startups with new people and like you know doing our own thing and it felt so entrepreneurial to go out on our own terms and build our own Island he goes I he goes I could see you making this mistake too because I wish somebody had explained this to me at the time he goes and you see this all the time you know um he goes I can't believe people are moving out of the tech people are moving out of the Bay Area to go live in Austin or you know Florida or these places uh You're Gonna Save 13 on your taxes but make 10 times less money like you know that's the trade that they're making they just don't really buy that and he goes um when we did this because when we moved out here you know when we decided to go off and kind of do our own thing not physical it's not geographically but just like in a philosophically all of a sudden he goes I had a meeting with a meeting schedule with the Uber Founders because you know they were in our Network and our friend was like you should meet with the Uber guys Travis is doing something cool and um had the meeting scheduled but I was so focused oh I'm doing my thing here and I got busy and I had to I just canceled the meeting didn't take the meeting um missed Uber would have would have definitely invested in it at that time just because in the network as our friends put a small check in you know no big deal but I was so focused on building my own little island I I stopped paying into the network it goes you know similarly I could have took a job at Facebook at that time been like you know one of the earliest people at Facebook I kind of knew Facebook was going to be a big deal um but again had my own thoughts about what I wanted to do so I went the other way and made things harder for myself rather than easier he goes you could see what like the value of the network he goes when Facebook started getting popular Facebook started in in Boston and he goes Zuck was smart and Peter Thiel told him the right thing which is get your ass to you know get your ass to Silicon Valley as fast as possible because the startup that builds this in Silicon Valley is gonna have a better shot better High expected value than one that tries to do this on their own in a new Talent Network you know at a new funding Network outside of Silicon Valley and um and I was asking about YC I go well didn't kind of YC do their own thing he goes no I have the opposite view of IC YC is fully a network and he goes Paul Graham did the first one in Boston and immediately moved to Silicon Valley because he had figured out oh [ __ ] this is the blueprint for for investing in early stage startups that's going to work whoever does this in Silicon Valley is going to be the winner and he goes guess what they moved to Silicon Valley right away as soon as their first batch was done Paul has two little kids they just forget drop everything pick up and move like he's like you know it wasn't convenient for them he's like I know the architect that was building their house and you know they had to get there quickly and they just rushed it moved in start their second batch in Silicon Valley because they look at all the other accelerators that copied their exact blueprint the all the you know Tech Stars is the one in Boulder every other city and you know they've had like a couple unicorns Paul you know has had 100 and it's like you know the difference is like a you know more than a 10x difference in outcome just by being in the center of the network and he goes um and I saw it so I was thinking about that I was like you know there's a physical location part of that then there's like staying in touch with people so like me doing that meeting with James was great because like yeah this guy's in my network but I was just sitting in the burbs over here you know doing my own thing here creating my own content do you not feel like a Silicon Valley guy because you're dude I haven't been going to anything like I don't meet with anybody I don't go to anything it's like dumb and then this brought my awareness to like wow I'm silly for not taking advantage of the network that I the hard Network that I've built over you know 10 12 years um that's crazy that I'm not taking advantage of that um and then so I asked him I was like you know what do you think uh uh I was like how do you actually take advantage of the network besides physically being there okay I believe the physical thing and I've always said this like proximity Is Power the closer you can be to the people you like and the people you want to be like and the people you want to be around like literally physically the closer you could be the better and I go why does that work and he goes he goes what you should do is that you want to build something that brings value not only to you but also to those people around you also you want to be like an API so like you know when a when Twitter is a product they create an API that lets other people like read the Twitter stream write create apps that help Twitter like this makes Twitter stronger it makes Twitter stronger he's like you want to be like an API you want to tell you want to tell people how they can plug into you where can they get help from you how can they give help to you like uh if we know that Andrew Wilkinson buys internet companies then when we see it internet company we talk to some guy who's like yeah I'm thinking about selling we'll make that introduction because Andrew has an open API he has made it clear how somebody can interface with him how somebody can help him and how he can help other people you know he he's made it clear for those Founders hey if you want to exit I'll I'll buy you out and so he's like that's why Silicon Valley is great because you can invest in other people's stuff you can join them you can partner with them you can work for them you can send them Talent you can do a podcast exchange you can share ideas about growth with each other you can share knowledge about a term sheet which is like that's why Silicon Valley works is because the network is super dense and people share a ton within that and so you get all these extra benefits that you don't really plan for that are sort of serendipitous when you're in there and I I thought like this is all obvious like I kind of nodded my head but it brought my awareness too it's not that obvious a lot of people don't take advantage of this stuff and even me who still who knows this stuff and still lives in silica Valley I wasn't maxing that out and I'm gonna make a you know a a sort of like turn that knob a little bit and do that better if I could I only live Where I Live Now for family reasons but if my family were willing to live in California I would be in Palo Alto not San Francisco actually but pal I would be down the peninsula in a heartbeat totally 100 I would be there in a heartbeat I think it's the greatest and people say like well it doesn't matter anymore I'm like well maybe like currently it doesn't matter that much but things that maybe in the six or 12 months it's going to be happening but I actually think it has kind of happening still a little bit but uh I think New York and and and Silicon Valley are a little bit on uh even actually now whereas for years they weren't but still Silicon Valley I think has a much better uh you have a much better existence living there but I would be there in a heartbeat if I could if it were if I was a single guy I would be there tomorrow right um cool all right I think we went a little over but that's it that's it that's the pod [Music]

somehow five years later covet hits and you know what they decide to do they're like you know what let's go all in on creating like safety safety stuff for covert like masks respirators um gloves things like that and they become one of the like core providers right at the start of covet they shifted all their production manufacturing stuff they're like forget the vodka bottles forget the LED screens we need n95 masks and we need respirators and we need you know these testing kits and we need and they started producing this stuff and they started just winning all these contracts [Music] we're live Sean uh we have a bunch of stuff you you have a you have a a full menu over here and so do I yeah all right I want you to look at my menu here and I want you to just pick something off the menu go ahead and I'll Riff Off it we don't prefer people who they don't they don't know we only write like one or two words so you get like a teaser you're like man what the hell is this about but you don't know what it actually is but I have I put all my stuff in here an accident I have this new researcher who's crushing it he just gives me all the content like five minutes ahead of time but uh Rich neighbor how did I know you'd pick a rich neighbor so there's somebody in my neighborhood who I bumped into and I've just I'm you know I sort of get out there and I collect signals is this you know where where do I place this person on the uh the Billy scale like are they you know are they on their way up are they are they have they made it in life are they really balling out of control where where is this person these people have been balling out of control like when Christmas time came up there was just like the wife went outside and it was just pointing at windows and all of a sudden the house was lit up like a Christmas tree they had like so they had almost like decked out things and they go hey hey um invite your kids over uh this Thursday we have a snow machine they're we're building a Snow Hill in our driveway like uh you you want to do sledding without going to Tahoe what's that like a big snow cone is that what that no it's like a giant truck that comes that creates snow and it piles it up so that your like their house looked like it was in you know Michigan or something like that yeah but it's just like like it's like an ice machine or something yeah it's like yeah something like that yeah like a big snow cone like a big shaved ice thing yeah yeah you were right from the from the beginning you're right so they did this and they had a fake Santa there and I was like man this is a lot for a Thursday afternoon but okay uh this is cool like these people's style they seem really nice and I didn't know what they did so I kind of I hit it with the Google the other day and I was like let's see who these people are and they have a crazy story so they created a company that back in 2014 did this thing it basically it lets you take a vodka bottle they had a vodka bottle that had an LED sign going around it so you could give somebody a vodka bottle that would say happy birthday Sam or like you could program any message I could be like you know uh whatever I could be like you're getting an old [ __ ] whatever I could write any message on it it would go on your your vodka bottle all right seems kind of gimmicky I don't really you know not a bad idea but but balling out of control from that didn't didn't 100 make sense but that was it sounds like a Drop Shipping like joke sounds like my first idea out of college it's like this is like me in college would have been like bro next next Google I got it what if we took you know this Jager bomb and we put an LED screen on it wouldn't that be incredible and so so they had this thing and they were like licensing this out or something like that somehow like Shaq became an advisor to their company it was really crazy it makes sense yeah as you would five years later covet hits and you know what they decide to do they're like you know what [ __ ] this vodka thing let's go all in on creating like safety safety stuff for cover like masks respirators um gloves things like that and they become one of the like core providers right at the start of covert they shifted all their production manufacturing stuff they're like forget the vodka bottles forget the LED screens we need n95 masks and we need respirators and we need you know these testing kits and we need and they started producing this stuff and they started just winning all these contracts and so now like if you go look at their website it's one of those I know your Rich websites because there's like not a lot of information on it but if you go to like the P they have like a press release section and it's like PR Newswire company gets 113 million dollar contract with the government for safety equipment oh my God local East Bay success story where they uh they're now the the sole testing provider for you know with the Lakers Stadium Levi's Stadium like all these different places and so these guys are getting 100 million dollar plus contracts for their stuff now I think probably it's like you know probably only like 10 margin when you buy you think it's that selling masks I think for things like that probably it's like 10 15 is my guess maybe maybe during coven everyone was completely price insensitive and they could just charge whatever they wanted I'm not sure I would have thought that but um but wow dude what a what a pivot and uh you know that isn't that just kind of crazy and that was an opportunity kind of available to a lot of people right dude I know a bunch of people who did that and like I had a friend that did it and he's like dude check this out and he sends me a picture of a Shopify store and it's doing like 2 million a month I know a lot of people who did that and I've only followed up with one or two of them and uh I have a feeling that like of the eight people I know who did it like three of them it worked out and then the rest it was like a really quick cash grab but then they over bought inventory and it and it's like nothing do you know people who did that yes we there was a guy in um I had started this Mastermind group that's actually where I found Ben uh but like one of the other guys in The Mastermind group he like every time we came to the testimony does he live in Texas no he's in Canada every time he came to the Mastermind group I feel like he had a different business which is like not what you want in a mastermind group but he was a good dude and he would always be like oh I have this other business that's like oh you know for auto repair blah blah we do their SEO and I was like okay but then what about that thing you told me last time and then one time you came dude we're doing mobile covet testing trucks that will drive up to places and we can just do rapid testing for covet and we were like all right I mean that sounds cool but like are you like do you know anything about covet testing like does anybody in the world know about this like what he's like oh I got the scientist that's going to be great and then he came back and he was like hey um really excited to be here I need you guys help um like three months later he was like I really need you guys help about going public and I was like and he's like yeah we're gonna do like 85 million this year in revenue and I was like what and he's like yeah we're getting all these contracts with the state of uh with like the you know the [ __ ] in Canada like these country Country-Wide contracts and um you know yeah we think maybe we should take this public next year and I was like oh my God so how did it end I I don't even know because I that that guy my head was just spinning every time uh you know he would talk because I'm like this is either too good to be true or I'm too dumb and this is amazing and I can't tell which one it is it's probably some mix of both but you're right I know several people that went all in on covid right when it happened and like low-key got like an absurd amount of traction very very fast yeah like a ton my dad had actually called me one day and he goes my friend works at this hospital they need extra equipment they need extra masks I talked to somebody in India and they could produce these masks and like I think we could do like a two or three million dollar contract and I was like fantastic um should do it and he's like yeah I wanna but my dad has this problem where my dad is addicted to meetings like he thinks winning is like this important person met with me and then he'll tell me the duration of the meeting to show me the value he's like only scheduled for one hour but we sat there for 90 minutes and I'd be like okay so what like everybody so you know he was really interested two hours right and he was just like he just like always just obsessed with that so he was he just had a bunch of meetings and I was like Dad you're gonna it's all about that action boss you're gonna take some action here what what's gonna happen like go go for it do it and he's like well no I want he's like I want everybody to like sign off on it and de-risk it completely pay me up front and I was just like dude this is this is like the cheap way to do business like you got to take a little risk here you're throwing shade on your dad right now I hope he doesn't listen to this and you called him boss if I said Cosby boss he's getting in the headlock yeah my dad yeah we make fun of each other like we call it like it is I do a bunch of dumb things and I say when I do dumb things this is his dumb thing he is high planning low action on these things and he says it all the time like um we went I went I took him to Tony Robbins and Tony Robbins is all about like taking massive action on like the things you want and he's like I was like what's your big takeaway he's like oh man I need to take Massive Action and I was like that yeah that's that you did it you learned the right lesson from this thing he goes that's my problem I don't take Massive Action I was like whoa he started slipping back into like basically he's like I've identified my problem just like so right so true whatever it worked out for him yeah he did he did great like right for like Village in India to like live in like owning multiple homes dude the story great the story of you tell of your mom of like I think you said she like had never eaten with a fork or something and she just comes to America when she's 17. is that what you said I'm not exaggerating I thought you said I thought you said like she had they didn't use like utensils or she went to a restaurant and like or she actually you're right you're right that did happen no I'm not being disrespectful uh Mrs Perry that's this is the story it's on record and then also when she used a pay phone to call her brother to say that she was in town she didn't know like that you hang it up so she like let it hang yeah and then she she was just crying at the airport and some guy was like hey uh do you need help are you okay she's like I need like my brother's supposed to pick me up I don't know where he is like just landed in America and he said you have a phone number she's like yeah so he that guy picks up the paper film puts in the quarters calls the brother tells him hey she's at Terminal Two she's waiting here I'm gonna tell her not to move brother didn't even know oh your flight was today like you they had no correspondence like okay oh hang tight I'll be there and she talks to him and she's like he's like don't move and then that guy had left the helper had left and so she didn't she's like not only did I know how to use the Payphone I didn't even understand how do you put this back and she's like I kind of was like fiddling with it like kind of like like trying to get it to stick and I didn't know what to do I looked around nobody was there and I just left it hanging and I walked away she's like I'll never forget like just feeling so clueless about the world um and there's like five stories like that on her just yeah they got to America now they have a house in San Francisco so it worked out that's the uh that's the American dream um um all right another topic what do you got I got a quick one here so I saw this Tick Tock of this uh Professor uh some professor at College uh I apologize to her I don't know her name but um let me see if I can find it real quick she basically uh Professor Cooley I don't know what she's a professor Cooley at Emory University so shout out to her basically her she has she teaches marketing at um at this college and for her marketing class she goes all right glass um if you want to do well in this class you want to get an A you have one job go viral on tick tock all right I'll see you I'll see you in a few weeks like if you need help you know we have some maybe maybe some uh we can talk about what it takes to get there but like that's how you get a good grade go viral on Tick Tock awesome how old is she young looking or older younger looking um yeah she looks like you know she looks like if you were 12 she would be your friend's mom um got it all right so something like that whatever age that is perfect description so whatever so basically uh I thought this was amazing and it got me thinking like really how many more classes at a university should be taught this way um so for example like why isn't there a classic you know why isn't there a class at school where it's basically like okay we're gonna have four lemonade stands on campus break up into teams you're each gonna run a lemonade stand like and you know the top lemonade stand is going to get an A plus the next one gets a minus B plus B minus um and if you if you're not able to break this threshold of sales you fail and it's like just let them go and do their thing and let them learn 100 how it should be or it's like you know maybe it's the net profit so to learn about the cost management as well but like give them you know 500 bucks and be like go who can run the best lemonade stand or t-shirt company or whatever it is or writing on Twitter um like you know okay it's an English class should you basically go read Shakespeare and all the stuff or should I basically teach you how to do writing in like the modern day and basically the cold email newsletter cold email or Twitter and it's like yeah you need to grow an audience around whatever topic you're interested in it could be The Bachelor it could be World politics it doesn't matter you pick your topic but you got to write to an audience on that and you got to publish first thing is quantity you got to publish every day for the next 60 days um and then the next thing is going to be quality can you actually grow an audience can you get you know 50 open rate on a newsletter with you know a thousand people on it go figure out how to do that and so things like this I feel like would be so much better than the way that people learn about how to do real world business today in school another one would be flipping like uh everybody you're gonna look under your desk yep you're starting with this drill okay everybody's got a drill like your job is to flip this drill into the most valuable item you can get by the end of the semester go and it's like you got to sell this take the profit buy something else sell that and like just keep doing that until you can get to the biggest thing dude uh Ramon our friend Ramon his son goes to a school here in Texas and he his kid had a class where he had to go haggle and it was like you have to get this much of a discount from a retail store or something like that and I was like Ah that's awesome that was awesome it's like great for a 12 year old so I love that stuff I dude I didn't have CL when I was all right my sophomore year of college I was a division one athlete a runner nonetheless a runner a Peak physical condition they'd made me take a aerobic walking class which was like if you add up the tuition it was like nine grand or something like that so I'm on it was aerobic walking you show up and you go for a walk so I'm all in favor of this stuff I think it's awesome like are you walking at least at like a fast pace why is it called aerobic walking versus just walking is that just branding is this the gym teacher how to justify their their their pension or their uh salary I don't know it was the stupidest thing ever like it was it was crazy it was crazy to me I had to take aerobic I remember this it was ridiculous uh you just like showed up what do you mean you had to seems like they don't force you have to get like these certain amount of credits and it was like this aerobic walking classes was your major like PE why why was this because they make I don't know I don't remember exactly why I had to do this no I don't even remember what I majored in I think just like accounting or business or something it wasn't so I left school early so it was accounting and then I and then I left school and then I finished online later and I was like okay you know give me just give me any diploma that I can get please because um I moved out so I the summer I had to take like some summer classes and one extra semester and uh I heard about Airbnb and I was like that's where it's at so I wanted out there yeah yeah so you you know I think I told you this I had heard about how you applied I didn't know you were in college and dropped out for it I didn't drop out I well I I don't know if it's technically drop out I just like quit going and then I finished online like I couldn't move it to an online student yeah like I took like some time off and then I eventually like finished and I would have to go like to a Kaplan you know like those Kaplan like testing centers and I would have to take these nonsense nonsense tests but basically there's this famous runner I was runner at the time and there was a famous runner named Chris lukasik and he quit running which wasn't exactly lucrative but he was like the seventh most fast fastest Miler ever and he was like I quit I'm quitting running at my Peak to join this thing called air bed and breakfast and I was like what the hell is that that sounds awesome and so I uh emailed Joe gebia the founder of Airbnb and I was like hey uh I I like Airbnb I came up with this interesting hack that I think could help you grow uh here it is and he forwarded it to it was at the time there was this thing called rapportive that had just come out and I built an Excel sheet where you could type in someone's first name last name and like their Gmail or their company name and then it like permutates and you put into this thing and it tells you which email is there so not like that sophistic of a hack at all but it was like new technology and I emailed them and in his head he's probably like this is dumb but like the fact that you came up with this like whatever we'll interview you so the interview and so he puts me to a minion the minion was like hey do you want to come to the Bay Area well I don't know who the guy was but the guy is probably worth a really underused word I'm gonna start using that that's an amazing slander I love it well that minion is probably worth 20 million dollars I mean you know because at the time they were only like 200 people and the guy who he referred me to was like the 17th employee and so his name was Justin I'm still friends with him sorry Justin call you minion but maybe you were like that's your friend I'm friendly with them but he uh they uh they go all right great do you live in the Bay Area and I was in Tennessee at the time I didn't know what the hell the Bay Area was when he said I had never been west of Missouri I'd only basically been to like Missouri and then like whatever the states are when you drive to like Destin Florida for like spring break those are like the only places that I'd been and he goes are you in the Bay Area and I was like of course yeah it goes great come into my office on Monday so it's like [ __ ] I gotta get out there I gotta figure out what the hell the Bay Area is I thought it was La so I pack up like yeah like Silicon Valley I heard someone make a joke about Silicone Valley but that was like where like porn is I think in L.A I I they're all the same to me I didn't know and so I Googled what the hell the Bay Area is and I bought a ticket and I flew out there and I interviewed with him on a Monday and a Tuesday and then I interviewed with Joe the founder he probably didn't even remember me because it was like a 10 minute interview and then I go home on a Wednesday they offered me the job on a Thursday and then a week later I I called my mom I go dude I got this job this is awesome and they go what the hell is this you stay at someone's home I go yeah I think it's gonna be legit she goes it sounds like a multi-level marketing scheme and I'm like well they have like health insurance and she goes whatever and so my mom drove down and packed up my apartment with me and then shipped me off and like she like gave me a thousand dollars and that was my seed money so I moved out there and this was all in like a three-week span the Sunday night before I'm supposed to start they call me and they go we busted you man you lied about your resume because you have a criminal record at the time I'd gotten arrested uh for DUI and I was like well technically like I'm still like the trial's still happening so like I didn't get convicted yet and they're like yeah but that was it isn't until proven guilty yeah they're like but that was sneaky like we asked you if you've been charged or whatever and I was like you're right I'm sorry so I didn't actually get the job I was hired for like a second but I never had my first day and then fast over two years later my wife ends up going to work there and I remember walking around I'm like uh my alma mater my old Stompy grounds so I never ended up working there but I had a job there for like you know a few minutes and uh you know it could have been something great I would think I would have been like employee 200 I don't know maybe I would have made some money or not but that's the story of Airbnb that's an amazing story I love that and while out there I also had to like take these classes and I remember I didn't have any money I had the thousand dollars that was my my money and I used to have to take this bike and I lived in the dog patch in a warehouse that was 900 a month and I asked her right I live in San Francisco they're like he lived in a dog patch warehouse It's called Dog Patch it's like uh real part of San Francisco by the water and I used to have to ride my bike because I didn't have any money and I had to ride a bike that I took for my roommate all the way up to Twin Peaks to go to the Kaplan like place which is like six miles away literally up the steepest Hills in San Francisco and so I used to have to do those classes and take tests for like months it was horrible but it worked out and now you're here incredible and now dude I used to uh like I like I I learned how to like get get rid of like you could jump on the bus and like when they they would catch you all the time and they'd be like where do you live and I'd be like I don't know uh what's your name and I just like give a name and they're like do you have any ID on you I'm like no I don't have ID and so I remember like there was Zero countries there's zero consequences there are zero consequences I mean That's how little I had like I didn't have cash for a bus fare which is 250 but uh uh yeah it turned out okay what did you do to uh to grow that thousand how did you not just wipe out like because thousand dollars doesn't get you very far in San Francisco so how did you not wipe out in three months on my so when I went to the interview for Airbnb I stayed at the cheapest Airbnb there was which was a bedroom in this guy's house and he had told me he was starting a business and so when I moved back out there I go hey dude uh I don't have a job anymore can I join you I only have like two or three weeks of like payment and then and uh my mother and father had given me a pickup truck for college and I asked them to sell that and they sold it so they gave me four thousand so I was like all right I got like three weeks of rent or three weeks of like living expenses now I just got this influx of four or five grand um I've got like six months of cash let's do this and and so I started I co-founded a a company with this guy a roommate matching company where we would uh post ads on Craigslist saying we were hosting these roommate parties where we would match people up into three and four bedroom apartments because normally it's like uh you're a single person who just moved there don't know anyone so you got to move into a existing bedroom and there's lots of competition so we would post fake existing bedrooms and get 300 people to apply on Craigslist and be like hey this doesn't exist but we'll team you up with 200 other people who Wanna the same [ __ ] as you and we would host these parties and we would charge people money to attend those parties and after they got an apartment and so we basically spun that up on Weebly and made money right away and that's how I lived amazing uh wow great stories I love this uh I feel like yeah I feel like there's a bunch of I've heard bits of these but not all of them uh this is great and I would ride my bike to like collect these money I would knock on their door after they got the apartment I'm like hey you got my money it was ridiculous uh that's so good uh after this I have to go get a hearing aid and uh I'm gonna get fitted for one and I have to tell you why I forgot to tell you this we are at the Vancouver thing and there is these two women speaking to me afterwards foreign and it was loud so like the problem with my hearing is I can't hear the difference between background noise and the person speaking for me it's hard to tell the difference and these women were talking to me and you probably noticed this I lean in hard so I'm only deaf in one ear but I lean in I lean I turn and I and I I get really close to you and also it was just super loud After Party by the way it was like it was like a club it was like a club it was loud and I also stare at people's lips so I I'll either stare at your mouth or I'll lean in Mr really signals over here the horrible worst signals at this moment comes up to me and I'm leading in and like I'm starting to get really close and I can tell she's really uncomfortable and I I go oh I I'm sorry I forgot to tell you I I'm deaf I can't freaking hear you that's why I'm leaning in so hard and uh it was at that point I was I told Sarah I was like I gotta go I gotta get a hearing aid I can't I'm making people uncomfortable this is why you bring your wife with you to all events just to like you know totally totally make it clear what's happening here dude and I a rule I don't I don't travel alone I love having her around when I travel but that is that's definitely the icing on the cake is having around for that reason yeah yeah you you did the opposite of the billionaire hug you like you went in with the with the Brooke boy lean yeah the broke point lead I'm just staring at her lips and she says I literally tried to watch as the words come out of her mouth and just staring go down her lips and looking and then leaning in and oh man I can tell she was uncomfortable I was like oh I forgot to tell you I can't hear so I'm gonna go get one of those things did you ever learn that like trick from this might be it might have been in like those pickup artist things I'm not 100 sure but you're looking at their the triangle yeah yeah yeah like the third eye or something like that no no it's if you ever wanted if you want somebody to want to kiss you you're close if you let's say you're close you're in range and you want to like kind of almost like hack their little like biology and get them to want to kiss you you you do this like triangle so you basically look at one eye the second I down to the lips back to the first eye so he makes it it traces like a little triangle and if you do that you'll just see immediately the person just pucker up maybe yeah right it just happens um yeah right I don't know if it's because you're signaling that you want to kiss them or that it just makes them want to kiss you but this [ __ ] works this was like in college I was like you know you would have thought I'm in the Illuminati how many triangles I was throwing up everywhere because I was like this is like a magic trick this thing is amazing did you get any girls in college probably you're really charismatic King baby you had a good batting average but not a home run got that lead off never got a second yeah oh well that's good the hard part two is my roommate was like um just unbelievably good with girls and so he's really good looking good looking guy and he was right here right yeah Trevor he's an athlete and he's just like a professional flirt and so somehow this guy was just pulling crazy people like you know you have like an RA who's like the the person who's like four years older that lives in the Freshman dorm he just started dating the Ra's girlfriend and then like you know he started dating this girl on the basketball team and started dating like all these seniors started dating this like one really rich girl who's giving him gifts all the time I was like I don't know what's happening here but like um you know this guy's definitely sucking up all the the alpha male energy in this room and uh you know I'm just sort of here along for the ride but it's okay it turned out all right uh well you know you worked out all right by the way my dating life was a lot like my startup life it was basically like fail fail fail fail fail home run it's like you know like most people in their career they sort of get this like 10 raise a year or whatever where it's like this linear like steady climb up the ladder but if you're in the startup world you're often like making nothing or in debt or bro and all of a sudden for like seven eight years and then all of a sudden you're rich and uh that's what my dating life was like I was broke for like 10 years and then all of a sudden I was rich 100 same it like it didn't it didn't start picking up until my 20s it was exactly you're trying to get what were you trying to do in your teens bro I tried I tried a lot trust me I tried I just I looked like Napoleon Dynamite I I with braces it just didn't work out dude I didn't talk to a girl I was sitting there reciting lines from The Rock in WWE when I was in my teens bro I was I was jumping off the top rope in my bedroom trying to you know just I love wrestling and basketball and stuff I didn't have time for girls when I was like 15. it was a numbers game for me I knew like you know three percent conversion therefore you know you got to try a hundred times right yeah you never want more of attrition to describe it whatever I it worked out we both it worked out for both of us before we get into this we got to remind people there is a gentleman's agreement except this time it's different so we have this thing at this podcast unlike everything on YouTube and on Spotify and all that stuff our content actually isn't free you're only

gentleman's agreement we're not on the other side so you just have to do it and everyone's doing it lately so you should do it and that's what we expect out of view and also do me a huge favor and actually click follow on the podcast app and Spotify because those help us actually go up the rankings and then we go up the rankings we get more dopamine and we do Dumber [ __ ] and that's why we're here so do that um I have a story for you so go to joop.com so it's j u p e Jupe so it's jupe.com okay they have a slick looking website so tell me what you see I see some sort of like Mega tent Contraption I don't know what this is this is like some sort of structure it's like is this like a like basically like an outdoor unit that's uh not like something more than a tent but less than a house so I met these kinda I met these guys recently and they're really fascinating and so basically the one of the founders he's like this artist type he's his name's Jeff Wilson and before this he like wrote a book because he lived in a dumpster for a year like he like slept in a dumpster it was like some like art project as well as like to show like for what I don't I don't know I mean he's a wacky interesting guy but he lived in a dumpster and then he uh then he started this like prefab house I guess it was like marketing for like a pre pre-fabricated homes or something like that and um they eventually launched this startup it's called Jupe and I originally saw it because Gary tan famous investor billionaire investor Gary tan made this YouTube video where he stayed in one of their things and so basically what it is is it's I don't know they would be mad if I called it a tent but it kind of looks like a tent but basically they ship it to you on in like a a huge container and you pop it up and on the inside it's like a fancy or like a nice mattress and then there's like a heating and cooling unit and it's got lighting that's all solar powered and so it's like a standalone like house and the way that their business model works is you can do one of two things you could just buy it for 30 grand outright or you can do a thing where you they give it to you for free and they take something like 40 30 to 50 of the revenue and you rent it out and these things are renting out and I was like I don't know man who wants to stay in this thing and he was like dude we rent them out for 250 to 500 a night and they're always booked and they're trying to pitch it to me to put it on my land and I'm not sure if I'm gonna do it or not but they're it's a pretty interesting thing this year they're supposed to do like 12 million in revenue and it's break even and they've deployed 400 of these things and their future what they're doing is they've got these guys that are just buying plots of land and then putting 15 or 20 of these on there and then dupe the company if you do the profit sharing with them they kind of run it for you so they have like their own little platform and they like will help manage the thing for you but it's pretty fascinating and I've been thinking about putting one of these uh on my on my property I'm not sure if I'm gonna do it or not because I don't know if I want more work but really fascinating interesting idea that I came across I've been loving these ideas where you just make more money off the [ __ ] that you already have so like I have land and I was like should I just like put these all over my place but they look kind of fascinating and I thought you'd get a kick out of it yeah I mean these look super cool and I got a couple credit because I see a lot of these like um like this kind of like I forgot what's called adus or whatever it's like this additional dwelling unit or something um and they're often just like vaporware it's just a render of something that looks sick and what I really like is if you click their Vision tab it opens up a notion it explains what they're doing and four times in this thing it just says here's our thing parentheses not a render here's what it looks like you know after it gets delivered here's what it looks like the next day again not a render like hey we actually build the thing it exists this is real this is not like some futuristic dream um and so I think that's pretty pretty pretty amazing this looks super cool I don't know why you wouldn't do this just for even like the story so uh I can I have an update so my I have this property uh marathonranch.com and you can see it it's doing like uh anywhere from 13 to 17 000 a month in gross revenue and um so it's doing well I'm like making money on my Airbnb finally I got like 40 or something like five star reviews on Airbnb and I finally started going up the rankings and it's been really fun to do and so I'm not sure but I have 20 acres 20 acres of land I'm not sure if I want to like screw anything up because dude at my Airbnb I we have like 20 cows so my neighbor his account well that's true but like people my neighbor owns these cows and they use our property and in exchange we pay less property tax and people like wake up to like a moving cow because they sleep and wake they sleep at all my property for some reason they decided that's the bed and I don't know if I want to like screw that up it's like so peaceful going out there so I don't know if I want to screw that up by having more units on the property but uh dude Marathon ranch.com your photo here you chose the wrong photo you chose like a not awesome looking photo for your hero photo then if you click Gallery you all of a sudden see all these awesome photos it's a work in progress my friend it's a work in progress Ive it's still in beta yeah it's because one of the pictures it you couldn't see the writing anyway it's a whole thing I gotta fix but uh anyway it's going well I I always I basically to listeners I send Sean updates on my Airbnb and he's like oh that's neat you're making five percent you're making five percent return that's that's really that's lovely what did I tell you you were like dude this is if this is five percent or seven percent or seven percent of years it's great I go and I told you I go I've lost more money in crypto than you'll ever make on your Airbnb yeah somehow that felt like a good statement to me that's a man the Airbnb game it's been fun it sucked for a minute and then once I started rolling it is pretty dope so maybe one day you'll you'll be convinced but right now it's killing it I don't know if they'll kill it in like June when it's like 100 degrees but we'll see to me the only reason I would do this is the tax benefits if I bought property um the actual like rental income and or and or slow real estate appreciation to me is not worth it especially given the headache of doing stuff so you said let's say from a financial investment it's only been okay but from a like reward like it's been quite exciting what is the margin so you say 13k a month um gross okay so now we take out what Airbnb we take out Property Management we take out utilities we take out what what how much what's the gross on that so like a like a record month recently was like 17 000 but let's round down to 15 000 because that's what it's been lately so that's gross so I give away so I own the property outright but I assume that I have a mortgage so if you assume that I had a mortgage plus utilities and taxes that's in the 7 000 range okay um I don't have that but let's just assume that I do because I will get one eventually um and then property management is 20 of uh of uh like the 14 000. so if I do 50 if I do 16 000 Revenue three hundred dollars per stay goes to my cleaner so whatever that let's just say that's two thousand so that brings us down to whatever that is what I say 15 minus two thousand that's thirteen thousand and then management gets 20 of that and then the rest I assume it goes to a a property um property taxes and a fake mortgage so all said and done on fifteen thousand in Revenue I'll walk away with only three thousand maybe yeah that's nuts so that means let's see uh we did we have 15 000 so 20 margins yeah it's it's not like it's not kids on the 15. well but I have depreciation so I'm able to like save a fair bit there but um yeah like it's a cash on cash return it's gonna end up being like five or somewhere between five and eight percent but if you assume appreciation which is a big assumption but I looked at the trailing 30 Years it'll probably be a 15 to 20 percent uh annual return if I own it for like 10 years right so but that's a big if so that cash on cash it's only okay it's only okay but I'm completely hands off and I also like it and I've I learned how to do something so I didn't I didn't do everything I didn't do everything right here at all I I think I paid a premium I definitely paid a premium for the property dude I know you paid a premium because if I look at this uh like if I go to the gallery it's got the kitchen with like the white everything's like white and like this one look of wood that I'm just like a sucker for if it looks like this I'm like it's a nice place people yeah we know about construction they're like this is like cheap and easy like you know I would walk into a house and like well this is a good house so I'm gonna pay a premium for this house if they're like why because the countertops are nice and I'm like yeah I mean look at this it looks fantastic looks modern and they're like dude that's that costs nothing like you need to pay for a location you need to pay for square footage you need to pay for all these other things but I'm a sucker for like just like the countertops but I have 20 acres and so my my plan my plan originally before the Market's tanked I was like I'll put more I'll build more crap there and then when the Market's tanked I got cold feet and I was like well let's just sit on it and just see what happens and so now I'm just sitting on it and it's going awesome like it's it's it's booked constantly and so I'm happy with it I don't regret it I would I would do it again um and I but like I learned it was a lot of money to like you know it was seven figures to like get in the game and so I was [ __ ] nervous as hell right it's worked out and I've learned how to do it so now I know more about it so I'm happy happy I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better all right let me go um I got two blue collar hustles for you so these are in the trash in the trash Biz so um I've heard of two trash misses recently that I thought were pretty interesting I wanted to share them with you I want you to tell me which one you like better okay so the first one our buddy Sie Ava told me about this it's called smash my trash have you ever heard of this has he told you about this no but you want to know something funny I've been very close with cieva for like 12 years now and I don't I still don't know how to say his last name [Laughter] yeah I I just he's in my phone book as the very first time I ever met him I just he said he was Russian so he's just saved as cieva Russia and so I just assumed he was Cave of Russia I mean this guy was like in my wedding clothes save a tall handsome smart yeah I just called him Adonis yeah first name and then attributes like visual attributes I remember you buy Six Pack six three got it I have a system and it serves me well um all right so Stephen was telling me about this franchise called smash my trash and so what they do is they basically imagine a giant like Crane and so they drive to any business and like if you've ever been to like we had a warehouse so our warehouse just produces like an um like an ungodly amount of trash just cardboard you don't just burn it just be normal so we have Charlie Charlie burns the trash but like I forgot at that um you would have basically a dumpster and you get charged per like I don't know like per filling of the dumpster like how many times you fill the dumpster and then you call them up and they come and they empty your dumpster what smash my trash does is they'll you sign up for them they drive around they'll come to your dumpster and they just take this giant crane arm and just smash the trash in just compacting it um they let you get way more volume or less it takes less fill so it lowers your trash bill and um you know that could save you hundreds of dollars every month if you do this and so basically the cost of smash my trash should just be less than the savings that they give you from having to do less uh less dumpster fills and so this is like a franchise that kind of crushes it basically you can run this with like two guys and the numbers on this are you invest like I don't know 400k typically they'll make like a million dollars a year in revenue and like 300K of like net income like even a at the end of the day and so you're getting like a kind of amazing cash on cash not not that not that trash returned you were getting on your Airbnb this is some real real returns and um and I think they have I think they have like a [ __ ] ton of locations I think they have like 160 locations or something like that um and so that's like they've made probably 40 50 million dollars in just a franchise fees just uh franchising this concept out so I think this is kind of a like low-key amazing business it's amazing but there's a big downside when was the last time you had a blue collar job do you remember have you ever had one restaurant yeah when I was restaurant not 21 yeah what happens at a restaurant when it closes do you remember just Carnage Carnage everyone goes and gets super screwed up they get drunk you take pills you get hot you just do all types of [ __ ] and then hopefully they show up the next day and there's lots of like I remember I've you know I've I've been a janitor before I've worked in restaurants I've done all this stuff and there was like particularly in restaurants there was constant like issues with this type of person who works there and it sounds classless but it is kind of The Facts of my experience I don't know what do you think the trash I guess if a trash person has a job maybe they get up early so and I when I think of a trash guy I think more of a Family Guy yeah for some reason I trust a trash guy like you know I feel like a trash guy is reliable dependable salt of the earth you know like I feel like it's not the degenerates that you'll get like I would rather hire any Trash guy than a barista at Starbucks right like I feel like the Barista is a flake and we never know what's gonna happen but well the worst is is is like a bartender yeah or a waiter at a fancy like nighttime restaurant like a like a like a or like a like a TGI Fridays like you know what I'm saying like the worst of the worst there's someone out there right now listening to this that is a waiter at TG Fridays it just slam their phone in disgust dude I've worked at all these places I've worked at all these places and like this is probably why I had a little bit of a habit it's I don't know man this is the downside of if you have unlimited access to loaded nachos then something just happens to you yeah yeah like the blooming onion it's like uh it's like it's like the full moon you know what I'm saying like I turned into a werewolf if I get that every night you know like it's it's bad I try to do like a like a Guns and Roses after party like I'm going wild I'm throwing furniture out the window so uh yeah is this cool yes I think there's a lot of headache and I would be curious we have a good friend uh or I'm I think you're friends with them his name's Brian Brian uh scudimore or scuttlemore he owns um sounds like a good friend got junk and Brian has been on the Pod and uh he uh I don't know if maybe I could say this but the company's 100 bootstrapped Revenue this is public Revenue I think is in the 300 to 50 350 million dollar a year range he owns 100 of it he parlayed that now they own like a painting business and they do all these like Services I would be curious what he would have to say is like his trash guys like or his franchisees are like degenerates or not and like what's the headache with those type of people we should definitely ask him I feel like uh I feel like he's gonna give his sign off on this so so this is one trash idea the other one comes from Twitter I gotta give credit to Mobile Home Park guy um I I know the guy behind us he's actually pretty awesome but I don't know if he's trying to be public with his identity here but he's part of our our guy Mafia right we got the the restaurant front guy we got the car dealership guy now we have a mobile home park guy and he goes I just found this trash business that is called bin scrub and what they do is they clean off your trash cans so they wash the power wash your trash cans because everybody's trash cans are filthy he's like he's like here's how I would take this business and turn it into you know six figures a year of profit he goes why do I love this business so everybody's got trash bins so you know your Market is every home um it's a very young industry low Market penetration so you'll probably be the only person offering this service is not like a bunch of competitors yet um you just need one truck and some hustle uh in a post-covered world there's lots of germaphobes and you can play on that and this has like word of mouth virality so you know this has like public virality you can see the actual service being done and so he goes so he goes you've got to buy a truck the trucks are about 40K but it's a hard asset you're going to be able to get a loan against this so you might only have to put down five or ten thousand dollars and get a bank to finance the rest because the truck will do this um he goes now here's how I how is here's how I juice this business to make it more more valuable hey guys we're gonna make it make this like the ice cream truck we're gonna put a speaker system on top and every time we're coming around your neighborhood we're playing the same song He's like you know I'm going with Outcast So Fresh So Clean just like just because it's a pun and he's like we're gonna play this every single time this song is our branding we're gonna drive around from 3 P.M to 8 PM when people are home from school home from work and they can look out the window and be like what is that and then they will they will see us power washing someone in their neighborhood's bins you can even it's like a horrible idea hold on hold on hold on he goes um he goes we're gonna we're gonna like basically leave little flyer brochures on top of everyone's bin so when they take out the trash they're gonna see that you know this trash can is dirty we clean them out we we leave your trash can so clean you could eat cereal from it and he's like that would be my he's like my I put a spoon in it be like you're so clean you could eat cereal out of this um so he's like that's what I would do for my marketing he goes I think one truck can do about 100 to 200 homes a day it's a few thousand dollars a day per truck in Revenue um you'll use that to finance the second truck your costs are gas water maintenance some chemicals assuming you're the one doing the truck and he's basically like this is a blue collar side hustle if somebody wants to themselves get out there and get to that 10K a month of of income uh that they may not be able to get out of their job this is this is his idea so he goes what do you think fella so Sam you said it's a horrible idea tell me why uh okay so completely uneducated here so two doubts uh I don't think that you can do I I don't think that that many people would want this and number two 100 to 200 a day that's so many that is so many I would how much it would take 20 minutes to drive somewhere I don't that math is wild to me yeah you'd basically have to get to a like dense area and then and then do a route but that would kind of assume that they're all your customers which they're not gonna all because your customers at the start did he call us out and say what do we think no but oh you know he listens to the Pod so uh by the way there's two people there's two people in the comments here one um sparkling bins business they make the trucks so there's a woman in the comments goes it's a fantastic business we've been we manufactured the trucks it's been going great since 2020 and then another guy goes um yeah I do this mine's called bin Busters I'm two years in it's going great okay well I mean what the hell do I know and by the way that guy his bio says living the American dream uh good good for him he's this is their dream and they're they're pulling it off uh uh I don't know man I'm out I'm out in this one I don't want to do this it was like start a newsletter yeah start a newsletter dude I uh I I I've people make fun of me because I bring this up so much I had hot dog stands whatever but I used to work with my hands outside it's so hard man it is so you said you were a janitor when were you a janitor uh when I was in eighth grade I worked at a bakery and it was my job to like mop the floors take out the trash clean the dishes and so that was like my first job six dollars an hour and then uh yeah that's what I did dude I am so mad at my parents for never giving me my my my grind story like can I you didn't do anything hardship yeah like yeah you ain't gangster at all I mean an Uncle's store for a month and just just give me that story five dollars an hour and I had to empty the trash like nobody knows how long I did it like I got nothing dude I grew a lot of Asia parents don't want you to do that they say do your home hands got no calluses yeah and my kids I'm gonna give them one hustle story you know they're gonna have some very token small hardship that will sound good later when they make it because you need that story and I I just don't have it a lot of my Indian friends which I have a ton they their parents were like you don't even clean your room just do your homework just study is that what they said to you like like don't cook don't clean just study well they didn't say it like that but I wasn't asking to cook or clean so it just never came up and they were like yeah your your job is to study and do good in school so you can get like a good job don't go be a janitor and I was like dude I did it all man I did the janitor stuff I was a waiter I was a busboy I was a valet driver I did it all man and uh I'm happy I did it but uh I don't want to do it anymore oh and by the way I need to redeem myself I made fun of like the someone the other day said the retail class so this is like the the blue collar class but uh I read this there was this funny article on Business Insider it had the worst but hilarious title and it was I'm a millennial manager who works with Gen Z and then said like Colin with Gen Z workers they have a lot of feelings and so look you're either gonna like somebody you're gonna have drug issues work with one group of people or you're just gonna have to talk forever about like bringing your whole self to work and all that nonsense so like we all have our faults we're all screwed you know what I'm saying I hate when people say bring your whole self to work I'm okay with you just bringing your work self to work that's cool too you don't have to prefer that yeah I prefer that if you want to bring a little bit more of yourself we could talk about that too but like you know it's not a mandatory you don't have to bring your whole self right I'm okay with just your work self so we all every every every class and every generation has issues so I don't mean to throw shade just at one um we throw shade at all here we're at equal opportunity shade thrower yeah Dad Sam is the trash man I'll make fun of myself someone made fun of me the other day because I've got these surgeries on my ear I was talking about my ear and my glasses sit funny I don't know if you notice my glasses sit crooked because like it's my ear and someone said uh it looks like Sam got brain Sam got head surgery didn't pay for him to put the rest of it back in because of his glasses are sick and I was like no that's kind of kind of accurate yeah yeah you're kind of there um dude I told you the other day I want to tell you about a media company that most people have no idea about but they kind of killed it and I love it so I told you the other day about about parcast I tell you about parcast yeah yeah this was the uh podcast Network that was doing True Crime stuff yeah so I learned about the story I think the guy who started just tweeted saying that he was done at Spotify so I guess his or not is up but listen to this so it was a three-year-old uh startup that sold for 50 million dollars to uh Spotify and the way it started was the guy his name was Max Cutler at the time his 27 year old graduate and he bootstrapped this thing his dad worked in radio I don't think his dad was like a rich guy I think his dad uh Ron Cutler I think he was like a uh he was a radio broadcaster so he had industry but I don't think he was like in the business type of thing and he uh they bootstrapped this thing and by 2018 it's only two years in they had 16 shows with a hundred million downloads by 2019 they had 40 weekly shows now they have a staff of something like 150 of which 75 of them are voice actors and I listen to these it's so weird I listen to these every night when I go to bed so like I've got like my favorites I listened to one called serial killers there's another one called deathbed confessions and there's another one called like murder couples which is about Bonnie and Clyde there's another one like it's like all these things and there's and it's not like our podcast at all there's zero riffing and it's like voice actors see we should just make up fake True Crime shows like stabbed but not dead yet the black guy yeah I just just like stories that people just got mind of her was it really an accident yeah spit on by a homeless guy stories of NYC exactly not injured but it was gross yeah barely assault uh you hurt my feelings True Crime Thrills dude and but like this is the reason why I like this is it's not like uh it's like they're just like you know how weird talking about like people who do things beautifully done like you know uh This American Life and it's like thoughtful it's like thoughtful like today on This American Life we're gonna talk about like the opioid crisis and they like go out and interview people this is not that it's just someone who read a book summarized it and then is reading it and they pump out like literally one a day and they have like uh you know 40 shows in that 40 shows now and it's just a volume play and this guy was like dude this true crime [ __ ] to Their audience is 75 women and then me uh and they're they're like Their audience like it's crack it's crack to me I cannot stop listening to this [ __ ] and it's the same thing every single day you know it's kind of like Family Guy you know Family Guy they've been doing it for like 25 years now it's the same [ __ ] all the time it works every time I'm gonna watch it every single time it's just like that it's the same shtick over and over and over again and they were acquired it was they required for something like 53 million or 54 million dollars in cash and then like another 50 million in earn out but pretty fascinating this guy bootstrapped this and they're not popular on social 20 000 followers Twitter 36 on Facebook 50 000 on Instagram they just dominated like people searching for their their one podcast is called serial killers that's all it's called and they just like dominate when people search these so it's like long tail it's like what's the difference what's SEO for podcasts peo I don't know uh and they just crushed it really fascinating business and I brought that up so I did it I hadn't done the proper research I needed to kind of close that Loop you know there's a we had talked about the beautifully done like you know just X but beautifully done there's another version of that that we haven't talked about and uh I don't know I don't know about you but like when I was growing up like if I had like a plate of food and it's like let's say it's I had a bunch of veggies I had a broccoli a brussels sprouts stuff like that I didn't really want it I was kind of like tired of eating it but it's still there and I know I should eat it um me and my sister used to have this thing where if one of us was like in that that spot where we wanted it we know we should do this but oh God just the idea of sitting here for another 20 minutes just spoon after spoon of this that's I just can't bring myself to do it one of us would look at the other and just say Savage just Savage you start to eat just like an absolute animal and you in like 30 seconds you do they say it's like chugging for food and so um we used to say that and it would be like all right we got to Savage it and we would just quickly down the whole thing now there's a version of that for businesses that's kind of what you described here was this guy was like oh okay people like this true crime audience pumping this out I'm gonna Savage it and so basically in two years to pump out 40 shows and get a hundred million downloads there's only one way to describe that he Savaged it and it he wasn't trying to be beautifully done I bet you it's imperfect in all these different ways you know he might have been hiring you know random voice actors and you know Paraguay and like doing whatever it took to get these out there and pump them out but that's exactly what he did and I think actually way more often than the beautifully done do you see people just Savage it and just just scale up like an absolute Savage because they find something that works and then they don't they're not perfectionists and they don't like um they they don't get limited by what's the normal Pace they're like and that works what's the theoretical limit of this and that works more I remember when I lived in San Francisco when I started the hustle I was like originally I was like let's just pump out blog posts and people are like well what about quality over quantity and I was like dude did you bring yourself to work again yeah I was like dude I well I was I would always turn on I go no our quality is quantity right like we are not we are not an article business we are like how many how how can these operations be where we pump out lots of Articles that's the product we're building you're not a journalist you're a blogger go go blog it was like and then another that was always one where like people are always like quality versus quantity and I'm like uh you need both or if I want to play with their heads I'd be like no the quality is the quantity another thing where people would say is like uh well it's a marathon not a Sprint and that was like a a reason for them to slack and I'm like yeah but have you ever ran a marathon at world record Pace it's gonna feel like a Sprint so like you know it feels pretty fast when you're running real like top marathoners we're running fast so it's gonna feel like a Sprint uh but yeah this guy is a quantity over quality guy and I love it yeah I love it exactly okay I think we should uh we should wrap it here that's the pond [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
here's the exact quote he goes do you want the numbers all right in in year one we cleared $110 million in retail sales sorry 250 million in retail sales and 110 million gross [Music] internally all right we're live what's up what's up dude uh have you been following this Prime energy drink thing or prime I don't know what the [ __ ] is it's just an a Gatorade alternative right have you followed it yeah I followed it because a while back I don't know like a month ago uh Ben business partner Ben he uh he told me he met some guy who was like involved with it he's like dude the numbers are insane for Prime like there there's telling you know bleep amount of just this one skew and like let alone the main the main drink and I was like there's no way uh that's a crazy number and then I think recently they came out and said some more numbers what did they say there's two takeaways here the first takeaway is the numbers so Logan Paul said the beverage brand he launched with KSI uh on so on January 4th so about a month or something ago he said it did 250 million in Revenue in the first year and it did 44 million in Revenue in just January of 2023 so recently um and then he also said But then check this out here's the exact quote he goes do you want the numbers all right in in year one we cleared $110 million in retail sales sorry 250 million in retail sales and 110 million gross internally so the takeaway here for me is one that's huge numbers two what the [ __ ] does what what the hell does that mean this guy doesn't even know his numbers yeah that could take away bro you're off by half like uh that's crazy also what the hell does 110 million gross internally what he's saying is they sell Wholesales so uh this because they sell this thing let's say at Walmart so in Walmart it did 250 million in sales but to them they're they're bought at wholesale prices so they the markup is you know what what's you know they basically sell at Half Price Right so they sell it to Walmart they sold 110 Million worth to Walmart so their company sold 110 million the total product sold 250 million is what I think that has to mean well crazy crazy that this is that big I've actually seen a few interviews with Logan and uh he says what the numbers are and then someone from behind the scenes goes no no no it was this and he goes wait what oh my bad it was this and it's pretty wild that like I think Logan's a smart guy I would love to have him on the Pod and everything but it's pretty wild how he's really just focus on the content thing and probably doesn't know much about the business thing it's pretty interesting I've seen him like ask Mr Wonderful or something about that about like different stocks and things like that and he's pretty has a pretty rudimentary understanding of like certain Finance topics that I thought for sure he would be somewhat on top of but I guess not you can crush it without knowing that well uh I don't know about that like I think he I think he's like anything else like the way we are probably good at business but and we're just enough to be dangerous at at the kind of like content you know like you know like when we see a YouTuber both of us have had this reaction where we're like oh we're horse carriage operators and a Tesla just drove by like this is when I see somebody on Tik Tok you know you might as well be you know it might as well be at Hogwarts with a magic one I'm like doing I don't know how to do those things and I will never know and like it's awes but I I just can't imagine myself really doing those things at the level you can do them and so I think he's good enough to be dangerous on the business side and smart enough obviously to know what categories to go into and what who to partner with so like if you look at their moves right like just zoom out so that you can't you know um you know hear what he's saying or or whatever you look at their moves the transition from Vine to YouTube great jump the transition from YouTube cancelled to YouTube like you know rejuvenated that's a good good move there then from YouTube to boxing celebrity boxing he ended up boxing Floyd Mayweather for he did all right he did all right yeah like and his brother's you know doing he's one of the most you know High earning um you know boxers out there he's like not a boxer yeah so that that's incredible um then the next jump you know for Logan was WWE so now Logan is one of the big stars in WWE but he does it on his terms he then transitioned his YouTube content into podcast content cuz he's like you know I'm maturing by the way have you seen him in WWE he's good he's really good exactly like if I was 13 I pretty sure I would think Logan Paul is the [ __ ] [ __ ] cuz I'm 34 and I think Logan Paul is the [ __ ] [ __ ] you know like he's good like he he's got the acting down he's got the uh he looks ripped he's good and people love to hate on these guys um for you know good re sometimes good reasons they've done some things that are like you know whatever he did the stupid video um in Japan he uh gets he's got in some trouble for his like nft thing but like I don't know I I think there's a lot to be to to learn from and admire in these guys I'm not saying they're great people or perfect people I don't know them personally I can't say either way on that but I think from a marketing perspective yeah they crush it 15 out of 10 right like from a brand building from a a sort of learning how to keep riding new waves and stay relevant um these I mean these are they're phenomenal the same way that the Kardashians are phenomenal in some way and you could disparage them for a bunch of reasons or you could look at the things they do great and say cool I'm just going to take inspiration from the things they do great rather than hate on them in a very common way about you know the same stuff everybody else does um so yeah I think you know what he's done here is is pretty phenomenal I I think they're kind of him and KSI are kind of like um minor Partners business think I think it's like a like a like a third a third a third type of thing The Operators get a third here yeah I mean I I saw an interview and it was either a third or like a 20% but uh yeah minority but meaningful I mean it this this can be a billion dollar brand dude I invited him to Camp MFM by the way and I was like yo you should come it's going to be awesome and he was like uh he's like dude I can't get hurt he's like I'm doing the WWE if I go play basketball I'm going to get hurt why did he reply to you I can't like sprain an ankle or twist a knee and like not be able to go wrestle at WrestleMania in a month what what platform did you speak to him on you know actually what happened was uh what had happened was that's whated was I jumped into Twitter spaces where he was there and I just started talking there um and then he dm' me afterwards and then um I was like hey uh you know you actually he had talked about my Clubhouse or metaverse tweet on his podcast too um and I was like yo you actually talked about my other thing you know that I'm that guy and he was like oh cool um and so you know Twitter DM is kind of where we talked dude that's actually kind of a a hack there's like a handful of YouTubers that have five 10 20 million subscribers who I've chatted with on Twitter and they only have like 10 or 100,000 followers on Twitter and their fans children aren't using Twitter and it's such a good way to like get in front of them and uh i' I've actually pulled that move a few times on Twitter it's pretty pretty uh I'm shocked it works that's genius it's just not the same without thousands of roaring fans chanting our name signing you know people's backs and [ __ ] like that hairy backs uh sweaty backs you want to do a recap so basically the gist of this is is Sean and I did a somewhat impromptu it was supposed to be a Meetup uh turned into like a live performance basically in Vancouver I don't know how many people were there between a, or 1300 is but we sold out this theater in Vancouver it went pretty great uh you want to talk about a few things that surprised you yeah let's uh let's do that okay surpris um surprisingly hard to be on stage even though we kind of at this point talk for a living um there was a moment about an hour before where we're both like like how do you use your tongue do you touch it against your teeth when you're making sounds what do you do with that um and we just had no idea what to say why do it was like you know that moment of panic where it's like are these people even coming for us who are they is this did did they sell the tickets or did people just click maybe like you know we just questioned everything for a moment what are we going to say up front how do we make this amazing for people and U there was really no thought that went into this like one hour we went and got Sushi ahead of time and we were like so what do you want to talk about we talked about that for five minutes and then we started talking to each other about family and just fun stuff but yeah we had like a a 10-minute powwow to try to figure it out but I think it turned out okay either I think the content turned out we we basically we're pretty tough critics of ourselves I think we gave the overall event an eight out of 10 and I think the I think it was not it was not a 10 because I think it was a little poorly structured like the opening part was a lot of intro Welcome to our spon thank our sponsors that sort of thing and also we weren't as well prepared as we could have been in terms of like we could have come up with things that that play better live than um than on stage like I had the Moment of clarity afterwards I was like oh it's a show that's live with the audience we should be doing things like ab and C um and we didn't fully get that but we did like a little shark tank pitch competition we did Q&A we did some stuff with the crowd so I think that was good all things considered I thought it was actually a nine I think like given the amount of preparation and the amount of fun people had uh another shocking thing was people came I think the value in order was to see us to meet one another than to actually hear what we had to say yeah right right exactly and I think there's some benefit in doing it in Vancouver where there's probably just not a lot of events going on for entrepreneurs OR tech people that are like exciting uh versus I think if we had done this in San Francisco we probably would have got more numbers but they wouldn't have cared as much like there was a lot of people at this thing in Vancouver that traveled from Toronto or from Portland OR from different places to come see it because oh might as well it's a couple hours away and uh you know you know there's not going to be another thing like this anytime soon where I'm at um so anyways those were some quick uh quick Recaps I guess if people weren't there what should we explain what did we actually do so it was me you and Andrew Wilkinson on stage it was in this theater so there's like a balcony seating there was like a you know basic a giant theater where like a comedian would normally play in fact backstage as we're walking up it was truly humbling and I mean humbling in the in the most [ __ ] on myself way which was we're walking up to the stage and it's like these framed pictures of guys who were in that St same green green room before us it's like Jerry Seinfeld Dave Chappelle it's like all these like legendary comedians it's like some of the best podcasters that you've ever seen in the entrepreneurship category on Apple podcast dude it was it was humbling another thing that was humbling was after it happened we left the stage and we went and just hung out with people and there was just a huge line and what it made me realize was that so a lot of people don't realize this but it's basically Sean and me and and producer Ben um Jonathan sometimes and we are sitting here just recording talking to each other you forget all we forget on a regular basis that it's being recorded when the podcast gets published we don't see comments we don't know like we could see the numbers but it's just like an analytic screen I don't know who's listening why they're listening I don't know any of that and so you forget that this stuff actually kind of matters to some people and it's really fun to go and meet meet people who consume your thing and realize wow this actually matters to them that was humbling as well and that yeah there would be like a father and son be like we always listen to the Pod together and then we brainstorm he's 14 but he wants to be an entrepreneur like you guys so after we listen to the Pod we then brainstorm and do stuff it's like oh that's really cool this is like a this like embedded in your kind of like family a little bit you know there were examples like that that were very surprising to me but but cool also I should say you were good at that like you were really good on stage Sam I don't know what happened I think the nicotine pouch kicked in and Sam went to another level I'm going to start doing nicotine dude that was a great ad for for that uh Sam had great jokes and then afterwards also I feel like in the meet and greet you were good at being kind of the celebrity like I didn't know what to do with my hands you know people would come up be like can I take a picture and my response was like why oh yeah sure I guess and then they would stand next to me and I would do this like Point thing to each one of them like this guy like if you look go look on the Instagram every picture with me I'm just doing nah it's about this guy right here whoever the fan was and you were giving him the billionaire hug which um I don't know if people picked up on but you you you taught me this afterwards I didn't know this trick explain the billionaire hug so I have a theory that once you hit a billion dollars you get like invited to this like seminar and they teach you how to do a billy hug which is basically when you hug someone your hips and ass are in One Direction but then your shoulders an arm lean hard to the right and so you could be touching them shoulder toh shoulder but ass to ass you're never touching them and this is like a way to like look we're touching and I'm being affectionate but like my crotch isn't in the vicinity therefore it's safe it's all good this is PC and so I do the billionaire hug I also bring my wife along to all these things as well because it always freaks me out I'm like I don't know man I don't want ever I don't want anyone to get the wrong idea sometimes you know it's just it's just it could be comfortable every once in a while so I did the Billy hug I do the I'm not a billy but I did the Billy hug because I've learned from billies is it a is it a sexual thing is it like you know you're you're keeping your wallet away from them what what are you doing what why does the why do the hips need to be away is there even an explanation or it's just something that only billionaires would understand it's just a a time honored tradition I don't know I'm not there yet so I don't know but I just I you know it's like singing in the shower I copy my heroes uh so that that's why I do it um and this is a man and a woman thing by the way it's from the as well I've noticed that sometimes we have this relationship with people where they hear us talk and they think oh you're so approachable and sometimes they'll come up to me and they go dude let's [ __ ] let's do this and I'm like whoa you're coming on too hard to me I know I say this stuff but you're coming on too hard so sometimes you need to set some boundaries and that's my mini boundary it's the Crouch boundary right uh we we so we had our buddy Andrew on there Andrew was really funny too I I got to say Andrew who's been on the pot a bunch of times I never met in person so I've talked to him on the phone we've done Zoom calls he's come on the Pod but in person I got to say he's got a lot more juice than I expected and dude tell the story about dinner or lunch so we go so we go to lunch so before the show we're like oh dude we got to hang out Ben you're he's kind of from this area I thought Vancouver BC is all the same thing actually you got to take a sea plane yeah of or a helicopter so he took a [ __ ] Chopper to come meet us which is honestly one of the more big dog moves anyone's ever done to me um well the reason we knew it was a big dog move because he was a he was like five or 10 minutes late and instead of saying uh you know my flight was delayed he said I was late for my flight and I was like wait what yeah that's subtle I didn't pick that up I just heard over when he called on the phone it was just I just heard the chopper going and I was like hey wait a minute is there a fan on near you what's going what is that um so he lands and before he lands he goes I'm going to be 5 to 10 minutes late again I was late for my flight and then he goes um just order meist just order to me and Sammy goes eight oysters two two salmon niri this like you know whatever wagu steak um you know a miso soup I have a nut and shellfish allergy I'll die if somebody does that and then he he just signs it off thanks but just THX and I see this I I was I was running late too as as per usual I was in the shower at this point I just started laughing Sam replies what did you say I was like did you just say thanks to me like yes sir I mean it was like ridiculous and he was like sorry he tried he tried to blame an autocorrect we're like Noah bro you're just used to talking to people too much like that you you you have people who let you get away with that that [ __ ] might fly in Canada but you don't bring that weak THX [ __ ] to to the United States of America we we we reject that we send that back um we go to lunch and we're having a good time we're just catching up again Andrew's got the juice he's got the juice in the way that my best friends who I look up to the most have that juice you have that too when you hang out in person with Sam he's got a little bounce in his step and it just seems like he's eager he's excited he's got a plan wherever you go there's not going to be it's not going to just be a default normal experience something a little more fun is going to happen something a little extra is going to happen a little more laughter a little more um you know learning something extra is going to happen so Andrew had that which I was a which was awesome to see cuz he's quite I don't know would you say like reserved or calm he's got almost like a calm brand but in person his energy was a lot more kinetic freeing and I liked it he had a very kinetic energy where he was physical you know he was moving he was that's a great way of putting it yeah he was kinetic he had that I have that too people always yell at me cuz I've got big thighs and I shake and when I ever I shake my thighs the table moves and they're like dude you're too kinetic so yeah he's got that kinetic energy and we're having this wonderful lunch it's probably an hour and a half in and then we're not quite done eating yet or at least it doesn't feel there and then all of a sudden he goes oh shoot and we're like What like he like it's like a panic he goes dude my Uber's been outside waiting for me for 10 minutes I got to go bye and he just stands up and walks away and we're like he was even better than that he just stood up like he was stretching for a second and then he picked up his jacket and he's like I'll see you guys at the place we're like what and he goes yeah S I got to go my Uber's been outside for 10 minutes like when did you call an Uber and he floated away like a balloon like he was the grandfather and up and he just went away the house flew away and then me and Sam were like okay yo was that weird that he just kind of floated away like a balloon yeah it's like well we'll work on conversation skills later Andrew have a nice day yeah he just kind of bounced um yeah I had to blow him a kiss he was running away so so far it was the only appropriate goodbye but in general the thing was awesome now I I don't I'm not going to put you on the spot but I would like us to do a five or three like thing where like a day thing where we could do like you know three dates in five days I want to go to like C and B cities so not the New Yorks not the SFS something like uh Denver or Toronto or Kansas City something where there're you know what what did you call it small pit small pond syndrome that's what I want to be I want to be a a big fish in a small pond because these people were big piss in a small pond that's a hard word to say but you want to do it do you um uh you have a little something on your shirt here I think you got a little taste of Fame a little dribble of that Fame that just stained the shirt there you you liked that taste of Fame didn't you well here's why I like it we've talked about this we know why you like it yeah cuz being famous is awesome it is awesome but it is exhausting now I understand why like the touring bands who last a long time they show up they do the concert and they go home and go to bed I was like I couldn't sleep cuz we like did we hung out with everyone then we had like a breakfast the next day but anyway I liked it because it was a challenge I also think that in our little Tech world we assume that we're this little niche internet nerds which we are but it's actually cool to like Flex and see the people and and honestly felt like a movement and there was times where I I felt it was you and I were great at what we do but in reality we were just an excuse and like a steward of like a particular type of movement of these people who are like you know we're all on a journey some people are further ahead some people are uh not there yet some people don't want to go far some do but they're all going someplace and it felt like we were just an ex uh an excuse to gather those people and it really felt Beyond and bigger than us I know that sounds woo woo and [ __ ] like that but that's truly how it felt and so that's why I thought it was cool I agree 100% At first I felt so excited I was like man I can't believe we sold out this theater there's 2,000 people on the wait list they came to see us and I think there was a a small part that was like that's like the stated excuse but the reality is that the value was just if you like this podcast that's put you through a bunch of filters and filters are like a lot of our of our sayings right so it's like you know no small boy stuff right so it's like people who want to think big for themselves but they Define what big means for them but it's also people who don't take themselves too seriously if you want the smartest podcast you should go listen to invest like the best and go listen to all in and go listen to a bunch of podcasts with people who are their intellectual horsepower out runs ours right the oven Burns a little hotter for those guys than it does for us um if you want somebody who like we will celebrate a dude who's like a plumber that's hacking the Yellow Pages to get more leads as much as we will a guy who's building a new a new city or a new country you know from scratch and so there there's like this set of people who appreciate the same things we appreciate and when you put them together we're pro like it's not easy for them I think in their day-to-day life to be around a bunch of other people who are like them the sort of schemer and dreamer um you know uh Prof or archetype and so that's what I saw was the best cuz I was like oh man sorry you guys had to wait they're like no it was awesome I was in line with a bunch of other people who were I met this guy who's doing this and this guy's doing this and I said oh wow okay that makes sense to me like the real value here wasn't coming and getting a selfie with me as I do my awkward point it was actually just getting to like to be in a community of other people who have that who have the same sort of freak energy that you have and um then once that once I saw that I was like okay this makes sense we should do you know more dude I met a guy like there was a couple billionaires in the crowd I don't know if you know that and I'm not going to call them out but I I met one of them um or at least they're their Stak and they they own multiple they they have large stakes in multi-billion dollar companies and I remember I met one of them and he was like a typical like dorky guy and then I met this other guy who had a sheetrock business that like you know it's like a blue collar thing and his hands were just so meaty and fat and I remember shaking his hands and I told him I was like dude I can't even WRA my hand around your hand and I'm not small and uh that's and I was like dude that's sick we got we got the neck beards and the callous hands guys and uh and this guy one of the guys I go yeah just you know DM me on Twitter he goes okay cool you'll see me my Twitter handle is called [ __ ] manly and uh that's what he said to me and I was like all right that's badass give us a hat yeah he he's uh he said something he's like my wife has a big Instagram following for women stuff so I decided to create [ __ ] manly to like counteract that I thought that was awesome um I want to tell you about one woman who I thought thought uh was really had a really interesting story came out I know her well so I was at the there was a dinner the night before that the tiny guys hosted and at the dinner met some people whatever was good uh one woman came up and she goes um she's like hey my name's uh Anya you know uh big fan blah blah blah and then she gave me a little like quick high five she goes I just made my first million and I was like nice uh what do you do and um and she was like well you know we I created this app for people with panic attacks it's called rooted and I was like panic attacks is that like an app for panic attack I never would have even thought about that Niche and uh she's like yeah you know I struggled with it like crazy um and so then I created this app so she pulls out this app called rooted and rooted as in like you know feeling grounded instead of having you know this sort of panic attack and there's like a red panic button you can hit if you're feeling something in the moment but there's also just like sleep there's like lessons where you can learn about like what is this thing and why does this happen to me like drills and breathing exercises exerc breathing exercise so on and so forth and she said she has had 2 something million downloads of this app and I thought okay that's pretty great um that's that's not even the crazy part then I was like wow um are you are you just really good at Facebook ads or what she goes no I don't do any paid marketing yeah and I was like so how do you get 2 point something million downloads of this she goes well um I think you know it solved a real problem and also I dominate like the App Store search for this cuz everybody else went really broad they tried to go for like sleep or anxiety or breathing and I went for panic attack because everybody else thought that was too narrow and I just really like did a good job owning that in the App Store ASO right instead of SEO the the App Store optimization and then I started getting good reviews and it just snowballed and now I'm like the top one in that and I thought did she tell you how big of the team was exactly so I was like um I was like she's already halfway to being my hero at this point and I go and this is her first business this is her first bus I go seal the deal from me uh how big's your team she goes it's just me yeah crazy right I go what and she goes yeah it's just me I have a couple contractors that you know help me with things but there's no employees I don't want any employees um and I was like I want to be you you're you know you're she's building something that has an impact um you know she dominated it her way when anybody else would have like if she went to go ask you know smart guys like us or go ask some Mentor what should I do they'd either say you know go ask an investor they'll say it's too small of a market go ask a mentor they'll say well you need to you know what's your growth strategy and she's like I don't know I just want to build a useful product and like I'll figure it out as I go third is like you need to scale up you're no way because she she's closing these deals now with like healthcare companies where they'll just provide it for like you know all of the members of their gold plan so like they'll pay for it for 50,000 members or something like that now and you know do you need a a BD rep and a sales team and all the stuff she's like no I just go take the meeting myself and it took some time but we we got the deal done she said she meets them on LinkedIn she goes I just messaged him on LinkedIn fantastic so I thought uh Anya you know shout out to her she's the she's got the I don't know not Billy of the week not blue color side hustle she's something else but like you know the riches and niches Award of the week um you know goes to her cuz I thought that was a pretty amazing story no it was amazing and this is her first business and so like you know everything that she said or everything that she has done if you told me like if she told me the idea which is uh I'm going to I've never done anything Tech related before and I can't code I'm going to hire contractors overseas to do this I don't know anything about marketing I'm like oh you're everything you're saying you're going to lose this won't work right and she completely has pulled it off and if you if you go to the reviews did you look up her app I mean it's legit like there's like uh I think it's like a 4.9 rating it's like a really high rating thousands of reviews and she completely has pulled it off I'm almost positive it's only 2ish years old like it's not it's not it's not uh and then she also just went full-time as of recently so this was like a she just started monetizing it's like most of the app is free she's like yeah I want most of the app to be free um you know because obviously I'm trying to help as many people as I can I'm trying to find that balance uh where it's a sustainable business but also most of the apps free and uh I just thought that was a bad badass story there was a bunch of people there that had like really big stories but to me that was uh a really I just say incredible incredible win and she had a kind of a an intensity about her that you could almost tell when you were talking to her like okay even though on paper you got no attributes right and we all know the rule you got to have some attributes if you want to win she didn't have the experience she didn't have the skill of of certain things but she did have a certain level of intensity and you could see that uh just in talking to her like just the way she came across she came across like a person to be taken seriously and like she was like a like a very small person it wasn't like her stature was she didn't have a natural Knack at that it was just the way she was talking that that that stood out to me did you uh did you meet the vessie guys so V SSI yeah we' went out for lunch so um I I don't know if I can say what what they do I don't maybe you could say but Bas if they told you the numbers I'm not going to say any numbers but uh Tony was the the guy who there is the founder and they make awesome shoes apparently I I haven't tried them so I can't say but they're hardcore in Vancouver and so I um my the lady at my hotel saw me uh wearing them and she goes oh you're wearing vessis those are those are happening so basically this she didn't say they're happening cuz she's not 60 years old uh but you know she said they're cool those are Jazzy fresh uh but anyway so it's this shoe called vessie they look just like tennis shoes but apparently they're like waterproof which is a big deal in Vancouver because it rains a lot and it's wet and the guy bootstrapped the bootstrapped the company and he told me the Topline Revenue which I don't know if we can say it or not just say it and we'll bleep it uh okay fine we'll say say it and bleep it but over um and so basically you you guys didn't hear what I just said but we're talking like not we're talking in the same ballpark of like an all birds or something like that like a a publicly traded company uh quite huge completely bootstrapped and I started talking to him and he's like hey um I I want us like I'm thinking about like getting popular on Twitter and then he started talking to me and I started giving feedback and then he told me about the company and I and he told me the size and I'm like wait wait wait why do you want to be on Twitter you realize this is totally not worth your time and you are like way better than any of the thread boys including me don't go on Twitter dude just keep crushing it and the company that he had was entirely bootstrapped and it started as a Kickstarter so he was like I was like why are you guys so good he said negative cash flow uh negative cash cycle which means um you know people sell the stuff before they have to pay for the goods yeah he's like we just have good terms with a with a manufacturer and we started as a Kickstarter so it's been profitable since day one and and this is another thing where it breaks all types of uh patterns that I thought possible so starting in Vancouver Vancouver is not a big city I think the metropolitan area is like 800,000 or sorry the metropolitan area is 2 million the city is only 800,000 so it's not like an epicenter D I went for a run and I like ran across the city and I don't run so it's not that big yeah and it's like not that big of a city it's in Canada which I didn't realize how like Canada's kind of ponk like it's it's a it's like it's like it's like there's only like 30 million people in that whole place it's like yeah Canada has the same population as California it's crazy in the same population as like the Metropolitan New York area I mean it's but the size of but it's bigger than United States in terms of like the actual land mass so it's like just it's a lot of empty space or a lot of space per person yeah like it's not that big and uh it's a little behind in terms of like it's not like a a sophisticated place which isn't isn't bad but like I remember I went to the airport and they checked my passport in such an odd location and like I remember they checked it like as I was going to the security thing to like scan my my body not ahead of time I'm like oh you guys know it would be way faster if you do this this uh whatever uh and so anyway I met this guy and his company kills it and so he uh huge company in Vancouver dominated Vancouver they love the shoes there everyone was talking about it incredibly quiet and nice no like Thrills they opened up they opened up a a physical store in Vancouver you see you saw the video of that yeah the video of the line there's like a line like and I was like yeah you like this this like a marketing stunt you like paid people to stand in this line he's like no these are like actual customers no he's like it's Monday bleep this too but he said they're going to do out of their retail location this year I was like what the hell that's an absurd number it's crazy this guy was really really cool uh so I'm happy I got to meet him um but anyway good weekend we had a good time we'll do it again our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are Cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best hub spot grow better you want to talk about uh you have another topic or you want me to go uh I got one and then uh but Let's do let's do okay let's do this one first so we went International we went um abroad some might say some might say offshore you know they'd be wrong but but you could say offshore it got me thinking about off aore companies offshoring money and like I don't know about you but I've always heard about this but if you had ever asked me to explain yeah wait how do companies like offshore what is what's a tax Haven like how do these things work do you actually know how this [ __ ] Works cuz no I went down a random Rabbit Hole last night and pretty interesting stuff dude I have no idea what the word tax know really how this actually works I don't know what it means but I like using it you know what I'm saying like I I don't know I don't really want one yeah yeah yeah yeah like it's it's right under uh Shell Shell Corporation when talk about well actually they're related all right so so the here's the kind of the headline or the takeaway which is that companies like Nike Apple huge companies right the companies that we've all heard of use this this is not just like oh I don't know Shady crypto guys that are opening up a company in the Bahamas or whatever it's like you know the the most Blue Chip of Blue Chip companies Apple at one point had like $300 billion dollar offshore overseas that they weren't bringing back into America why because the the here's the general like first principles explanation so you uh every country has a tax rate so let's say in in the United States the corporate tax rate let's say is 21% well if you make money here you're going to pay 21% on all your profits but if you're able to shift those profits so that they're taken in another country you can use that country's tax rate well guess what there are several countries that have a tax rate of pretty much zero and so what these companies do is like I'll give you an example of Nike so Nike did this brilliant thing that resulted in Nike paying like I don't know something like 3% a year tax rate on billions and billions of dollars of uh of Revenue and profits and so how did they do this well what they did initially was they created a a shell company there we go Bingo a shell company in Bermuda and the shell company in Bermuda owned the swoosh like the trademark to the Nike check and then what happened is company in the United States is selling shoes but then and it might rack up let's say 10 billion of Revenue uh or even like gross gross profit so like you know after taking out into account the shoes and the shipping and all that well normally they just have to pay the tax on the 10 billion well what they would do is the swoosh company in Bermuda would then charge them 9 billion let's say um in royalty payment saying hey you're using the swoosh you got to pay us for that so all of a sudden the taxable income in the US goes from 10 down to one and now they just pay the 20 % on the 1 billion and the 9 billion that the Bermuda company got pays a tax rate of zero right so their effective tax rate goes way way down and so this is what they did initially and then um and and this lasted for like you know some period of time um but then and then they kind of closed these loopholes over time so Nike had this had this setup in in the Netherlands and they had this set up in the Netherlands where uh they had you know some Nike international company over there they were doing this where in the NE land they didn't have to pay taxes on on the money for some period of time because there was like a rule where on royalty income you don't have to pay taxes so they're like great all the revenue this company's making is the royalty income from the IP the the the swoosh trademark that were were um that were trademark uh were were renting out basically to our other companies and so they were not paying any taxes on EUR Middle East whatever and then what happens is um you know after 10 years people start complaining they close that loophole the politicians hi five they're like we did it these big corporations are going to pay their fair share and Nike goes oh hold on let me uh they get the Blackberry out they call they call up the lawyer they say hey uh one hole closed open up another please hang up the phone and that the lawyers get to work and they realize we could do something different here's what we'll do we'll create two Dutch companies and one of them will have a director in the United States because here's what happens in the United States the law says if your company if the company is incorporated somewhere else it should be taxed in that country and then in the Netherlands it says well if it has us directors it's going to be taxed in the US so it's kind of like those like goofy those movies where like the two guys are pointing he's got it no he's got it wait what nobody's been taxing this thing and so they they had what was called a stateless company a company that was taxed nowhere which is called Nike inovate CV and uh it paid zero taxes basically and so companies like Nike have been able to do this um Apple does the same thing Facebook does the same thing I don't know if you ever seen like why all these tech companies have offices in Ireland yeah in Dublin everyone has a Dublin a Dublin I was like wow you know okay must is it the great is it the the the Fantastic world-renowned engineering Talent of Dublin what what is the re reason for this and the reason is because there was something called the double Irish strategy which said if you have one one Irish company that own the IP and then another one that was uh you know just like a subsidiary of it and then that one had us director same thing zero Taxation and so for for 5 years I think Apple made $3 billion through their Irish companies and paid zero taxes on it and I just think this is how they do this stuff and by the way Tim Cook goes and he s he stands in front of Congress this's this amazing clip where he goes apple pays every dollar that they owe in taxes um we don't depend on tax GMS we don't stash money in some Caribbean island it's like yeah you stash it in in Ireland instead like what what are you talking about here um and then like you know they they've kind of shut that double Irish strategy down and then the uh and then Apple goes and this is all this all got leaked from this thing that you probably remember called do you remember like the Panama papers when that got leaked do you know what actually happened there uh a bunch of they Panama was a city or a country sorry a country where this happened and I don't know how it got leaked I think the accounting firm that did a lot of the work for people got hacked exactly the fourth Law Firm was something called mosac fona and basically this is the fourth biggest Law Firm they're known for like creating shell companies and all this stuff they got hacked or so not hacked actually somebody just leaked 11 million documents oh my god um they don't know who leaked it but somebody was like a whistleblower leaked this thing and there was like this this team of journalists that looked at it for a year before finally going forward and P publishing the Panama papers well after that there was something called and that's where like the sort of Epstein and Putin stuff came out of the the Panama papers then there was the paradise papers which came after that and that was leaked from this accounting firm called applebe and um you know interesting name you're familiar you're you're a client of theirs yeah is there a is there like a Hooters LLC that can handle my income tax like what yeah these guys do shell companies and soft shells tacos SK we like all types of shells shell macaroni and shell company exactly so so you know they they basically they got leaked too and then that's when the the company stuff that came out uh came out as far as and then you could see Apple going to their Law Firm they they leaked the emails saying um we we've you know the the Irish thing coming to an end we'd like to find another country that has this favorable Advantage can you find us something in the you know maybe in the Caribbean like pretty much the exact opposite thing as he said in front of uh Congress you did something that I think is funny and um so basically when people discuss these topics they use all type of all types of words that in itself are not like by definition are not bad words and they actually don't mean bad things but they use it in this context and people automatically think villain and sometimes I find myself using those words on purpose but like bragging about them so for example loophole uh you use the word loophole why don't we just call it a rule you know like we're just following the rule this is the rule we're going to we're going to use the rule they use loophole loopholes aren't bad just the rule another one manipulate why don't we just use like persuade or influence and so like people use that word manipulate all the time another one is exploit I love that word exploit I'm like oh so to efficiently use something like people talk about Amazon is exploiting their workers I'm like what does that mean isn't that the point is we give you money and then we exploit you like we by myself don't get canceled don't get canceled Sam we just got famous bro don't don't don't ruin this well they use these words and I'm like that word like that's the that's the point is to exploit we're going to use this in a very particular way and we're going to use it efficiently and you you just did that where you use these words but it's like you're saying the word loophole as if it's a scam where it's like no loophole is the opposite of a scam it's right this is we are playing in the rules uh well I think that they do mean something which is that they're within the rules but not the they're within the letter of the law but not the spirit of the law and I think that's the the that's the difference don't get all pro bono lawyer on me bro there's Bro Science now you're doing bro legal jargon by the way Tim Cook actually even said that too in that same clip he goes we not only comply with the letter of the law but a spirit of the law too which was you know that's a lie um but yeah I think you're right which is there are rules of the game and you can if you play by those rules you should not blame the player you should hate the rulemaker right you should hate the game um and so I think that that's that's where a lot of people go wrong right they hear this stuff when I'm explaining these I'm not saying apple and Nike are evil but when I explain I'm I'm really what I'm saying is I never really knew what this meant I never knew actually how it worked dude you're a capital you're a capital J journalist you're just saying the facts I'm a capital man I think we established that myself um so so yeah I think this is kind of interesting and then it's like what's the game theory so one thing that Trump did which is actually pretty smart which is another load thing you can't say um was he was like dude these companies have like hundreds of billions of dollars overseas cuz what happens is once they get taxed in the low low low tax place they can't just move the money back into their you know Chase Bank here in America and like you know go go down to the ATM and pull it out like it would get taxed when it comes back so they leave it overseas um so that's just money that never reaches and so what Trump did was he goes all right look I'm going to make a one-time exception for you to What's called repatriate the cash bring the cash back to America I'll lower the tax rate it's like kind of like all right guys get in here kind of like you know the store owner like opens the back doors like get in it's like five minutes it's like a gun give back you ever seen those where you can like no questions asked just give us your guns and right right exactly and I think there's some some value to those those scenarios um and so he made it like you know it's 15% tax on that cash this like one time one time only if you want the cash back in America so you can invest it here and use it in your corporate activities here you know here's your your sort of like discount half price um come on in and uh and that brought like I don't know 60 or 90 billion back in but but not like the full amount he thought four trillion would come back in and it they just didn't speaking of uh crazy people and huge men in terms of size and and loopholes and tax evasion I've got a cool story for you and I have a feeling you know about this person this is this is the I don't know if he's a billy but he's he's was close enough have you heard of kim.com you you know who this guy is yeah yeah he's he's prolific as you like to say dude this guy that's the phrase here I was going to say this guy's a prolific freak he's a total freak so this guy named kim.com has all these interesting facts and I read about him because he he's like 67 350 pounds this guy's massive he's huge and he lives in New Zealand and he uh him and his wife he married like a Philippine like beauty queen or something like that and she divorced him and and these people thought that they were going to like she was going to talk [ __ ] about him she's like no no no like I have nothing bad to say about him it just it the marriage didn't work out but he was a nice guy uh and so I started reading about him by the way what's his real name uh so Kim schmidtz but then he was known as Kim Tim Jim Vester or Kimble and then eventually he legally changed his name to uh so the wife the ex white kept her married last name and her name is like you know like sarah.com and so like the article refers to her as like miss.com uh it's like so that's her legal name so this guy's like uh I'm gonna become Sean worldwide Mr worldwide this is my wife Mrs worldwide nice to meet you dude that the article referred to her as as miss.com and so check this out so this guy in the 90s he starts in Germany as a hacker and he hacks something like 40 million or he claims this but this is not verified he said he uh hacked into some like famous bank and he took $40 million and he donated it to Green Piece At least that's what he said but TBD if that's actually true because Green Piece is like no that's not true and then eventually he starts building all these other programs and all this like software that is like mildly successful and he tries to send and he's a hacker all while while he's doing this doing a bunch of illegal [ __ ] but while doing this he's trying to send a file to his friend and the email that he's trying to send it through says all right you've exceeded the limit we can't do this so he creates this thing called mega upload which eventually like gets huge have you heard of Mega upload if you ever download an illegal movie or anything like that you've probably come across Mega up upload have you of course yeah never never used it for textbooks but uh definitely have used mega upload in my life yeah so mega upload it's kind of like Napster but you don't need to I don't think you uh it's just a website so you don't need to download a client so it's like Pirate Bay I guess is a similar one but again you still don't need a client it's just a website where you can like trade files and it goes viral because all these people would share files and he would put like mega upload like in the uh like image so like that's how it like grew uh and got viral and so anyway he creates this thing and it swells he launches it in 2005 and in 2010 he's basically he's able to pay himself $42 million that was his personal uh income from that and eventually after like eight years he gets sued and Hollywood sues him I guess I don't know what Hollywood is but big Hollywood sues him uh the government sues him sign yeah the sign and they say that he uh made close to $200 million in personal profit from this whole thing and all during this he's doing like this other crazy [ __ ] so out of like 50 million Modern Warfare uh players this guy was ranked number one he was the number one player for Call of Duty yes in 2012 he was the number one person in the world at Call of Duty he also finished first in the Gumball 3000 you know what that is it's like a um car race it's a car race across Europe he finishes first then he releases an album of original music with and he like collabs with other articles uh other artists it's called good times and it's not that bad uh of an album to be honest then he creates the internet party which is a a new political party in New Zealand and it kind of gained some traction and he's doing all of this while running mega upload well mega upload gets sued and he actually goes to jail for the second time he's already been in jail for a few I think a few weeks a few months before for his hacking stuff this time he gets locked up for a longer period of time and when they arrest him they go to his house in his compound and they just swarm it SWAT style and in the house they find all like 40 cars like the nicest cars you know like um these fancy Mercedes amgs um Bugattis all this [ __ ] they find all this art but they also find a175 million in cash this guy had that much money in cash in like a in a room in his his house he's kind of like a proper gangster I mean he's like a gangster of the gangster and to give context mega upload had 50 million visits a day it was like the seventh most popular website in the world at one time it accounted for 4% of the of total traffic in America and it uh had 180 million users and people were transferring 800 files a second on mega upload this thing was huge he had and it was ran almost like a proper company he had 155 employees you know Engineers customer service admin all this stuff and it was wild and this is a wild story that like I just came across cuz I was reading about miss.com his wife or his ex-wife very fascinating guy this guy's super prolific he even created this thing called um a a mega car so he was trying to launch a car company that was like Internet connected and it didn't like work out wonderfully but he built like a handful of the cars but super prolific very interesting um and I thought that you might have a little bit of stories about this guy this guy seems like he runs in your world a little bit I'm going to send you this I can't say this on the Pod but uh We've DMD before and uh I just have to show you what's in this DM we can't this this is not going to be good content but you you have to see this what what what was it just like crazy inapoi stuff I'll send it to you after this but um yeah this guy is prolific I feel like he's kind of like the um Rogue Mark Andre totally like Mark Andre is also surprisingly massive a prolific internet guy who was like you know had like a bunch of ideals and like took took at it Mark andreon just like sort of took more of the straight path and this guy went rogue that's kind of how I think about him um I can't I'm blown away by this Call of Duty thing yeah like he like like this isn't like a he said she said thing I mean that this is like rankings like you can actually see like leaderboards and he was number one yeah but does he just have like a basement of like you know 15-year-old Korean boys that are playing for him or something like do I really believe that this guy was the number one worldwide Call of Duty player that is insane that is so crazy that that's like what's the story about the the Uber guy Travis where he was the number one we tennis player in the world or something like that I think it was like two so basically the story is like Chris saaka this famous investor and Travis were like at Chris saa's like vacation home Chris sacka Mr sacka was there Travis SAA you know that's how we gotta you know that's how we got to explain the story um so you know the difference between the two sacas uh so so kind and polite Mr sacka and Travis are playing we tennis and Travis crushes the dad Mr sacka and Travis at the end of the game goes Mr sacka I've got a confession any kind of like uh you know what's that princess movie with like a I don't think the word means what you think it uh princess diary he kind of like throws the Wii controller into the right hand he goes I've been playing left-handed the whole time but I'm really right-handed and he just like obliterates them even more and he goes I have another confession and he goes to the the the game uh the rankings and he's like two or three in Wii tennis uh and so he's like the lift of Wii tennis 7 out of 10 we'll give him um and so uh yeah this kim.com guy he's crazy man we got I would love to have him on the Pod uh he's uh super interesting yeah that's a crazy story um also he I feel like he did he didn't launch his own crypto token like the odds of him not doing his own token in the last five years like that had to be like a one in one million chance of him not doing it he probably uh I mean he was like indicted by the us but yeah he probably had like I bet you he was like banned for like uh you know selling securities I bet you he had some I didn't look into like uh what his what his ban was and what the what the verdict was but I mean he was in like legit trouble I mean he was in prison uh and so he probably can't um but what's crazy is number one in Call of Duty number two that he had $175 million in cash in a room in his house that's that's wild I don't even know would like to know how much like physical space that takes up but that'd be a lot isn't it like always disappointing it's like that's just two briefcases yeah dude on The Sopranos I was watching last night they gave a guy $75,000 and it was in an envelope like not a like not a like a manila like not even the type that you got to go to FedEx for the type that you have in your home uh I can't tell you how disappointed I would be like if I ever am involved with any kind of Ransom or if I win some sort of prize like I need the Giant check if I win a prize and if you're going to give me some cash like just get it in the smallest bills possible I want duffel bags I want I want like a you know a Costco trolley bringing me the cash like if I get something and it's in an envelope I don't care what's inside I'm throwing it away yeah if it fits in my jacket pocket I'm out and if like and it was like the side pocket of like a suit where you reach in so you know those pockets are small and if in that 75,000 whatever fit in that jacket very keep it just keep it um I bought lottery ticket in Canada I didn't win by the way you buy lottery tickets yeah I I have this moment whenever I get up to the counter where my brain just goes into an instant fantasy of like and then this was the day and then I'm telling people that I almost didn't buy it but I just said hey screw it and I bought it and I won that's the stupidest [ __ ] ever I do that at least one out of three times I'm at a counter in the US they they require cash so that just that's what saves me from not buying it but um in Canada you could buy it on your card it's great we're going to wrap there yeah we could we can wrap there all right that's the Pod we got to start saying the gentleman's agreement every time by the way I keep forgetting to go subscribe to us on YouTube that's it [Music]

what do you uh I'm I'm an investor of yours so you're um I don't forget how much I invested but you're like well I don't really invest in anything other than like van like total index funds and but you're like one of the few I think you're one of three things that I did um it's going great I mean I I see the returns uh but how much do you have in total self storage now like 100 million dollars or something I think last time I came on it was 15 Properties or so and 20 million dollars for the storage and we now have 61 properties uh 1.8 million square feet of storage we've acquired it for a hundred and three million dollars we've raised 41 million dollars from people like you who invested in both storage yeah it's been a whirlwind the last two years have been crazy [Music] would you say 100 million dollars worth of is that that's how much you paid for it I don't know how much it's worth I don't either I mean we could we could guess we could try to guess but look the real estate market has no Mark to market right because like Elon Musk you can see how many shares of Tesla has and the value of those shares I have no idea I mean I can make educated guesses but we sold our portfolio today I don't know uh six months ago we might be able to sell it for 190 million or so oh that'd be awesome we um I think the way I met you was so uh you're you know it's kind of a creepy story years ago I dated this Polish Girl and I remember seeing your picture on Twitter if you're this is so weird your face reminded me of hers are you polish I'm German yeah Huber my my mom is a ghetto finger so yeah we're very German I remember seeing your picture and I was like oh my gosh this guy looks polish almost and then I was driving cross-country and I did a Twitter live or something like that I forget what I did and you like commented and I just called you on air or no I called you on your phone I just put it on speakerphone and we started talking and that and that's how we how we how we met I think right yeah now we know each other quite well I think we've punched each other in the face we've uh guarded each other and fouled each other in basketball we have uh hung out a couple conferences and and we talked several times a week so I appreciate it man I appreciate you too I I that he told me that he was a decathlete and I was like yeah you're not good and then I looked up his times I was like oh he's better than I was uh it's and then that's why I like you even more 400 times I think you ran 47. yeah I opened 47 there's you know splits are crazy because your coach wants to tell you that you run really fast splits to pump you up but he told me I ran a 46-7 one time split I'd believe that my so my fastest opens we're only in the 48 and 49s and my splits were 47 so you're probably a second faster than I was but um and did for those for for the like you went hard on Twitter when we when like covet started so there's like we have this text message group it's me you Sean uh Austin Reef Nikita beer sahil Bloom Greg Eisenberg uh I think that's everyone did I forget yeah you were you were an addition that came on about six months or a year after the group started but yeah it's some good you've added some good uh great banter to it and like but the reason the group started was you guys all went hard on Twitter around the same time and you like each other's stuff your thread boys and then I remember you started doing that but did of that 100 million dollars that you've raised or 80 million dollars that you raised I forget how much how much has come from 40. you've raised 40. yeah on Twitter 90 96 of it has come from Twitter no way is that is that real yeah mine stop my entire real estate private Equity company was built on the back of Twitter yes I had we bought we built our first self storage facility we raised 500 Grand my dad took a mortgage out on our house to do it he didn't tell me that he did at the time because we were middle class and I went around to his friends basically and he helped me raise the money for that first deal everybody says you know you're not self-made and that's mine not self-made stories that my dad was the first investor in my first storage building but um no then we ran out of money and we had to buy our second third fourth and fifth properties with that with our own cash from our store from our stored company our moving company so then you know fast forward to Twitter I'm tweeting about deals I'm tweeting about some of our properties and people are dming me asking to get on our investor list and fast forward to today we've raised 40 million bucks from 320 people and we have 2 000 people on our distribution list and it's changed my entire life what's uh 40 million divided by 300 what's the average check Ben can help us out maybe I don't have a calculator on me but yeah 50 Grand people start we have some investors up over a million bucks that's crazy I wish I would have done a million dollars when I saw like the checks out yeah that deal that you're in is going to be a really good deal we refinanced it in a really crappy refined environment but we're going to build some climate control storage on that property and that was a deal that was really big and was uncomfortable man I mean we bought a nine dollars yeah it was a big deal for us that was our biggest deal so far is like hard for us to like get the money together and and raise the money for it um nine million bucks and then we bought another small property after that another you know portfolio after that included on the same one our basis is about 15 million and I got my spreadsheet up here yeah total cost total cost but but you're in for uh uh 20 of 15 right because you only put or 25 down yeah exactly right so we we put about 30 down we have you know 12 million in debt because we refined it we find out some cash but now it's got a million dollars of net operating income and it's a you know 20 20 million dollar plus property which is great that's crazy yeah I remember seeing that check well what do you want to talk about today I want to talk about all types of stuff dude we have can you talk about the shepherd thing that you're doing yeah so um that company is a phenomenal company and and it kind of can kick off our uh discussion because my goal real estate's a little bit slow the company's in a really good spot I still spend a ton of time saying thumbs up thumbs down to Deals and thinking strategy and working on it but um I have a lot of time and I also have 30 million impressions a month on Twitter and you know what that's like when you have a podcast like this and the distribution that you have um but yeah my goal right now is to is to build a portfolio of ownership chunks and great small companies you know sweaty startups um and and Austin our friend Austin Reef who founded morning Brew he was supposed to come on today and uh he had like a last minute board meeting so Axel Springer thanks a lot the owner of morning group thanks guys uh but anyway I was like awesome what should we talk about and you and me and Austin were the thing and a group chat and he was like let's talk about because he knows that I hate advertising um and I like make fun of him I used to make fun of them as like an enemy now I make fun of him as a friend and um about how much he makes fun of everybody Sam not really do I I don't know it's good it it you just you just make jokes that are at people's expense and it's hilarious and sometimes they're funny and and I was like Austin what uh what do you want to talk about he's like let's talk about non-ways or non-advertising ways to monetize media followings and you did it so you did it I don't know what your net worth would be or what like the the value of your percentage of your thing would be but you've done it to the tune of like 100 million dollars of real estate that's your non-advertising way of monetizing your audience yeah you're also doing it in like a bunch of sorry go ahead yeah my equity in that is maybe you know 10 to 20 million yeah so and and so that and then like you operate this successful business so it's not like it's just because of Twitter you know you make smart decisions beyond that but you are also doing it a few different ways I'm actually a customer of your other business which is a cost sake business I almost use Shepard which I don't know if you are a part owner or if you're just an affiliate for but you're doing it in a bunch of different ways and I want to talk about the ways that you're monetizing in non-addways of your audience yeah so Shepard is the ideal Story I mean it was late 2020 November December I wanted to hire somebody in the Philippines I met Marshall Haas who owns the poor Shepherd and I was his customer I made a deposit for them to hire somebody and my goal was to get somebody on the phone in my self storage facility that could you know press one to make a payment you're gonna go to this person and they're just gonna process the payments for us just some extra help doing very simple things I gave them actually they built the job description they got me three candidates ready to interview I got on and interviewed them all in the course of an hour and I was absolutely blown away and hired all three of the people I'm like this what was the rate per hour five dollars an hour eight hundred dollars a month to get these people to come and work for my service company and they're awesome yeah they were they were incredible fast forward four hour you know four months later I had 15 of these people working inside of my company and not only were they doing the simple stuff but they were answering sales calls they were guiding the logistics of a customer in a in one of my facilities looking for a specific unit they were just able to do exactly what our American reps do except instead of paying 60 or 70 grand a year they pay we pay you know 10 grand a year so it was a game changer now we have our whole Finance departments in Columbia Shepard has helped us find those folks in Columbia um so the business blew my mind and I went to Marshall in 2022 or 2021 May I said hey I want to be an affiliate of this company like give me a cut of what I can bring in and I'll do some tweeting um at that time they were doing about 50 Grand a month and revenue Shepard was that's 30. that's the net of the net of payouts to the the workers no that's like total revenue total revenue for Shepherd okay as a company as that business the one that like does the head hunting and finds the employees for American companies um so they were doing you know 50 placements a month or less and they were growing fast it was a good company and I started tweeting and pissing off the woke mob and recommending Port Shepard for like a 15 cut of Revenue let's say what those tweets were they're hilarious I would say like I'm going to weather this recession for one main reason my my employees all work for five dollars an hour in the Philippines and they're absolutely incredible and then it made me look like a complete idiot but the woke mob would just blow these threads up totally blow them up we're talking to the tune of three to five million impressions and so that really accelerated the growth of Shepard they're getting a ton of business as it was they started growing like crazy fast forward a year later and Shepard had 7xed the size of that company had had grown by seven seven X and how long one year one year and it wasn't just because of me it wasn't just because of me it's because I started offering folks in Colombia they started doing a ton of work a big part of the puzzle to help it grow so I went to Marshall and I was like Marshall this business is way too good I'm not getting enough money like I want to own part of support Shepherd and he's like no way like that's that's ridiculous you're just you're just an influencer I was like well man I'm gonna go start another company that does exactly this or I could be a partner of yours and he was and he's like he's like okay um you're right like let's make a deal and we negotiated and I own 15 of Shepherd and you fast forward to and what's the deal like you have to keep referring a certain amount of customers no the the payoff was canceled I got 15 of profits and he just trusted me that I was gonna be motivated to continue to do what I do and now once a month I just piss off the woke mob on Twitter I send some newsletter at you know ads and I kind of sit on the board and do a little bit of Ops things and recommend but I mostly just drive those guys and that's when it comes to that well and wait I want I want I need you to redeem yourself really quick because you're like you're like I'm pissing people off but the reality is is that like what's the salary 10 grand a year is what to them yeah these people me and my one of my reps were talking the other day and it's like yeah I bought a house Nick it's incredible I bought a house in the Philippines and I'm like what are you talking about he's like yeah this is my home it's a three bedroom house that I bought and uh me and Dan talk all the time that our that our employees in Colombia and the Philippines are are just as wealthy as us they have the same exact lifestyle as we do because yeah they get on a bus they commute two hours and they work for like you know two dollars an hour over there with with not the best conditions and then they get to work for American companies and it changes their lives so the reality is that the local mob has no idea what they're talking about this is incredible opportunity for them and for us um and now a lot of people are you know making that switch and getting employees over there so all right I I interrupted you because I wanted you to redeem yourself but what were you saying about uh so you fast forward a year now in another year of promoting and the business growing and I think 51 of their their businesses repeat customers who want to come back forget to get more um you know help but it's a multi-seven figure profit business a year um I make 50 Grand a month personally from my 15 ownership and Shepherd God that's so funny dude you would not have wanted to go and start a competitor to them would you that would it sounds hard it sounds like a hard business to operate it's really hard they got 150 employees I was mostly bluffing I mean it's a super hard business to start they have a ton of really good talent and a ton of like sales reps and like the way that they do business is really difficult they got to go and recruit and interview all these people over there and vet them and grade their English and like get all these people these employees put to put in front of these business owners so yeah um it was and Marshall's a pretty good entrepreneur I like Marshall a lot I mean he's done like eight different companies and a few of them very very well very good entrepreneur so yeah that's hilarious I can't believe you you worked that out I mean I think that's a good deal I've had so I've had a few people so I there's this guy who did this guy Diego um what's his website is it like short Z I think it's like like short clips I'll have to find it but anyway he uh this dude dm'd me yeah I think he's is he Cuban or he's not from America I forget what he is but he uh he DMS me and I get these DMS all the time so they're like I'm gonna make videos for you you get those with like I wanna I'm like dude shut up okay we have three a day that people want to write my newsletter for me yeah it's like stuff like that all the time and nine out of ten of them they're just like really bad they're not good uh at what they do and this guy just kept dming me and I was like screw it fine like just make clips for me send me 10 of them like I just said something stupid or something like that just to like get them off my back any like within before the night was over he sent me like 10 and they were pretty good and uh I was like uh all right well I don't want to post these I'm gonna make you post them for me I'm gonna give you my Instagram password um send me a picture of your driver's license your social security card and he told me at one point he lived with his girlfriend some of your girlfriend's driver's license too and he sends me a picture of all of them but I go great I know a lot about you I'm gonna I'm gonna you know we're gonna have an issue if you screw me here's my password to my Instagram [Laughter] make it work and he does and he kills it and I go from like a thousand followers to like 10 000 followers in a week and then like up now to fifty thousand he kills how much do you pay him so get this so I was like all right you're right you're awesome but here's the deal you're gonna do this for me for free for a long time and in exchange I'm gonna tell all of my friends about you and uh I'm eventually once you prove it to my friends I'm gonna tweet out that I think you're great um and he said great and so within a month of him messaging me we got him up to like 20 grand a month or something like that I forget like a really good wage um and he's like has his thriving business and then I tweet him out and we send tons of customers to him and so I also do the same thing where I take a small percentage of the profits and I'm loving this but I would rather have the profits rather than equity in the business but really I think you mean like a cut a cut of Revenue you'd have a revenue rather have a revenue share than Equity slice sent me a text yesterday and said Nick what's your three biggest regrets in life and one of them he asked you that question what a weird question to ask he works on he works on this dumbass content online who knows what he's going to Tweet about why is he asking you that okay go ahead one of them was not going to Marshall a year earlier and getting Equity instead of freaking a cut of profits yeah uh yeah I I just don't know if a clip agency is ever going to sell yeah I love agency I love agency businesses and I I don't want to like give advice to people all the time do you know what I mean I think it's different when you're with Marshall because Marshall is like a very proven entrepreneur who has a couple exits unders underspelled but like sometimes he doesn't want to listen yeah they don't need or want me to get involved in their operations yeah yeah I'm like dude I don't want to like uh I don't want to guide you I just want to send you customers and um I like I sometimes I prefer transactional is what I mean um yeah so I love leaning in I love leaning into the Ops my business partner is an operational Mastermind and you know yeah I have three other companies that I'm working on launching right now on a very same very similar trajectory as support Shepherd by the way Diego's company is called short it's like a short clip and then zy dot Co short Z dot Co so short and then zy.com yeah man you should own you should own 25 of his company um yeah I don't know maybe maybe I will end up regretting that but I'm I'm happy with the deal yeah but we uh and so uh what were the other two regrets oh um I don't know let me look I think it was um go ahead and get married a little earlier and have kids a little earlier even though I did it when I was almost 30. um and then you aren't married until you're 30 or first kid I got married when I was 27 I had my first kid at 29 and I kind of if that was three years earlier I would have been just as happy but in general how many so many people I talked to say they wish they would have had their kids earlier by the way and I'm shocked that people say that are you are you excited to be a dad at some point I know you and Sarah started to talk about it are you what do you what do you think about how do you think that's going to change your life I'm pumped I'm so pumped I I think that um a I agree I wish I would have done it earlier um and I am so pumped I think it's gonna be life-changing I think I was talking to Sarah about this last night I was like so we've achieved a lot of like interesting things at a relatively young age like professionally like we're known in our field and like we have some respect amongst some peers financially like we've achieved some things um like and then we were like parents say like well you're never ready and I was thinking last night I'm like dude I'm totally ready like what else do I need to do this is like it feels like the next step so I'm incredibly ready and I don't really care about this but I actually think it's going to Turbo Charge my career um I think that like it's gonna make you feel like amped up like before it was I was earning so I don't know why I was earning I was trying to make money for ego egotistical reasons and then after that I was like now I'm in the place where I make money because I do [ __ ] that's fun and because of my fun hobbies often the outcome is income I pick and choose different things now I think it's gonna feel like I want something for my children I want to impress them um I want to show them how to work hard I think that there's going to be like a little bit of that and it's also going to be like I don't want to spend all of my time uh after like 6 p.m working and so I have to pick and choose my battles and I think that's gonna actually Force focus and the outcome will be better financially am I wrong I think you are right on the money with your two things there's two more number one is that you are going to get so much more emotionally mature when you have kids at least for me I was highs lows I would it just it just puts stress in relative form when you know you have a human that you have to care for and the stress level of when that human is sick or when when they scream or when they cry or when they hurt themselves when they suffer that puts it all in perspective so you just get like better at dealing with stress the second thing is like I got more focused I was able to get more work done when I couldn't travel the world I couldn't go play golf all the time I couldn't just get on a plane and go be spontaneous and go spend two weeks in Europe so instead I would spend really good quality time with my family in my house and then pop to my computer to you know Tinker inside of my business and make my business better I was just more I don't know does that make sense yeah it totally makes sense and I'm pumped we have three kids now yeah five five three and nine months yeah man I'm I'm pumped for it and I I think the I don't care about this but I think the outcome will be a better career because of children that's that that's my prediction I think you're right I want to talk about the cost seg business because that thing so that seems like it's going even better than um support Shepherd so uh I'm a customer I used it I got it for free though so I I am a customer and I uh you did a video so cost tag is we have Engineers who go in and they break out the different parts of a commercial property or an income property a piece of real estate and then they give you a schedule of which you can depreciate that to the IRS meaning like because normally is what 27 years it's normally 27 years straight line depreciation they take it so that oh the windows those are only a five-year life you know the Landscaping outside that only has a five-year life then you got all these ground improvements that we're going to make and all these other things that can be accelerated a little faster so and there's something called bonus depreciation we're going away in the weeds you don't need to know that but basically our Engineers come in the building they draw a picture of the property they split it out into different values and they give you a document that you can go to the IRS to get way more depreciation and save money you're one so I haven't gotten my I haven't gotten my report yet though but let's just make believe on a million dollar property that what's a million divided by 27 is what yeah 27 000 is it 27 000 a year yeah okay and depreciation duh uh 2.2 maybe something like that and then on um with this it would be what like 200 Grand in year one yeah on a self storage facilities anywhere from 20 to 30 percent year one depreciation um an industrial property might be 10 to 20 and RV park might be 60 70 it just depends on how many ground how much ground improvements you've done like work to the outside of the property Landscaping you know when do I pay that tax back if I sell the property before 27 years um yeah it's called recapture so if you don't plan to hold the property for a while then you need to keep some money because your basis drops basically your taxable basis drops by the amount that you'd appreciate so that Gap is called recapture and you pay that at the recapture rate stuff like that so yeah and where's my team doing this um we have my friend Mitchell Baldridge who you know his wife Mel um they are my partners my business partner Dan is minority owner as well um I own 45 of Ari kosseg and I mean Mitchell Mitchell had done 100 plus of these before we started this company and he'd never really thought about hey uh we can we can find some engineers and do this stuff really well um we've created a Twitter account Ari kosteg we got really competitive pricing because instead of me flying somebody to your property in Texas we did a FaceTime you facetimed with one of our guys and he walked around took some screenshots what was that like my property manager did it and I was out there with her and I think she was on her phone I wish she was on her phone and she said the guy sounded Italian are they in Italy or something they're all over yeah we have some people in Miami um Florida's pretty popular Colombia Philippines we've hired uh seven people from support through support Shepherd for this company um it's which is another funny part about it but yeah we have 23 23 employees uh Mitchell's wife Mel who spent eight years at KPMG or uh yeah yeah one of the big one of the big consulting firms she was a Management Consultant she's the CEO of the company and yeah we're nine months old and we did 250 000 of Revenue last month dude that's crazy and I remember like so uh Jen my PM it took her like 20 or 30 minutes until my property's big it's like 20 acres but there's like a 4 000 square foot house and then um like a barn that has a gym it's this for an Airbnb I have and she like spent maybe 20 minutes walking around and he was like what's that thing and they're like oh that's like our water purifying system and he's like all right cool let me see that all right cool uh show me all the windows yeah they look like okay what can we depreciate faster and they're like show me this show me that yeah yeah and he and she was like we have two garage doors here and he was like all right cool let me see that garage door uh I forget what else it was but uh like like she was just walking around and he like had a checklist but then also he would see stuff and like ask like wait let me see that uh water filtration system or like uh you know this my properties out in the country so we have like a a well or something and I think she was like let me see the well like like you like wanted to see all this stuff and I haven't gotten the report yet I think we just get it did it like 10 or seven days ago yeah and there's one other company in the space that's doing it that I almost went with it was called the Madison spec is yep yeah they'll fly somebody out to your property and they'll charge you twice as much to do a cost effect because they gotta get somebody out there so it's a different scenario when I read about this uh Mark Jenny so we have this friend named Mark Jenny who talked about the party he's a badass yeah he's badass he has like I don't know his portfolio is like mid eight figures of Airbnb the bar stool guys rented one of his houses for Super Bowl week dude I saw the so the Barstool guys are in Arizona I think for yeah and I saw like the mini Putt-Putt course in basketball and I was like I bet this is Marx and then you or someone else told us that it was Marx and he uh I was he's inspired me to get into airbnbs I was like Mark what should I read and he like sent me some book and he told and that's what I learned about accelerated depreciation and I started Googling how to how to do it and I only found a couple firms doing it so I thought this was going to be like a niche business I didn't think it was gonna be like a big business what how big do you think this is gonna get my prediction and again I I try not to make predictions because then I just set expectations and end up getting you know stressed because of expectations and stress and that stuff but yeah I think we'll do three to five million of Revenue over the next 12 months and I think about I think it'll become a it'll become over the next five years a 10 to 15 million dollar a year Revenue business I don't I mean you don't have to set expectations but I will but I feel like that is under shooting it I think it could be potentially bigger I don't know how big the market is but I bet you there's just so many other services that you can begin to offer depending on how hard you want to work yeah we're launching so that's recast.com we're launching tax credit hunter.com as well to do ERC credits and employee retention credits same leadership group Mitchell Mitchell and Mel um that's when you didn't if you didn't lay off employees during covid and you own a small business you can get um into employee retention tax credits back from the IRS and you need Metro you need Michelin to really talk about that stuff I can't um guide but basically if you didn't fire your employees when covet hit and you kept them on the government is offering massive tax credits to your business and very few entrepreneurs know it they expire in 2025 and yeah it's it's it's significant we're talking the guys that we know who are running companies with 150 employees are looking at 100 to a million dollars in tax credits 100 000 million there's a company called Main Street Main Street they do the exact same thing I think Sean either invested or knows the guy who founded it named Doug and they were an Advertiser with the hustle they're a good company but what they did was how much money did they raise I think they raised they did the exact same thing you're saying they probably had like a Tech play to it I don't remember exactly but they're still around but I think they raised like two or three hundred million dollars like a I forget the exact number but like a huge amount and I think they just recently laid off a ton of people not because the business stinks but I think they just like raised a ton of money and hired a ton of people um but I do think that that's proof that this if I'm in your position and I'm like oh well you guys have just validated the idea and concept we're not going to raise money because we don't want to screw up our cap table but I bet we can do this because we already have a little bit of money we already have an audience maybe we won't grow as fast but we'll own the whole thing and do it our way and I think yeah the audience is the key I mean the the re Costa Twitter account which I I run in Mitchell runs uh it's got 13 over 13 000 followers already no [ __ ] what are you Tweeting on there that make people follow it um just all about Costa all about Real Estate Investors client examples Anonymous client examples about how much money we save clients um it blows people's mind when they realize that Real Estate Investors you can make I mean I'm an example of this you can make two three million dollars a year from operating companies and if you're a real estate professional and you buy property each year and you cost seg them and appreciate them you can have zero tax liability zero yeah but becoming a real estate professional is a pain in the butt I try to do it I try to do it and I I was like there's no way I can justify like basically to if I remember correctly to become a real estate professional you have to uh I forget exactly 700 hours you have to spend you have to be the person who spends the most time in the business yeah there's you need a good CPA to really like log your time and create a rock solid case and then you also have to I think a certain I think of the majority of your income has to come from Real Estate if I remember correctly or you can't is there something where like the where is it like you're outside your all your revenue streams can't add up to be more than your uh than your uh real estate income is it something like that I thought that there was something where like you can't make too much money well maybe I'm wrong but I remember the 700 thing I was like there's no way I can qualify I think you can get some Advent I think you can get some I don't want to talk out of my ass here I don't remember exactly but I think if you do 360 hours you can you can get some uh uh short-term rentals short-term rentals there's a loophole in it right now we're doing a ton of cost things on people who have short-term rentals because they don't have to be a real estate professional they just have to spend more time on that rental property than anybody else and there's some threads that Mitchell Baldridge has and if you search it if you search short-term rental on the re costume account you can read the thread but yeah it's a there's a loophole around uh short-term rentals well that's sick dude I think that potentially those businesses can be bigger than like your storage thing but that's just because that's what I know is like internet businesses but I think that actually could be pretty massive right I think I I'm very bullish on what could happen I'm excited yeah and then I'm also buying a I'm buying and rebranding a Property and Casualty Insurance company they provide property insurance like if you have a commercial piece of property a self storage facility or a multi-family unit you need to get property insurance on that in case there's a tornado or a fire or somebody slips and Falls outside yeah I mean I have it at my Airbnb I think yeah I think it's expensive I'm pretty sure I pay five or six thousand a year does that sound right yeah that sounds right we pay over 400 000 or over 350 000 annually to ensure our self storage portfolio but it's also a pain to work with these insurance companies like the brokerages operate like it's 1950 you have to prove yeah I don't have like a login I think I just have like a PDF that like they sent me and then they sent me more questions that said like hey did you ever fix this handrail or something like that yeah and uh anyway like it's pretty Antiquated it's my business partner we were working with a top 10 firm in the country brokerage firm top ten this is one of the biggest companies and my business partner Dan had to go into that business and build a system for them to quickly get us quotes on properties and to bind our coverage we can't pay online things move slow as hell nobody responds to us so yeah we're buying an insurance company in Kansas City we're rebranding it as Titan risk titanrisk.com is the shout out and we're gonna spin up a Property and Casualty Insurance Company on the back of again the the the following uh your website's down so you gotta is it titanrisk.com you said yeah all right yeah it'll be up it'll be up by tomorrow hopefully all right good I I don't know I think this episode might go live tomorrow so you gotta get it up by then on Thursday what uh what did you pay for that um the guy was doing he he we found a guy who had a really good contract base with carriers because that's the key like everybody goes the same carriers but you have to have contracts with those really good carriers um we found a guy in Kansas City who had that and he was I think he's doing million million and a half of Revenue inside of a shop he's the producer he has four back office we're gonna hire folks through Shepard and some Americans as well um account admins and we're gonna lean on his shop at the beginning and kind of spin up a secondary brand so so if I come on if I come on in six months I'd give you I'd be able to share a ton because this is in its infancy but I'm more excited about this business than I am about um Ari Costa again and uh type tax tax credit Hunter our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better I want to ask you about the fourth one but for the first three did you put up any capital for any of them yeah we funded a checking account um for Ari Costa we put 50 Grand in there and then the two months later you know we were making distributions that's nothing right that's not that enough and dude that's crazy to me the great thing about hiring an employee even if you hire a really good engineer for a hundred thousand dollars you're only paying them 8 300 a month do you have Engineers for these companies yeah you need we have civil engineers inside of our Acosta so yeah it's this is this stuff's not easy right Mel Baldridge is a badass like she's managing 23 people we're doing a ton of volume of sales doing all these CAD drawings breaking down these properties Marshall's team is really badass like none of these companies are Easy by any means who's building the system so like and not civil engineers but I mean like uh web yeah we're using air table as a CRM um we have a lot of out of the pocket Tech but yeah we're getting some web work done as well and I'm starting a a web a web landing page front-end development company as well called webron.com but that's with another guy that's going to be spun up in the next month so yeah I mean it's getting it's getting fun I want to ask you about this last one and then uh I want to ask you more questions about all this stuff I'm gonna write my questions down because I don't want to interrupt you what's this pest thing oh The Pest Control business um I have an LP a good friend of mine who owns Six branches of a pest control company and he needs to he needs Capital to go buy additional properties and he's got some Capital but not you know five or ten million dollars and I said properties I meant additional companies to latch on to his to his business but um I might do a deal with him where I sit on the board and I advise operationally I help them hire overseas Talent through support Shepard and Implement them inside the company and then uh raise the money from my Real Estate Investors to buy the business but that's in its infancy as well I need more time to to really talk on that so um about between two and six months ago Sean and I on this pod talked about a few things I told him I was like basically like on Instagram you have like Rihanna and the Kardashians and then there's like thousands and thousands of more but those two those the the Kardashians and Rihanna are like two prominent examples of people who have built hundreds of millions or billions of dollars worth of uh net worth via Instagram on YouTube we have Mr bees he's like the common he's the one everyone talks about um and then you know there's way more uh of people who have built like there's the lady who started Ipsy I think it's called the makeup brand there's just tons of them on Facebook you could say that like BuzzFeed and like uh um a bunch of other people like you know built multi-billion dollar businesses on the backs of Facebook now there hasn't really been one who's done it on Twitter the and Snapchat same thing we can think of a few more examples the reason Twitter maybe it hasn't worked is because I think people haven't taken it seriously and also there's only like 350 million people on it as opposed to Instagram there's like what billions but I think that's changing and what we haven't seen yet is someone who has built like the the equivalent of the Kardashians uh on Twitter except instead of selling makeup I think they're going to be selling B2B or professional whatever that is considered you know B2B services or uh something where it's like a higher end person not a young woman buying like 12 makeup and um we haven't seen that yet and then Sean was like yeah and then we have like the guy Mafia so you have people like the strip mall it's like these Anonymous accounts like the strip mall guy who I know who he is I'm friends with him and he is a large business and I I don't know what it what has come from Twitter but he has large business and then there's like five or six other guys there's like the used car salesperson guy and he's like potentially going to build a large business and like it's very predictable luxury watch guys is selling shitloads of watches on Twitter yeah I almost bought a Rolex from he like had these datejust that I wanted no one has done this to the extent of like hundreds of millions I guess you kind of almost have already but no one has done this to the extent that I think possible you might be one of the first or at least one of the people that I know closely who might be one of these early people to build a multi-hundred million or even a billion dollar Fortune mostly because of your audience on Twitter do you think that's that's uh uh accurate I think these companies are so in so in their infancy and it's really easy to get to 250 Grand of Revenue but ask guys like Andrew Wilkinson how hard it is to go from 250 000 a month to you know 250 million dollars a year in Revenue like those types of jumps is on another level right I don't know if I have what it takes to do things like that but you give it 10 or 15 years to mature I don't know I think what Austin Reef does at morning Brew like managing these bigger companies is just a different skill set it's different like but you're not doing it but I'd have to become a billionaire wouldn't I I don't know because dude it's kind of like you're like the Ryan Reynolds of Twitter a little bit you know what I mean like he's got mint mobile he has the soccer team that he partakes in he's got uh I don't the the alcohol drink that he has uh I think he has a few more I I mean that guy's not operating those companies Conor McGregor's not operating the whiskey thing but like and I can't operate frankly I can't operate my companies either I'm focused on my real estate and everything else yeah and so my point being is if you're just if you have 10 to 20 or 30 percent of a handful of things one of them could hit there's this guy named Felix Dennis have you ever read uh this awesome book called How to get rich I love that book yeah I love that book I recommend that book to everyone it's horribly titled but it's the best book I've ever you should have equity in that book Sam dude I I whenever we mention in the Pod well notice the next day it goes up the charts like a ton and uh well he's dead now but he he built like a publishing Empire that was like it made him a lot of money but the bulk of his wealth was he owned 10 or 20 of this thing called micro Warehouse which went public for multi-billions and he made many many hundreds of millions from it and he had the same thing where he was like look I own the magazines that I'm gonna promote you guys in there for free and I'm also going to be like an advisor but I'm going to be considered a co-founder and this was my idea and I hired you guys but he didn't manage the company he met with the with the other Founders a lot and he gave it his uh opinion but he wasn't like running the data day thing I don't see why you you couldn't do that with a few more things I think the you know the power of blowing up a brand is one thing the power of spotting and reading and hiring and delegating to really good operators is something is another thing as well that's underrated and something that I think that I'm good at finding people who really think about business the right way and to build these companies I can't operate them I'm an investor I'm an advisor and I pump their stuff on Twitter and I'm a customer and I you know help but you gotta find somebody who really is really good at running a company and that's where I wish I I made a joke on Twitter that offended a couple of my good friends a couple days ago that said like I need to do more Angel Investing so that I can invest in these companies I can see how these Founders think about business and how they make decisions and how they write their updates and how they fight through and I can get a look into their brain and I can spot The Killers right I can find those those guys that are just really good at business and then I can pull them aside when they give up and I made a a statement like the hell you know when they want to leave the hellscape that is Venture Capital that's not true um it was it was uh it was just not cool for me to say that about my buddies who had so much value to the world in that space but anyway and you're joking I was I was half joking half being serious because I want to pull these people away and and basically found and start and buy businesses that I think they could come in and run great businesses that are ran like crap and just accelerate their growth and make them better dude Austin reef is an amazing operator and um I remember when I first met him I was probably 28 or 29 or 30 and he's younger than me he's four years younger than me and I was like you're the first person you're one of the very few people who's like my peer but younger than me who I'm I'm a little intimidated by I'm like you you I I I remember telling him I was like dude I'm a lot better than you had a few things you are so much better than me at a few other things and I wish I was looking for the way that he listening to the way that he thinks about business problems and the way that he talks through them and the way that he paints a story in a clear and concise way when you're asking him about his business is that's what I'm talking about that's the 10xer Austin is the 10x series 100x totally he's on another level but like when you're around a lot of these people and you talk to them you start asking questions and hearing the way they think about business you can do it too like you can just tell you can tell when somebody's different when somebody's really got it you know what I mean he's the best but I would also say like Andrew Wilkinson's a great friend of mine I don't know what his Empire's worth but in the 500 to a billion range depending on public markets he uh when I talked to him I don't feel like I'm like Andrew I don't feel you're out of my league you've just been doing it for longer and you are really creative and you were the first person you were you were Bolder and smarter than than me to like believe that this could actually become a thing and you did the thing and then you did it for years and years and you didn't give up and you never bowed down you always did it your way but in terms of like your vision and my vision you know my vision now that I see you could do it I'm like I don't think your ball I think we're in the same ballpark of like intellect um and so that's why when I see him I'm like dude you're inspiring to me because I kind of feel like we're almost the same although the results are not the same and I find that to be very inspirational and that's kind of the same for you maybe like you look at a guy like him and be like oh man Andrew is my idol yeah I mean that man understands leverage and delegation unlike anybody that I've ever met right he can find somebody he can he can his his brain is so good at analyzing the pros and the cons of making a bet he does business like a poker player right when the odds are in his favor he's gonna go big and he's just proven that he he can make those bets better than anybody else he'd find those excellent operators and I think he's an undercover killer too I mean I know that he comes off really humble but the dude is I think he's a killer too he's a killer and anyone who's that successful is not not a killer uh yeah you're right he and he does a good job because he's like is a I always tease him I'm like dude you're always dressed so nice when you have slick back hair like you like have this like designer like uh look to you but like you're like quit acting like you're like uh not a killer because you definitely are he's got it why what do you what do you do with your bunny do you what do you invest in um well real estate I'm not that liquid right I haven't sold a company I haven't sold any properties so I personally guarantee you know 50 million dollars plus of debt and I only have 3.6 million dollars liquid so I'd be foolish to start spending that on houses cars and boats right so um I keep a lot of cash about a million in cash I keep another another two and a half million in public equities that I can create are you Trading buy stocks and hold them for a long time I'm way too dumb to try to guess what's going to happen inside of them but you didn't used to be that way um I bought some dumb we talked about our friend Austin Reef I bought some dumb stocks that I then sold six months later for a big loss absolutely but I'm not trying to day trade in time markets awesome tell us all that that Zillow was like the buy he was like but I it was a fair argument but we bought it at 150 bucks it went up to 200 and I was getting texts from Austin that the that you know let's let's go this is incredible now it's 30 bucks or something um but no I mean Google and Facebook and Microsoft and Apple all the best companies in the world all got 50 percent cheaper so I bought a lot of those and I'm gonna hold them for five years and I'm sure that I'll do fine what's motivating you right now I just think it's fun I mean the building the building is really fun is that what you I mean I want to talk about you now too Sam because you're you're not over here how many years post exit are you four years out no dude two two two years okay never mind um yeah I mean you build something you sell something you have that event and then when it's over you're like oh [ __ ] I kind of I love I love building I love tinkering I love entrepreneurship and business I needed so I gave myself one year to I basically wrote the rules where I was like I'm gonna read anything that interests me whether that's so I read a lot of fiction and I read I don't read business books anymore um and then I also said I'm just gonna search I'm just gonna search so I'm just gonna plot and search and just whatever interest me I'm just gonna pursue it you know I was like I was like I'm just gonna a dog on a walk file on my nose and I'm not gonna like feel guilty about that and I noticed that after about six months I was ready to roll again I made some mistake I made some irreversible decisions at my company like some culture decisions basically when I started the company I was 25 and then when I about sold it I was about 30 and like I was a different person and I'm more solid on who I am now so I would have different values when I start in my next things but anyway I made some mistakes so I basically kind of had to sell the company or in order to like get out and so I was pumped about it but at the same time I was like I wish I was wealth I wish I was I wasn't wealthy when I started a business I had nothing I was like I wish I was wealthy so I didn't have to sell this to get liquidity because I would have liked to have owned it forever but I was very very very happy to get that time to relax and to seek and then after about six months I was like dude I need action I need to gamble I felt I remember watching a James Bond movie and I'm like should I become a cop like I need to go out and like get into trouble like I need to experience like it's the real certainty I think it's like it's the it's making a decision where you don't know what the answer is going to be and then waiting and seeing what happens that is just incredibly addicting about entrepreneurship dude I just like like being a [ __ ] with my friends I love our group chat like when it gets spicy I like think about it all the time like it's so funny and I'm like I gotta go do something now to one-up the the guys here and that's how I feel so like my my best the best time I have that I love the best when it comes to work is when I'm with like my partner Joe or someone like that and we're like we can't pull this off can we ah [ __ ] let's go try it like that that adrenaline that's like my version of like James Bond when I'm watching him like having like a car chase I'm like dude let's this is our this is our nerdy version of a card Chase I need that thrill and it just so happens that the outcome typically is money and so that's what I'm motivated by is like the thrill um I don't give a [ __ ] about Legacy when people talk about Legacy I'm like I don't give a [ __ ] dude I'm gonna I'm like imagine the feeling that you had when you before you were born that's what I think I'm gonna have when I'm dead why do I care what people think about me you know I want to like leave something to my children because I love them but like I don't give a [ __ ] about what everyone else thinks I don't care about Legacy I just want to have fun and like have excitement in the moment and that's what I'm motivated by yeah I'm making these making these business deals and these business decisions and these in these calculated bets we'll call them like been with you and and all these things I'm working on there just calculated bets and when you when you put the money in you just never know what's gonna happen you never know what's gonna happen when you try to sell it when you start to get customers when you start to solve problems and it's it's addicting for sure by the way well we can keep this on but producer Ben we have to bleep out the name of what he just said I haven't announced that yet but can we talk about it can we yeah yeah we can't say what it is but we can we can we can mention I have a thing that I'm going to be announcing in a month Nick just said the name of it we got to bleep that out I'll be announcing it in one month I've been doing it low-key for two reasons one I wanted to prove that I can do it without my audience um and two I wanted to make sure that it worked and was life-changing It's a Wonderful product before I like get like an influx but I'm gonna announce that in a month um what else we want to talk about anything else I mean I mean I've been thinking a little bit about like what holds people back and anxiety and the decision making that like you have anxiety no I just mean like the uncertainty like the the fear of failure like it's it's in everybody not not that I guess anxiety is a is a bad term more like insecurity right I have insecurity and the and it holds me back from making big decisions and the problem with it is is the more insecure you are the less decisions you make and decision making is like something that you have to practice to get really good at if you don't make decisions with a lot on the line you have to you're never going to get better at it ever going to get better at it so then you have unmade decisions and that equals stress because stress is a decision that hasn't yet been made and it just cycles and snowballs so people who are they have insecurity they have anxiety around making decisions then they get stressed out because they have these decisions and it's just a big compounding snowball of of like it just holds people back from kicking so much ass like every High performer that I know they make a ton of decisions they make some of them wrong they lose some money like there's downside of course but they just make them and make them and make them and they make them quick and they get better at it and better at it and better at it and that's when The Leverage kicks in and they can just build and grow a Build and Grow my parents when I was a younger kid I would like sell CDs or like sell used stuff on eBay and I remember making mistakes and they're like oh that's all right you can't get a hit unless you're in the game and uh I was there like uh you're swinging your Miss but you know you gotta you gotta swing to get the hit and you can't get hit unless you're in the game I remember hearing that and that like changed my life and so now whenever I screw up I'm like ah whatever like you know a 300 batting average in baseball is great so I'm like that's all I need like that and business is fine in fact in business you actually need less if you try 100 times and one thing works it makes up for all the 99 things um but that's what I always tell people I'm like dude you gotta you gotta you can't get a hit unless you're in the game I've been asking High performers this because now I have a five-year-old I'm thinking about what I can do for my kids to help them just get better at making decisions and get you know more a more solid foundation a more solid foundation in the event of insecurity did your parents just like let you struggle a little bit like that's something that I found is very common among entrepreneurs and successful people because so many parents nowadays they really mess up because they like shelter their kids from all decision making they like make the decisions for the kids they like they they keep them from getting in any pain at all they're going to keep them from having to deal with the uncomfort of pain they're gonna put them in a bubble and I look back on my parents and my my parents would like they would make me make the little decisions when I was a kid so that I got better at making the decisions and then when they were bigger I wasn't overwhelmed with fear and insecurity I was always skateboarding and rollerblading and going to skate parks and I remember I had a unicycle I would and I would try to write it downstairs and they were like I was crazy I was like do all this crazy stuff I remember when I was in fourth grade I could ride a unicycle and juggle and I would do all this crazy like skateboarding [ __ ] and they would be like uh hey let's go to the skate park uh but the only rules they had was you have to wear a helmet they go as long as you wear a helmet we don't care and so I was in and out of the hospital broken broken broken fingers uh stitches on my eye broke my arm broke my collarbone I've had a lot of broken bones and they were I always say my parents they once I uh left school I wasn't financially uh like they didn't they've never like helped me with the business or anything but they supported me up until then and so I had that but they were emotionally supportive so I remember when I left school and moved up to San Francisco and told them I was going to join this thing called Airbnb they were like this sounds like a multi-level marketing thing like is this and I was like no guys like this like I think it's legit like at the time I was like two or three hundred people worked there it's legit and they're like you're gonna leave school to go do this and I was like yeah it's legit and they're like that sounds horrible but uh you know we'll see you Saturday we'll come down there and help you move out and so like they did things like that that were like very emotionally supportive and so and that was like huge and so a lot of my friends who don't take risks oftentimes their parents were quite neurotic and they instead of saying um why uh instead of saying like of course this can work they would default to saying like well this will never work because of this this and this or like you can't go study abroad like Mexico is dangerous haven't you seen that there's like shootings or uh you know like people get sick when they uh do this and that like I remember like that was usually the default versus like screw it we'll we'll handle it when we get there yeah putting your kids in a bubble and now that I have a five-year-old like it sucks to watch him struggle and I have a bunch of employees and it sucks to watch I I don't know there's there's a lot of similarities between like raising your kid get hurt though like let's say your kids riding a bike and he's wearing a helmet and you're like dude he's 100 about to knock his teeth out um if he's about to hurt himself bad and I'm gonna go to the emergency room obviously I'm gonna run and try to catch him but if he's over on the other side of the cul-de-stack a knee it's a curb and he falls down and he starts screaming I'm not gonna Sprint over there and pick him up and coddle him does that make sense like I'm gonna yeah I'm gonna let him I'm gonna let him figure that crap out but I just think it bleeds over into everything like if you if an employee walks into your office and that they have a problem and you just say get out of my way I'm going to solve that problem then that enables that enables them to a it doesn't let them learn how to solve problems on their own and be it enables them to bring you more and more problems and just be completely unable to like get [ __ ] done without you as a boss um do you uh Ben just texted me and he wanted he wanted me to ask you you have all three boys right I have a five-year-old boy three-year-old boy two uh all right ten month old girl are you gonna raise her the same way I would imagine yes right oh man I don't know I don't know if I will yeah if I have a daughter I mean this is my I'm hypothetical you're living it but I think I would definitely you gotta do it the same way right yeah oh yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna raise strong secure daughter for sure like hey I'm going to show her that I'm going to treat her mother with a ton of respect and that her mother should never take [ __ ] from me just because I'm a man right that's that's something like you [ __ ] women in the long run if you like enable or like lead them to be insecure so I'm gonna try to raise like a really strong confident secure girl who can yeah knows how to struggle with grace absolutely so when she falls down on her bike not gonna run over there either I guess well good dude I'm happy you came on I like talking to you um by the way we do this thing on on our YouTube channel I'm gonna do it now I'm supposed to do it earlier on we talk about the gentleman's agreement have you heard me say this I have not damn you're catching me I'm totally blind so we we've been growing our YouTube subscribers at I think last month we grew by twenty thousand and the pitch was this which I stole it from this guy named Jesse on fire so I'm not gonna act like I came up with it but it was uh we guilted people a little bit we said hey hold on hold on I normally say this in the beginning I forgot to do today go hold on unlike everything else on YouTube our content is not for free we actually work for you and the way that you pay us back it's kind of like when you go up and buy a uh you up to 7-Eleven and you see like a jar for the muscle Dystrophy and you take a piece of candy and you leave a quarter or you leave a dollar that's what this YouTube channel is except instead of the dollar all you gotta do is click like And subscribe on on our little Channel and we work for you and so our content's not free you have to subscribe if you watch more than one video and it's called The Gentleman's Agreement because we're not there it's a handshake so anyway that is the gentleman's agreement so you do have to subscribe to our Channel but dude that pitch changed everything immediately we started close seeing close to a thousand people a day clicking subscribe so it's working so you got to have like a unique way of asking for it and it's worked and so now we have all types of people coming up to us I had I was riding my I was on a walk yesterday the guy drove by and goes hey I honored the gentleman's agreement I swear to God in Austin I had two people last week uh say that to me so anyway that's our gentleman's agreement so if you're listening if you've ever listened to more than one episode this is the gentleman's agreement it's an honor System you have to do it and we can't check this on you but please do it everyone's doing it

and again remember percentage of their readers are ultra wealthy people who are like yeah great I want to have a home on on the East Coast that I can park my private plane in and that'll be one of my Hubs and I'm pretty sure okay I don't know the exact numbers on this but I can triangulate a little bit I think they've done at least 25 million in pre-sales on this thing that is crazy it could be it could easily be double that but um but that is a a really awesome and impressive like way to take this Niche hobby take find a find a kind of media publication that that works and go content to Commerce [Music] I have a I have some stuff for today you have something that I know about that I've kind of mentioned but I mentioned it without saying their name Craig Fuller now we can't mention it did you get permission from uh about this uh yeah um I think so so we got uh some of this is public but let's let's talk a little bit about this okay so there's this there's this business called uh flying magazine or flying mag and um so when you look at it you're like okay well what is this and so basically the story is there's a guy who bought this magazine called Flying mag and flying mag produces this beautiful magazine amazing photos and if you're a flying or Aviation Enthusiast you will love this magazine he bought it for like I think like not quite 10 million but a little under that so maybe somewhere between let's call it five to ten million dollars my guess is a fraction of that I think it was closer to one do you have any anything I've got a little Source here saying hi seven figures so let's Okay Okay assume the source is correct okay so um but then I was like well where did this person get high seven figures to go drop on a magazine that seems like a pretty indulgent purchase for somebody unless they have a lot of money so he started a company before that called Freight waves which uh basically is like a data company for the freight shipping industry so they're like a uh a price reporting company so they they provide data that shippers and freight companies use to um you know inform themselves on what's going on in the market they also have a SAS tool so they kind of have like a media side which is the you know content that they're producing that's pricing information and then they have a SAS business called sonar that's in it and they've released a public press release so you can kind of see his numbers I saw they did that that's very weird that they did that yeah they're not a public company but they sort of like did a public report and I'm not sure what the agenda was like I think I'm just sort of naive here I don't know I normally this is we want somebody to buy us or we want to raise money um or we're prepping to go public but it's I don't think it's either any of those three uh because of what they said so they basically reported uh 13 million in revenue for a quarter so let's call it let's just extrapolate that out in a straight line so roughly 50 million a year in Revenue um it wasn't a lot in profit so it was like you know um one or two million in ebitda in the quarter or something like that so let's say that this business is making I don't know four to eight million a profit a year but it's probably 70 a year it's growing physically almost and it's been around I think for a little while um so so you know it's done well they had 28 million in cash just like it on the books on the balance sheet so you know the business was in in a healthy spot so I think Craig starts Freight waves he then separately buys flying mag one of the interesting things about flying mag is that if you think about who are the readers of a niche magazine like this you have two categories Uber nerds and Uber nerds who are rich because you know you got to be kind of nerdy about this hobby if you're going to be like reading about this like we had a guy once who we hired as an engineer that used to had an app on his phone where he would listen to the uh what's called Air Traffic Control he would just tune into the frequency of air traffic control listen to it at lunch and like I gotta tell you never had a worse lunch with anybody in my life dude me him and his phone on with air traffic control was our lunch and I was like you know hey man I'm gonna go back for seconds and then I'm gonna go kill myself so you'll see later this has been horrible thanks I do I do that with the uh I do that with the police scanner you ever deal with the police scanner at least police look there's a show called cops there's no show called safe Landings because that's all Air Traffic Control there's no there's no show called which way is the wind blowing but there babe called that there is a video game where all you are is an air traffic controller yeah fair enough okay so anyways the back to back to my flag mag story so a big percentage of the readers are like rich people with private planes or like you see this a lot in tech for some reason like uh my buddy furcon did this sold this company immediately starts signs up for flying lessons wants to get his Pilot licensed to like go fly this like you know five-seater or six-seater or two-seater plane um they love that Hobby and there's a really expensive hobby um so one thing that they did recently that I think is really smart is have you heard about this this community building in Atlanta so he told me I'm not going to steal your thunder but he told me what he was gonna do and he all he goes I'm flying from New York to go see this property I'm looking at and I'm flying my private plane do you want to come with me and I ended up not going because I had to go up to Teterboro so in New Jersey and then fly back down to Atlanta to see the spot with them but he asked me to go with him and I almost did it and he was and so uh I've known about this for about a year and a half now yeah that's great so and so the the interesting thing is they're basically building a community in Atlanta and I think the reason people build these communities is like there's like a a what's it called like a landing strip like in the middle of the neighborhood so you could park your plane and if you want to take off you could just like go take off it's like like the driveway of the community is like a a landing strip and correct it's it's a it's a so it's a country club with go with homes around the golf course but instead of a golf course it's a landing strip that's exactly what it is so it's a it's a country club Country Club for flying and so you purchase I forget how much a piece of plot of land costs and then they build a build you a home and now you are part of this Aviation community right and so they pre-sold the the plots of of land are the plots of uh for the homes in this community so they find this kind of bare ground or whatever they start pre-selling the plots and again remember a percentage of their readers are ultra wealthy people who are like yeah great I want to have a home on on the East Coast that I could park my private plane in and that'll be one of my Hubs and I'm pretty sure okay I don't know the exact numbers on this but I can triangulate a little bit I think they've done at least 25 million in pre-sales on this thing that is crazy it could be it could easily be double that but um but that is a a really awesome and impressive like way to take this Niche hobby take find a find a kind of media publication that that works and go content to Commerce right this is the um what's the churning group churning group believes in this the content to Commerce so they they did uh which is what hodinki did hodinky did this for watches right watch blog for super high-end watches well guess what as soon as you start selling watches that business I think Kevin Rose came on this podcast and said it went from one or two million a year in Revenue to 100 million when they flipped that switch and started actually selling the watches that they had been talking about for 15 20 years and um so content to Commerce is this kind of like really interesting play and I think that uh this is a great example of it being done well yeah look you have BuzzFeed doing it with stuffed animals which is pretty lame you know they did it with with houses and this is baller uh Craig told me about this about a year and a half ago and I was like this is very bold and he was explaining it to me and he was very confident and it was like no big deal and I was thinking about this and I was like I don't know this kind of seems like a really big deal to me we should do well I was like I don't think you're gonna be able to pull this off well I didn't say that but in my head I was like this is ridiculous he totally did they totally pulled it off we um we did this way back in the day I think you would said something you were like ads are lame or this before HubSpot bought the podcast so it was basically like ads are lame we're selling ads for the podcast but like what would be a better business for for my first million to do and I think at the time people were like you should create like a wework like a branded version of wework or like a white label like uh co-working space or something like that which sounded crazy but I actually think that there was a version of that that that's as true like basically if we just bought like a eight unit or 16 unit apartment building um in San Francisco but it was only you could only go rent there if you were part of our community or you could buy units there it would be part of our community something like that could work uh because people would rather live in a community of like-minded people than a community of absolute strangers I think there's a huge number of people that would do that and so then you get into the real estate game these units in San Francisco go for you know a million and a half two million dollars on average you know they so so you could do these things where you you know in theory every a brand like ours could also do that and say yeah if you want to be around other entrepreneurs other business people who are you know share this kind of like this ethos that we have then uh you know you could do that but there's a problem which is you and I I don't know about you me I wasn't even bold enough till I consider that I thought that was stupid now I've got a little bit more experience and I kind of understand like our pull a little bit now I actually think that that could work but at the time I was like that's ridiculous there's there's no way that would work dude my brain is like a metal detector that's just looking for something that's going to scare me to do I'm just like where can I get the maximum thrill the business thrill like we're gonna get the maximum reward plus I'm down with the risk and saying that like if I said out loud that I was doing this that I think would get other people's attention but it would also make me a little scared because I don't know exactly how to do it like I am very attracted to these ideas and there's that's not always a good thing I think that's a bad thing in many cases but uh but I'm I hear that and I want to run into that fire a little bit whereas I think you hear that you're like there's a fire why would I run no no no no no now now I'm more comfortable because I've seen some I've seen like well if you do this this and this the odds of some type of uh return is is positive but like before I was still kind of understanding like that mechanics of business and like investing and things like that now I actually do see it we're like the Opposites uh we're like the opposite I get excited by that weird kind of like kind of half figured out thing and you're like well why don't you know I want to figure it out first but then once you do figure it out you're like you're like go and you just execute and you're like locked in and you just you just freaking go on that opportunity whereas I'm like oh this is cool and it's kind of figured out all right cool um like I'll kind of go there but oh there's this other interesting thing over here that's like you know I figured out and I I'm not as good at the lock-in you get bored after you figured out the puzzle exactly yeah exactly for me I have to figure out a little bit more and like I want like a higher certainty that the puzzle pieces are even gonna be able to fit together you know what I'm saying right right exactly um but then once the puzzle's done you're you're like my puzzle I love this puzzle dude this is my puzzle I'll tell you an example so uh Sean and I are going to Vancouver Wednesday I think and we're doing this little uh meet up with us and Andrew Wilkinson and this wasn't even that well organized like they've done a good job of it but like there's no Maybe not maybe it well organized isn't the right word because that sounds insulting it was just kind of low-key like we just have like a type form that you have to sign up for and that's it and then you pay 50 bucks to show up and I think you get a refund if you show up I think they're doing it to like guarantee seats like the people listening to the Pod if they say how do I sign up I don't even know where to I don't know where to go uh we're doing a meet up but it's in stealth mode for no reason I don't know I don't know what the organizer guys doing but it doesn't make any sense to me it doesn't make any sense to me yo um what's the venue and date and time oh man we're it's all coming together we're working on it it's like yeah I don't know I don't know this fire Festival what's happening here and then he they refunded the money and I'm like well I could have used that money on like my flights and hotel I wish I wish you know like I'm paying money to go and do this it would have been cool because like the thing it made like 50 or 100 Grand I'm like you know give me like 3 000 to pay for my stuff but uh when I when I kind of like realized that we were able to pull off some of this stuff I'm like oh hey we can get people the the thing with media what is if you can get people to buy [ __ ] or leave your home so like if you say I'm gonna be at this location at this time the if you were able to get people to do that that means you have pull and once every once in a while when we pull that off then I'm like oh we could have pulled this off something like this or we still could we still can and then I I I I start to believe it yeah that's interesting actually that's a good metric because um I've been trying to think about on the content side I'm like you know I want to set a goal because I think uh I work better when I have a goal you have to give context the context is Sean is now he's considering or planning or doing to go harder on creating content yeah yeah exactly uh sounds lame so don't even say those words content creator sounds like lame I'm gonna come up with my own words but like yeah the idea is hey I like doing this thing where I get to just like learn about stuff talk about it and people seem to like it podcast is one version of that the newsletter is another version Etc and um anyways the point is I was like what's a what's a good goal for this and I was like oh a million uh 10 million subscribers fans no what do I want here and I was like and then I was like intuitively there's something more like um that Kevin Kelly thing the true fans thousand true fans where it's like uh he wrote this blog post that's amazing that's called a thousand true fans basically says if you can have if you can have a thousand true fans a true fan being somebody who would pay a hundred dollars across the course of a year they'll buy your shirt they'll show up you know for your event they'll buy your tickets they'll do whatever because they really like your stuff and like you know for an artist if you're somebody who's just creating a thousand people who are willing to pay a hundred bucks sounds kind of achievable it doesn't that's not like I'm gonna be the next you know Justin Bieber or whatever um and it's a hundred grand and like you could make a living doing what you love if you get to that point that was like one of the original things that I think inspired a lot of content creators online and um I was like oh maybe something like true fans but how do you measure a true fan I guess it's this hundred dollar spend thing but I think this thing you're saying is actually true which is uh it's like a test it's like if I just tweeted hey I'm hanging out at this coffee shop right now in San Francisco how many people would show up and like I think three years ago that answer was zero to zero to two you know like maybe just my actual friends who I hadn't caught up with in a while um you know now I don't know what that number would be but probably what do you think if I did that no idea well if you know thousands would be crazy but if I was like no hang out here all day so it's not like if you came into that window if you gave it a two-week window or a two-week notice a two to four week notice I think you know I'm saying same day I'm just I'm gonna be here all day swing by if you're around 50 to 100 I bet 5200 yeah exactly and I think that there's a that's probably that's great that's that's amazing there's some point where it's like uh the coffee Shop's like what the [ __ ] is happening uh there's like there's too many people here guys what what is this there's some point where you break the coffee shop and I'm like okay there's some way of testing that because I think what most people go is for reach and they get really tricked by these platforms that are like yeah your video got 95 000 views and it's like cool um how many of them actually watch this versus just swiped by it or if they want like do how many of those 95 000 people know your name how many of them know anything about you how many of them care about you right like and so I think what most people do is they they just take what they're fed and they're fed basically the most large vanity useless number and I think for any business you want to find not the vanity metric but the true metric that actually shows um like the level of Engagement you have the level of love that your product has and so um and different business different companies have like different ways of looking at this like Facebook back in the day one of their metrics that mattered was they were like yeah of all of our signups 50 of them use this every day and that became this thing that was like okay it's not that they have the most signups like Myspace has way more but man this Facebook thing like have to use half of the total signups are using it every single day that's gotta mean something and the people that were able to identify that inside the company and as investors got mega mega Rich whereas other people were just chasing like a total user count number but they didn't really like have a good way to measure it so I think there's something to like finding the real metric that matters at the hustle what did you guys use because you could have just said subscribers right but that wasn't like quite the that wasn't just the thing like do you have any examples of finding the real metric that matters dude I we we would just do replies and so every once in a while I would purposely either write about something that was a bit controversial or I would purposely have typos and I would just see how many people reply and say that they saw a typo or at the very bottom of the email and I told you to do this and I think you did do it I would say um where where what city are you in right now send me is or I would say um I'm working from this brand new desk it's called this I love it take take a picture of your workspace let me see it and it would be just how many people are going to take a picture and reply back to the email and there was a time where at the very bottom of the email we said we're gonna send out stickers to everyone that replies and we got like 10 000 replies so we had to like mail at 10 000 stickers and so we would do little things like that where and this we got like 10 000 replies on like a hundred thousand subscribers and so I remember like anytime we get a reply from an email that's a that's a really good sign right and like I see this all the time with newsletters now because substack has this feature where if you subscribe to one newsletter like I read something I'm like yeah I like this I subscribe it pops up this full screen thing which is just like Sean recommends these five newsletters and there's only one button and you're just like uh okay next if you hit that and now you're subscribed five newsletters and you can see people on substack they're like wow my new my growth is crazy I'm hitting 100 000 than 200 thousand three hundred thousand dollars dude it's all [ __ ] and substance like this is awesome when they're showing this I'm sure in their investor presentation look at this now we drive the majority of subscriber growth for our newsletters there's a network effect here it's like no it's not a network effect it's a giant screen where people click next like I used to do this with our mobile apps it's like oh if I want to if I want this app to grow let me just pop up a screen where it's your entire contact list everybody pre-checked there's one big button that says next and there's a tiny black X that's like hidden in the top left corner if you could see that you're gonna skip it and like everybody wants to skip it but two out of two out of every 10 people are just going fast and they're just gonna hit the button and they just spammed all of their contacts and guess what my app goes viral is it really viral are they sharing it because they like this product no they're sharing it because I tricked them into spamming basically and substack does the same thing they basically trick people into subscribing to these newsletters in my opinion they I'm sure they would disagree and say no no no people just really want to be referred Five News newsletters every time they've subscribe to one I I don't believe that for a second um this happens with podcasts there's a very popular business podcast I like the guy but I think his numbers are BS it's uh you know should I say the name I don't know if I should say the name but like do it uh let's just say it's not a 30 minute VC it's a little less than that I'll leave it to you actually no he's a he's a great guy and he's done a great job building his podcast up but he'll tweet out these things where he'll be like 2 million two million people listen to last week's episode with this person and I'm just like dude there's just no way in hell that's Joe Rogan numbers that's there's not two million people I know we we we have a podcast I can see where we are in the ranks I can see where he is in the ranks I know other easy reviews the charts you can look at the views you can just see the cult following of certain things like if you said you know the all-in podcast is getting a million views per episode I'd be like I think that's true I think that they they really tapped into something yeah you could see the YouTube numbers you could you could think about where where the podcast charges I think it's doing at least a million probably closer to two per episode they do once a week it's super high quality it's got a broad appeal the numbers the data matches up to that signal um but when you're like oh dude yeah I get 2 million per episode for my super you know my talk with the third least well-known partner at this fund I'm just like there's no no chance and I think I even asked him once I was like dude how are you getting these numbers that sounds like off the charts for what like a a business or Tech podcast of of this you know size could do and he's like oh yeah we have a big audience in Asia or wherever and I'm just like oh okay well I've been in the internet game long enough to know like like dude I bought my first 5 000 Twitter followers right like I I know that you could get a you can get any number by doing anything on the internet and it doesn't mean anything especially for something like podcasts which is like newsletter subscribers it's like the hardest thing ever you click once and now you're a a consumer of everything else like nobody could even measure on podcasting if anybody's actually listening to these things and so yeah I can go get a bunch of people to click subscribe one time and it will auto download my feed every time I release a new episode like there was a guy uh Nathan matka that was doing this too he was like we get this many downloads per month and I was like oh wow a couple million downloads a month that's pretty good huge yeah um what do you do and basically he was like and I I when I talked to him I was like he's like hey welcome to the show he's going like Hyper Speed five minutes the podcast was over and I was like this is a five minute episode he's like yeah sorry I gotta hop to the next one I was like how many of these you record in a day he's like I record eight of these a day and then we release like whatever who's on some crazy schedule and then I did the math and I was like oh he has like 7 000 subscribers but he just releases huge volume of Random episodes of these five minute episodes and so his total monthly number because podcast is just like you know if you just do downloads it just adds up all your episodes times your number of subscribers you can have a small number of subscribers and do a huge number of download a huge number of episodes and get a big download number and so people I think use these vanity metrics all the time and they're BS so I I'll bring this up because we're discussing it but I didn't research it fully but have you heard of uh parcast it's like my name but cast so parcast have you ever heard of that are you are you spinning off your own solo did the brand makeup band break up and you're doing your own episode I I wish I invented this so it's a guy named Max Cutler I think he's our age I think he's uh like 31 32 33. so this guy named Max Cutler created this thing called parcast and the whole idea of it is it's a podcast network but they um they only have a crime a true crime and I'm a weirdo you want to know what I listen to every night there's two podcasts I listen to every night the first one is just called serial killers so it it's a it's it's just a bunch of podcasts about serial killers I I can tell you all I gotta I got I got my fantasy uh League of serial killers you know with Ted buddy as the quarterback and then there's another one called you know it's it's this one's fitting for going to sleep it's called deathbed confessions so it's people who confess about a crime they did when they're dying so it's just nice it's the best so this guy started this and it's all scripted so it has like voice actors and it's all scripted stuff he bootstrapped this podcast company which is unheard of and he sold it to Spotify for 200 million dollars after only maybe five years and uh him and his dad owned the whole company his dad was in radio and so his dad was like a radio announcer or something like that and uh they are producing something like 30 or 40 podcasts a day like episodes and they're all highly produced stuff and it's amazing have you not heard of this uh heard of this business I've heard of this brand once before I didn't realize that they I didn't really I didn't know the business side of it I didn't know that they had bootstrapped it and sold it to Spotify but I really I like True Crime I don't know where to start just like so many True Crimes and a bad one is like such a waste of time but um yeah I've seen some of their shows because I go sometimes look in the browse section for for like you know a good True Crime dude so true crime if you go and look at so it's a good one of theirs if you look at I like serial killer serial killers do death bed confessions is awesome I'll send you a good death back confession one they're so awesome and True Crime it's uh if you go to the podcast uh app and you look at like what are the top episodes or shows it's always like 30 or 40 True Crime and which is it's mostly women who listen to it and it's all we and so like a dateline I told you about this Dateline from NBC which is a show that's been around for 20 or 30 years at this point it's still usually a top podcast every single week and so these True Crime folks they kill it and this guy bootstrapped this company um to a I think it was a hundred million cash and then a hundred another 100 million earn out all off of these True Crime podcasts he killed it it's a really interesting story I'm gonna have to I'll dive deep and do some better research on it but I was reading about it uh this weekend it's it's a pretty amazing outcome this guy had so I just read an article this might be maybe wrong or maybe you're wrong I don't know Spotify confirms it paid 56 million for podcasts or podcast sorry uh then maybe I got my numbers wrong I think it was 56 and then another like 75 outcome it was a nine figure uh uh another attention there was a retention according to the podcast Wikipedia which reads as if Matt Max Cutler the founder wrote it it's very like congratulatory uh it it says there's like a huge turnout yeah I don't know if I trust anyone that does True Crime by the way uh these guys are natural storytellers and like liars dude all right I've got an interesting thing to bring up this is a uh something that we talked about a while ago I think you brought this up in 2020 or 21 I forget right when we were recording in the original hustle office so do you remember that company crumble that you brought up yeah well first of all I love a good I told you so so I'm already I'm already glowing uh yeah dude crumble cookies crumble cookies so when you originally told me about it the story was something like these two brothers or two cousins launched this thing and for some reason in my head I'm thinking like a family like cooking making cookies in their like kitchen and they start this like pandemic thing and it gets popular and basically once a week they tweet out a new menu and may have a drop you know things that like typically Supreme does or like these but they're doing it with like outrageous flavored cookies well that's not entirely true they what is true is they do do these drops but it's a massive business and some sources are saying it's close to like 800 million a year in revenue and the reason I saw it was someone shared this on Twitter but basically over the last like couple months it's been growing and growing and growing and so the other day it was like the number fourth most downloaded app in the week and so they have an app and so their app now has 2.3 million ratings or reviews with like with the 4.9 average and what and right now they're opening brick and mortar and they're opening a new store every five days they have something like 730 stores at the moment it's one of the fastest growing chains in America and so these guys check listen to these numbers they have 800 000 followers on Twitter 3.4 on Instagram 6.5 on Tick Tock 1.2 on YouTube and they create these commercials every single week for a new cookie drop and it is crushing it these guys are killing it it's so fascinating I never in a million years thought this was going to work as big as it has but basically every Sunday at 6 PM they do like a new drop in their app just spikes and goes way up the charts and they are they're up there with like Uber Eats and all this stuff like that they're killing it and so I remember you brought this up and in my head I was like oh this is like a little like Mom and Pop it sounds cute like oh that's cute yeah like oh your aunt make cookies that's nice yeah no they're sharks they're killing it uh and so you called that pretty early on and uh now it's a franchise so here's like here's some stats in 201 uh the highest revenue store did something like 3.6 million other stores did uh the average was like 1.6 million the store with the highest net profit was 600 000 with the lowest being 33 000 with the average profit of being around 350 000 and um according to uh the founders Twitter they did over a billion dollars in revenue and you have to come up with 150 000 and then you can open up a franchise and they send you all this traffic via their you know their Instagram and their app super fascinating business yeah this uh I think in the franchise world this is like the hottest franchise right now is crumble cookie because they're just exploding and they're just super prop super popular right now I do feel like this is not like uh the most sustainable franchise like uh at one point in time wasn't like I think I feel like Froyo franchises were like growing like crazy like this I don't know if it was Pinkberry or whoever else like uh you know there's these waves where this becomes the the treat but like I don't know how many people are gonna like anything that's drop based there's a natural fatigue that sets in for the buyer and uh and there's like a vicious cycle like drops when everybody's into the drop get even more fun because it's like the hunt and you've either got it or you didn't get it and you feel special but as soon as that starts as soon as the drop fatigue starts to kick in and now oh notifications there but if I don't get it today I can go get it tomorrow like as soon as the scarcity is gone the drop like plummets in value and so I think that that's a a challenge for for something like this but I agree but look here's the deal I have a you and I have a friend who buys Broadband companies so Broadband companies are basically internet service providers and a lot of people who are listening in the city will have no idea what I'm talking about but where I have my country house I've got this Ranch way out in the country and if you live out in the country it's not like you're getting like Spectrum or Google or Warner or whatever the big service providers are in New York City you're getting like a small internet provider that you pay a hundred bucks a month for and they probably that company probably does 10 million in revenue and like 5 million in profit and you and I have a friend who goes out and buys these companies and everyone says to him well what about starlink yada yada and he was like yeah they'll they'll come eventually but like until then I'm making five million dollars a year in profit so right with uh with this cookie thing yeah maybe they'll Plateau but a billion a year is a nice Plateau I don't mind sitting in that Plateau for a while and that's kind of that's like how I feel whenever I hear some of these stories like it's not going to grow I'm like yeah that's cool sorry I couldn't hear you the money powder was spurring a little too loud in my ears that goes back to me if anybody asked me why I sold for 200 million you get in a slap like you know just don't ask don't ask us stupid questions dude and and the founder uh one of the cousins or one of the brothers they uh he previously worked in Tech and he had a Facebook app that got to like 120 million followers so these guys are like viral guys they know how to do this but interesting story yeah it looks like he was director of product at ancestry which is like one of the like uh it's just one of the gems of internet companies that's like really big but nobody knows anybody who's like works there or nobody nobody claims to use it even though it's like really really popular site and did a bunch of cool like viral things and like basically did a bunch of smart product stuff along the way to like make that business work dude ancestry's funny too because they're a utah-based company and they're founded by Mormons This Guy's first business first business byu.com you hear about this on his LinkedIn byu.com was a social network for Brigham Young University students we we grew the network to include Half the campus in a very short amount of time but was ultimately crushed by Facebook so he did this in 2005. I think Facebook launched 2004 and so basically he was doing the like you know the the Harvard social network he was doing that just on BYU's campus but like the Facebook wave you know swallowed it but that's you know you're putting that's pretty impressive you're landing on on the budding green right there if you're if you're creating a social network back in 2005 for college campuses like God damn you were close to being on to something you know like I'm not surprised that this guy ended up being really successful no it's a really fascinating story um but uh anyway what what where do you want to go you want to drive can can I can I oh yeah that story really quick Ben has a story so obviously you mentioned their Utah company so of course I know uh well so the story is uh this guy adds me from Utah State University uh looks like he's just graduating or about to graduate uh I have a bunch of mutual friends with him on LinkedIn so I was like okay I'll do this kid a favor I don't know what he wants so I click add and he immediately starts posting cringe like uh I'm starting this company it's gonna be huge and then he keeps posting stuff that's like I don't know how to describe it it's very um like Adam Grant or Dumber like business like did you know that you can increase your productivity by 20 by having a team off-site so we're having a hashtag team offside this weekend and uh I was just like who is this kid he says he's starting a Cookie Company what honestly when they open their first location I was like I'm amazed I didn't think this kid would ever actually get even a location open and uh and it was Sawyer the the founder the CEO of uh of crumble and uh this kid who just posted cringe to my LinkedIn timeline totally like breaks my frame I just always assumed that if you're that Mega cringe you won't win and now now I have to consider the possibility that every hashtag user could actually be a winner because I'm doing a blanket rule if you're a Mormon guy and you're telling me you're going to start a a cute cookie franchise I'm in I mean come on Mormon does Trump cringe so like if you're Mormon I have to I you know the checkbook's already out I'm just waiting to hear you know how many zeros I need to put my my number here but that's based on the idea so yeah you're right that that actually overwhelms the cringe part because it's like this guy's gonna sell he's gonna this person knows how to sell yeah the well that sucks Ben yeah you missed out on that one yeah I know I should have just hit him up and like oh this looks really cool but uh you know live and learn I can find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better [Music] um Sean I have a couple things what do you want to do um okay I have a quick little idea so I was watching the Super Bowl and um uh did you watch by the way uh uh uh I watched the halftime show yeah I watched it I watched no I uh I I watched like quarter three who I wanted to take you to figure out Rihanna was pregnant during the halftime show um you know it was one of those things where my wife loves her and like you know you don't want to be rude when you see a lady with a lump and you want to like you know and I'm not going first that's I'm not talking yeah yeah so I I had her go first then I asked but she was doing some pretty uh raunchy stuff as a pregnant lady right I mean that was like Oh I thought that was tame for Rihanna that's like that was PG dude I'm a Rihanna fan she's in my like top five like most beautiful women on earth I'm uh I'm on team Rihanna but when I thought she was pregnant I uh it was that was surprising I think she just had a kid too yeah that's yeah she just had to get like nine months ago I don't the math doesn't even make sense to me in my head whatever whatever I'm watching the football game and um one thing you notice if you're watching the game is that when the chiefs were scoring they were scoring with these like incredible plays where the guy was just going untouched into the end zone like dude what was that thing where they like well they did yeah like rig Around the Rosie and then they like run to the line that was crazy what is that but amazing that they tried it right like that is uh that was an awesome play so I was thinking about it and I was like but it did stand out they had the two or three touchdowns where it was just like brilliant play design right call and like totally worked and then you know I I've gone you know I love sports and I've watched tons of sports documentaries and shows like last chance you could just see the life of a coach and a coach is like a really specific character in my head like a football coach at a high school college or even Pro level is like it's the same type of dude in most cases and their life is football they live and breed this [ __ ] they're preparing all week for you know the Sunday game and then they start again the next week and they're just like they just live in this Playbook and the X's and O's they all have the same value system about toughness and grit and whatever and um and I was like oh this is another job that AI is going to replace because I was like this is this is an AI problem the problem of an offensive coordinator in the NFL which is basically what play should I call here to maximize you know my expected return and I think you can somebody's going to build AI that basically ingests a bunch of data that says in this situation third down and seven um you know maybe even take into account the teams and the talent you know equation this is the best play to run with the highest expected value it's basically like what Madden does when Madden suggests like yeah run this play but like yeah yeah that's a really good version of Madden now that we have like you know computers are geniuses and so um so I'm pretty sure that there's somebody's gonna build a uh basically like a play caller AI play caller that will help because these guys are you just look they're literally looking on a cheat sheet like you know like like it's a open book exam or whatever and it's like you can bring in one eight by eleven piece of paper and everyone's writing in like size two font to squeeze as many things as I can on it that's what these guys use when they're calling plays and it's like they have you know 10 seconds to pick the play this is just a job that computers are going to be better at and um it just reminds me of like how crazy AI is gonna be that like even these like total non-tech situations not even big markets but it's just going to be like when now when humans play against a computer at chess or or even you know go or poke or whatever where the computer is just so much better than the human that's what's gonna happen in this play calling situation it just kind of reminded me about man AI is going to be going to be nuts because it's going to take over all these things that you wouldn't really have expected or in the line of fire for AI is football as like you know there's obviously the famous Moneyball thing where he's like I don't care what who's a superstar who's not I'm just going to look at the math and we're just going to pick people off spreadsheets and then famously although I think this is highly exaggerated chamoth was like oh I'm gonna buy the Warriors and we're going to do that same thing with basketball so we're only going to shoot threes or whatever I don't pay attention but whatever their their stick is sorry I'm ruining this but yeah and I but the reason I have a feeling it's not true is I have a feeling none of that team and also like I think he said that though right uh I don't think so but um but uh other people just in basketball Daryl Mori famously was like the big you know proponent of this the reason why I don't believe that is I have a feeling like teams were always doing this like maybe it's one of those things where like um um like for example my favorite copywriter he was like I wrote These famous ads for the cat what's it called the Casio watch and he's like we talked about how we use space grade aluminum and crystal quartz to make this watch and he was like little do they know every watch does that like that's just like table Stakes like every single watch but I'm gonna explain it because I know that the audience doesn't know and so like you have a guy saying like look we use state-of-the-art technology and it's like an Excel sheet that like everyone else uses it's like yeah I guess it's state of the art but anyway we have a premium license to Microsoft Excel unlimited seats unlimited seats we do not use the trial but is football the same way where you could just follow the math so there's actually there's actually a great question there's a Daryl Mori went on that guy uh I forgot his name the invest invest like the best guy Patrick yeah he went on his spot actually it was a really really great podcast if you like sports and you like kind of business stuff it was it's kind of an amazing one he talks about like baseball is basically the almost like the perfect game for uh modeling like you could basically because it's like stationary it's like one pit one batter versus one pitcher and um and then you know like it's a like it's a contained problem is it whereas in basketball you got five guys on the on each team on the course you got 10 guys all moving around free form at any given time the ball is moving like crazy it's much harder to model but you can still model the impacts of like one player in these certain situations and so it's like the data thing has had a pretty big impact in basketball but less than it did in baseball baseball was like a math became a math equation basketball became more of a math equation than it was before but still it's never going to be perfect it's too come complex and high school there's too many variables to be to be perfectly modeled out or whatever um but still it was improved which is why you see like they'll post like uh 20 years ago here's what the shot chart looked like and it's just dots all over the the chords like as you kind of expect like people shoot from everywhere and it's like here's what it is in 2023 it's like people only shoot layups or threes because optimally like basically a three is worth you know whatever 150 more than a two but there's percentage difference of shooting it is only like you know you know five to seven percent worse than a two pointer or whatever so you know you get like way higher expected value for shooting a three so that's why all these teams shoot threes now or layups they've tried they tell their players don't shoot this in between shot because it's the wrong combo right um so things like that and then he's like football is going to be the hardest one to to game because you have 11 players on each side and On Any Given Play Everybody's moving in different directions and you can't really figure out like the net effects of this guy running in this Lane what did that cause this other guy to do you know it's much harder to do um but I think that's that's true at a like because the reason these general managers care is because they're trying to they're trying to like basically it's like a stock picker it's like they're trying to find undervalued assets so the way you do that is you say this player is not like yes his traditional stats look like this but his game impact is different because of whatever and so you're trying to figure out the value of the game but it's the game impact because of locker room stuff and Leadership or is it no no they're looking at just the on the court movement like you know in basketball for example there's an assist if I pass you the ball you score that's an assist but if I pass you the ball I've I've made the whole defense shift to me you pass it to the next guy you get the assist the stat sheet doesn't show that I actually was the one who created this whole play this opportunity by by caving in the defense so the stat sheets like the traditional statutes limited so what these guys have done is figure out like Advanced stats that like better better show an individual player's impact not including locker room stuff and he's saying football is even harder more players more movement more whatever less plays total uh so you have a smaller sample size but I think that this play calling thing is bigger bigger in football because in basketball you don't call many plays um but in football every play is called in by the coach and so if you can make the coach 20 more intelligent by suggesting a better play that's gonna like that's gonna shift the time you know the balance of power towards that that team because they're just gonna get that many more first downs of touchdowns so I think this is like I don't know it's kind of like really really Niche here but I think this is an example of how uh AI is going to touch a bunch of areas and kill a bunch of jobs you don't expect bar shop you got something yeah okay so last night the game was dictated on that terrible call that um you know the the Eagles Defender you know got called on like a pass interference that basically made uh ruin the game Chiefs win that should have been decided by AI ref like why are there not AI refs why is any call Up For Debate you know I agree well there are in some sports like in tennis they put a chip in the ball so like when the ball lands out you see they always like instantly cut to this like silhouette of the ball as I it was out or it was in and everybody's just like it's unarguable and why is that because they have a chip in the ball and a bunch of cameras that triangulate it so they can tell you exactly whatever dude but that's so boring well that's the problem because in baseball you would have been like oh great like the Umpire calls strikes by squatting behind the catcher and trying to like eyeball this like that's insane for this billion dollar sport like why why are they doing this and it turns out if you just used computer to pick that to like perfectly call pitches I guess the the reasoning must be at a band you've been been leaving might know better but there must be something where people preferred that their human had the like final say here versus because like the technology is there for a a computer to call balls and Strikes there's really no need for that umpire anymore I'm not romantic to the early part of the game I'm romantic to fist fights that's what I want and that's the best part about baseball is when like they get mad at each other I mean that's what I watch I don't watch any of that other crap I want to see them fight there's a demo I I sent this to Ben I'll show it to you there's a demo of because this there's actually a bigger problem fighting like dude how many fights like I don't know in the UFC fight this fight this weekend did you think the right guy won I thought he I thought the right guy won but people were me too but a lot of people did not people deny it's a big problem with like it's these three judges that are going to decide who won the fight and um and it's like how do you call it oh yeah how do you judge you know if this guy made the wrong facial expression it's like did he get hurt how am I assessing damage here whereas there's an AI demo of basically the like um like the the Striking tracker where it's like this guy did a left hook and it landed with this like with this level of of impact or this like clean like it was deflected partially there or a clean shot and they're like we should have basically like perfect tracking of the fight game but for you as a fan would you want that would you want the computer to basically say who won the fight or do you want these three old judges to to scribble a scorecard I want the three old judges because uh that's not a lot of fun I can't believe it a lot but here's why first of all when you watch WWF and W in like fake wrestling WWE is called now the best part is when they like hit the ref or they like distract them like sometimes they'll have like a hot girl come and distract him and he turns around and then like something bad happens and that's like the best part of the show is like when there's drama um but also um in UFC um they have a new thing where they measure uh aggression you know like who's like pushing who's pushing the plot um and I think they do that so it's more exciting and I don't know if you can entirely measure like aggression with uh AI but that's why I don't like it um but uh no I I I'm okay with having uh humans do it I think it makes it more exciting more exciting we're talking about it they're almost always like they're they're only ever in the conversation when they do it wrong right like it's never more exciting because man they really the refs really uh added to the to the fight there by by scoring it like they didn't they don't they don't add anything they only subtract when they screw it up uh I'm I'm surprised you don't want like the actual accurate uh score the only thing that I want I want them to tell me the scores of a fight in between rounds and have that be the official thing because I want I want the person to know when they're going into round three or round five that I'm down and if I don't knock this guy out the fight's over and so that would be the only change that I would want I want them to know the real score as it's going I got one more random topic let's do one more even though we're a little over time uh well if you're gonna do one more are you gonna do this guy this Ahmad that seems media all right go for it yeah it is kind of meaty but let's do like a fast version of it so uh so this guy amjad who's the founder of replit um which is an awesome company uh is he tweeted this out he goes you know um some of the biggest companies that were built Airbnb Uber Etc um were built because they took an underutilized asset and were able to get more utilization so for example Uber our Airbnb said well there's extra there's an extra bedroom in your house or extra rooms you have extra space today it's not doing anything but you could rent that out and we could actually have more rooms to stay in um and more options for a customer and that became Airbnb this multi-billion dollar company and Uber is the same way he goes what are some other underutilized assets I think this is a great you know framework for trying to figure out you know where where a Marketplace could be or where a uh um and I think people were doing this maybe five years ago seven years ago a lot more there was like a people realized this and started jumping on it and that's why you got Wag the Dog Walker app you know which becomes worth a billion dollars in Airbnb and then and a bunch of others um and I have some examples here but but what do you think about this framework and uh what examples stand out to you I think it's brilliant I see on here you have stay-at-home moms one of the best Com or one of my favorite companies that have been eyeing is called squared away and their whole Niche is uh virtual assistants and the virtual assistant is a military wife and that's like for some reason in my head I think they're gonna act a certain way which who knows if it's true but I think that's one of the best ways of like a quote and under underutilized asset I love that um but the problem is a lot of people like I knew a guy who started a thing where you could do it was like self-storage but in other people's garages right and I'm like dude this is the stupidest [ __ ] I've ever heard of and it was in fact really stupid and it completely didn't work um and so I think that a lot of people approach us poorly yeah I think the the there's a lot of things you can think of like I know uh another one that people have tried a bunch was like chefs so it's like oh why do you only order from restaurants like what if there's a lady who lives Three Doors Down that makes it amazing you know Thai red curry you could just order for her and she would get she you know she'd get revenue for her cooking skill and then she could deliver to you and it's closer and you know wouldn't just be limited to restaurants but it's like a operationally these businesses are usually absolutely brutal B there's like a whole bunch of like safety and quality concerns and like um uniformity of the quality concerns that that come up so I think that's that's another problem uh and then the economics like uh people do you know is there enough dollar value for there to be you know for the customer to pay the provider to get paid and the middleman to get paid and the delivery person to get paid like you need enough value in the chain which is why Airbnb works it's like a high ticket thing uh there's one for uh versus others and there's one for pools that I hear is killing it yeah yeah exactly share like rent a swimming pool by the hour right because I have a pool we're not using it 95 of the time so if somebody could rent it from us and we make a few hundred bucks yeah yeah that's great um I want to give you some of the best answers that came from the thread so the first the number one is cars so cars I think are parked like 93 or 95 of their time of the time and so once we have self-driving cars um that car shouldn't just stay parked it should go go be a taxi for somebody and earn you money so I think that's like one of the big unlocks that people you know people who know about this they're like oh yeah that's obvious and that's going to be a big deal but I would say the majority of the population doesn't realize that your car is going to turn into a worker for you um and people are going to just you're going to be earning Revenue when your car is idle instead of just sitting in your driver or your garage dude get around which I used to use all the time in San Francisco I think they raised almost a billion dollars in funding and they went public recently ish their market cap as of right now 59 million dollars so wow no one quiet has figured it out yet it looks like well that's a little different that's still rental cars this is going to be just like no get around to other people well yeah you're right you're right right so so uh it is what Tesla is basically betting on this is what elon's betting on he basically is like your car is going to go from a depreciate depreciating asset to a revenue generating asset for you which will make the car worth five times more than it is today um once it once it's able to just run all day for you and just go do rides okay that's that's bold but that'd be cool if it works out uh clean structured data so basically there's a bunch of data that in a bunch of different companies just sitting around and if you could kind of organize it and clean it up um that data is actually an asset that can be used and like we talked about earlier the freight waves company that's doing pricing data you know how many companies have pricing data about like what they bought recently how much it costs how what volume and from what provider if that was available in a structured way and you could sell that to a middle like a network like a data aggregator um you know that that becomes a valuable asset that today is worth zero to the company that has the data but it's not doing anything with it and it's not their main business to be able to do something so I thought that was kind of an interesting one um dude someone wrote the Sun yeah the Sun so they were like the sun is basically providing all this energy but until we have solar and batteries to capture it uh it's massively underutilized like we're getting free energy from this giant you know uh nuclear fusion reactor that's in the in the sky or whatever uh but you have to be able to capture it and store it and uh it's underutilized for that reason um another one I thought is kind of interesting uh so fun one nightclubs nightclubs are really like only useful like you know for like five percent a night time yeah you know at night on you know Thursday Friday Saturday or whatever um what can we do and they're usually in kind of prime real estate in cities and um I've always thought it was cool when I lived overseas in Indonesia they used to take nightclubs and during the day turn them into like Fitness day bars so you'd go in the dance floor and the mirrors would turn into basically like a cardio session and then the bar would turn into a smoothie bar and I was like oh this is so smart they're getting like double utility out of their nightclub um I don't know why I've never seen that in the United States for some reason um so I think nightclubs is a fun one and then another one that was on here was a specialist Talent so like what's that mean like think about somebody who's like a really great 3D animator or something like that so like if a company hires you that's great uh but I would actually say like you doing the thing you're world class at you're probably only doing like 10 to 15 of your time when you're in a big company um a lot of your time gets spent sort of like waiting for approvals or feedback or doing meetings or doing whatever other stuff that's around it there's probably a case to be made that like people with really specialist Talent you know Financial modeling or design or whatever they would be better off being freelance to companies but it would need to the market needs to be more liquid and fast-paced than it is today like um you you would need like like Naval has talked about this he says the future of work is basically like Ocean's 11. it's small teams of people that are within each team there's like highly specialized you know that guy's the the guy who's a pickpocket and this guy's the guy who can break codes and this guy's the guy who can do acrobatics whatever like the ocean is 11 that's what they do there's a highly talented Specialists they gang up together to go on this mission for a heist they then they split the money they go in their way they rest until they get the next call and he's like that's what and he's like that's what work is going to be it's going to be PODS of people that work well together highly specialized they're going to get a beep up they're going to wake up in the morning they're not gonna have a job they're gonna wake up in the morning and check their phone for possible missions they could go on they could choose to do none of them and just chill that day or take one because they're like oh that's a juicy Bounty they could go do that mission when they're done the employer rates them like like an Uber ride like five stars you rate the employer five stars the the money gets paid out to everybody's cell phone and you go on your way and you do you wait till the next job and I just thought that was a really sexy view of the future it hasn't happened quite yet but like you could see like I guess Uber kind of works like that and I guess there's like you know taskrabbit and these other things that kind of work like that and I guess freelancing is becoming more popular maybe this is maybe we are shooting in that direction I hate when people make these claims like this is the future of blank like if you say that like the Futures electric car yeah I buy that but if you say the future of work is like Ocean's 11 my reply to that is like no maybe the future of criminals is ocean 11. but like that's not like it's like the future of people getting money is to rob banks no maybe like a group of people will do that but I just don't think that like but why okay take the Ocean's 11 analogy out right like yeah that's leading you to bank because what's wrong with the actual premise because I think most people now it's like saying well most people are just gonna freelance no maybe 30 of America will but I think that 60 to 70 of America they want to go to work at nine they want to get off at four or five and they want to play softball that's what they want to do they don't want to like go on a heist where they like are having some exciting Mission they just want to clock in and clock out and do the same thing every day maybe we think that's cool maybe think our listeners think thinks it's cool but I think when Naval says something like that I think that he is in this small bubble and although he's smart and gets a lot of things right I think it's too grandiose to say this is the future of work and I think it's really dumb like when people say the future of media are the creators like doing XYZ I'm like oh my god dude like maybe that's like a new band that you're assembling but that's not like the that's not like how everyone's gonna operate I think you're just you like to smell your own farts so I don't like I I think you're just you're out of your you're out of your depth here that's that's what I think when I hear stuff like that yeah but I think uh nobody means 100 of people are going to do this when they say the future is X I think they mean like a lot certainly sounds that way yeah but no 100 people don't do anything today 100 people don't do nine to fives either so you know not even 80 of people do nine to five so I think that's kind of I think it's a given right that's like a it's a given but it's not sexy enough you can't say anything is the future if you say everybody's gonna do it there's still people who use AOL to get on the internet like yeah my mom you know like of course you can't say that everybody's gonna do it it's it's not a that's not a realistic thing but I think it is real to say uh shit's Gonna Change Trends are going to shift and you know huge chunks of the economy or the workforce is going to look different than it did today because this whole idea of go to a go to an office for a nine to five that's also kind of new and that was also a shift from what was before so I don't think that's like just ingrained in human that's not like biological that's not physics that's you know society and economics and a society so it tends to change it's not sexy enough to say the future of work is this group of people that's a nice small enough Niche that you can go and capture market share while also being big enough to support a multi-billion dollar company that can return Capital at a 55 annual return I get it that's not that's not as catchy it was a shorthand to the Future yeah but uh yeah that's cool uh I have some more topics that I'll say for later yeah but uh this was a good one all right that's the pod thank you [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
he paid 25k for the team it's now worth something between two and three billion [Music] so today's episode is going to make me incredibly uncomfortable because I know nothing about sports I was just informed yesterday when Sean texted me he said last night last night he goes let's do a special on the Super Bowl and it's this Sunday and so that's when I found out that the Super Bowl was this Sunday I know nothing at this point and how did you find out did I text you this yeah what do you mean you texted me and you said no I sent you a voice note I hate voice notes I'm not a fan of voice notes but you sent me that and that's when I learned it was the Super Bowl um I know nothing about this look I know what you're thinking you're like look you're this Macho Man you look like you're a descendant of Dennis the Menace you're the you're nobody says Macho Man since literally the Macho Man was a character in the 80s I know what you're thinking you're this All-American hunk you love sports and you're partially right I am American hunk but I know nothing about sports I don't pay attention to it all here's the problem in high school sam looked like a nerd and hung out with a nerd and developed nerd Hobbies but then Sam now looks like a jock I CKY but he still has the nerd Hobbies so you're the high school quarterback you're the varsity QB but you still like you know go under the bleachers and you know like smoke weed or whatever I don't know what what what what your like crew was doing um but but yeah you you fake you fake like sports I look like Napoleon Dynamite in high school there's no way that I was like I knew anything about sports I don't know anything about about sports so I'm gonna be what little clubs were you in um there was a history a history club that I that I took part in you and Ben Wilson yeah I participated in the sport track and field where I ended up getting a scholarship for for college and uh cross country I was a cross-country track and field guy I'm sorry I'm sorry I played the best sports a sport requires like a ball and you played you know you played things that just require moving a little faster than normal a slight increase in Pace I have said that I think exercise you should work out so you can either kill and eat everyone in the room or be able to outrun them therefore I only watch UFC boxing and running I'm just trying to I'm just trying to kill and eat and run away that's all I'm trying to do I'm not trying to like play with the freaking ball yeah you got fighter fight or flight uh as your hobby but anyways either way we're doing the Super Bowl episode and we're gonna do a little different so if you listen to this episode here's my prediction you listen to this episode I guarantee you I promise you at least three kind of like smart alec know-it-all comments when you're watching the Super Bowl with your family and friends on Sunday because we're just gonna give you a couple little tidbits that you're going to be able to say did you know or you know actually and um everybody will hate you but they'll have to admit that you knew some good [ __ ] so that's what you're gonna get out of this episode it's all the stuff around the Super Bowl um and that's where we're gonna start so Sam I know this was tough for you to do research what were you able to pull out did you have to First Look up the rules of the game or what I I kind of know the rules four downs six points and Three Points uh like when you called me you said Super Ball and I was like that's called the Super Bowl no you said the Super Bowl was this Sunday and I think I asked if the Lakers were in it um no I I researched the more interesting things which is the rich people who own the team that's the [ __ ] dude the best part about sports is watching basketball and trying to guess who the rich people are in the front row and Googling them and reading their Wikipedia that's the best part that's basically what I did yeah one of these people does not belong it's like oh here's a celebrity in the front row here's Jay-Z um oh this is 90 year old guy with a 30 year old wife oh let me take a wild guess at who this individual is and how they belong here that's significantly more interesting so let's start with the owners because I think that is the uh the interesting place to place to start so the the two so I went through I did this thing I was kind of like a little over the top but I went through it I created a spreadsheet um it's not done yet but I'm gonna have it done by the end of today because I just got like really into it last night uh of every owner of in the NFL and I basically have all these columns like did they inherit it are they self-made how much did they buy the team for what's it worth now what does that mean in terms of its annual appreciation for how long they've held it and there's a couple you know that was a pretty interesting process the two teams that are in this right they both of them were kind of like inherited wealth not self-made but the Chiefs owner's story is very interesting did you just check that one out oh I could tell you all about it I've known about them so basically the uh the Philly guy not interesting um yeah I mean basically the guy's Grandpa started a movie theater uh it expanded they bought other things and it's just like a nice story but not like particularly that interesting and now he was like uh the the guy who owns it now he was like a professional professor of social a social policy somewhere and then was like and I'd like to be rich I'm going to join the family business and join the family business and like you know I guess the most interesting thing was took out a loan against the company's assets to buy the Eagles for 185 billion dollars and it turned out to be a great great buy great great you know bet that he took so you know propsed him for that but this Chief story is kind of like uh like something from the wild west or like some so it is this is pretty that's exactly what it's from and this guy's really fascinating so the basically the grandson owns it but it all starts with the grandpa so in the early 1900s who gets the Billy of the week is it it's the grandpa right foreign [Music] [Applause] the grandpa yeah the guy who runs it now he's fine he just seems like a square he's just like a straight edge straight edge like nice CEO type but the the the the the the the the the founder the grandpa he's got the the perfect name so have you heard is it called The Wildcatter is that a band or a Wildcatter yeah that's that's a great name for what they used to do so basically in the early 1900s um his name's H.L hunt that was his name and if you Google him he looks like a crazy person so he almost looks like a the serial killer version of the Kentucky Fried Chicken Guy like he wears like a bow tie he's got like Colonel Sanders was on season four of you yeah if Colonel Sanders liked to drink uh Jack Daniels that's what this guy looks like he's got like piercing blue eyes and he's got like a like a shitty eating grin and he's a wild guy but basically he started uh he was born in the early 1900s and he was like a a high school dropout I don't even think he graduated elementary school but he was this kind of math genius type and he was yeah Math Prodigy and he was a gambler and basically he ran for ran away from home at the age of 15 uh drifted across the country doing odds and then like odd jobs eventually he had like 50 or 100 he gambles it playing poker turns it into a hundred thousand dollars which is something like three million dollars takes that money and he starts buying oil leases so um it's kind of almost challenging to understand today but in the early 1900s right when my cars were getting popular America was basically like the Middle East where we were finding all this cool uh all this oil here and so people were like buying plots of land in Ohio PA Texas in order to find oil well that's what this guy was doing he was trading oil leases and he was mildly successful but at the age of 36 he was like man this Oil Business sucks because I make a little money I risk it all sometimes I lose sometimes I win it's like I'm still gambling I want to out and so he sells all of his stuff and he goes fine I'll do one last thing with the with the money he has from selling his stuff he buys this plot of land in Texas and it turns out to be a lotto ticket where it's the largest oil Reserve ever discovered it's in Texas and 20 years later he becomes the richest man in the world but throughout all of this this guy's a crazy person he ends up having 15 kids with three different women some of them were totally degenerates the kids some of them like like up three or four of them died from like drugs a plane crash their crashed motorcycles crash cards they're just like these crazy kids but a few of them were awesome so one of his daughters started the Rosewood hotels have you heard of that yeah yeah that's famous yeah it's like a big thing another one uh Lamar which I think is the dad of the current CEO of the Chiefs uh he's like credited as uh naming the Super Bowl so like he was like pretty important in sports but this guy's crazy a few examples he was like he ends up being the richest man in the in America but he uh it was like the bad news here is he was like a crazy racist and he believed in like yeah he's like really racist and you put note here yeah there's a big footnote here so basically he would like there was a do you know how like um do you know how like amongst the black community in like the 50s and 60s like getting into Islam was like popular and they would wear like Muhammad Ali yeah yeah and that was all because of uh what's the guy's name Elijah Muhammad he like started this like um thing in America I don't know everything what it stood for but part of the thing was we need to take black Americans back to Africa to our homeland first of all shout out to history Club in high school look at this look at you it was reeling and wheeling and dealing with history right now keep going I know all about this I know a little bit about this because Elijah Muhammad was uh homies with Malcolm X and I I've read a lot about Malcolm X so anyway um part of like Elijah Muhammad's deal his shtick was like we want to separate the races and this H.L hunt this southern white guy was like Hey so do I that's awesome I also want to do that and so you know Elijah Muhammad was like you know we want to go back to Africa and have our own thing H.L hunt was like great I would like that so he funds that so you know he's definitely a little racist a lot racist he also is accused of being one of the conspiracy conspirators behind the killing of JFK this lady like at like a deathbed confession tells a story she's like I was in the room with Lyndon B Johnson an HL hunt where they said this bastard JFK after tomorrow he's no longer going to be on our back he's not going to embarrass anymore we're going to take care of this of course it was it's kind of nonsense but this guy had his hands and everything and he was this if you Google him he looks crazy not crazy in a bad way but like a wild man he looks like a degenerate a little bit and I don't know about you Sean do you know any of these like Southern Texas uh like entrepreneur types they they no not personally so I know a few of them I know this group of know this group of guys and they call themselves Capital men and they're just like they make a little that sounds powerful it's awesome right they're just like that sounds a little awesome yeah I'm gonna steal it I'm a captain ourselves we're just a couple of couple of capital men yeah what do you do I'm a capital guy basically like there's this whole like industry of these guys that have like the southern swoop and like that haircut and they got a little like wild in their eyes but they like are into like hedge funds and into like you know because a lot of them it's rooted in like buying and selling oil and being these like rough and tumble oil guys and then once you get big enough then it kind of like comes into like buying Futures and options to oil and then it's like oh let's do all this other stuff with money and start a hedge fund so there's this like it's like rooted in that but some of these Southern Rich entrepreneurs they have this like the thing about Silicon Valley Tech people is although they're smart and Rich they don't know how to spend their money and they don't know how to have fun and these usually my Southern friends that are like rich is successful they don't have that problem rich people at silica Valley call themselves Venture capitalists come on Capital men like God damn that that could mean anything that could mean I I could see that meaning politics I could see that meaning money I could see that meaning like we got we're the guys who got the money above the people who got money and it's like you know like we're the real Capital the capital guys it could also just be we're real men with a capital M I'm like I this could go in any direction and I am I am kind of interested in all of them this is fantastic and so so this guy's name HL hunt people who do that like initial initial cool last name like what's the name of that guy who did the that Big Heist and like jumped out of a plane DB Cooper baby yeah DB Cooper Rachel hunt like you threw a name like that at me like like God yeah like God damn I just need one of these names LL Cool Jay yeah hello Cool J man that was one of the old timers so to summarize this guy he's a wild man he there's two quotes that he's kind of credited with saying that like you and I have probably heard of the first is uh if you know how rich you are you aren't very rich I don't know if you ever heard anyone say that but that's like one of the things you ain't Rich yeah and that's and the second thing he said is money's just a way of keeping score so those are like two phrases that dude he also coined the term Super Bowl his son did yeah so it's like they're they also came up with the name and The Branding around the Super Bowl so that's pretty amazing he paid 25k for the team it's now worth something between two and three billion which is uh fantastic investment you know it did phenomenally well you know one thing that's really interesting both these guys uh so both these guys so he paid 25k it's now worth two let's say two and a half billion um the Eagles guy bought it for 185 million now worth also about let's say two and a half three billion um that sounds like this incredible return and it is for sure but put that into 10 a year what's that 10 a year so these teams average these seems that like you know you hear these crazy stories oh he bought the team for 200 Grand and now it's worth three billion dollars I said yeah but he did it 42 years ago or whatever and so the math on oh when I was calculating these for most of the teams it's just 15 to 20 annual appreciation compounding and it's like wow this is uh this is this is like you know Sam's way of life is just like right you give me 15 pounding you give me 15 a year I'm gonna get weak at the knees 15 that's your same word dude yeah just whisper in my ear 20 compounding and I found it was gonna collapse yeah that's uh that and it's just really remarkable to just see it kind of play out that way it's like because it's not this incredible hockey stick yeah like another Spike uh in value it's just a if you annualize it 15 to 20 a year for a long time and it shows you how Warren Buffett's so rich the guy's just been compounding 20 for like 60 years and uh that's how you get whatever 90 billion dollars something insane like that what year did they buy it um they bought it because I imagine there's a world where like back you know whatever year they bought it it was kind of like buying a soccer team now where it's like I don't know man it's like kind of got some traction but I don't know if this is gonna be part of like the the fabric of of society yeah yeah yeah you know like Dana White behind the UFC in 20 years we're like so we're just gonna get a bunch of big dumb gorillas in a cage and make them fight to the death and like it's gonna be a legit a legitimate sport you know what I mean yeah yeah so these guys are rich though they're worth like 15 billion dollars now so they're they're a very rich family um okay so let's do some other things now let's Zoom all the way in I got a little niche business that's kind of interesting so when I was thinking about football or think about the Super Bowl from like uh a business point of view you kind of it's a different lens you take a look at it from a different angle one of the things I noticed when I was watching the playoffs this year I was like dude all these things that I just take for granted because there's just a regular part of the game I'm like they didn't just happen that way somebody decided we're gonna do this right we're gonna sing the national anthem before every game and everybody's gonna stand up and they're gonna take off their hats with their hand on their hearts and we're gonna do this and then the Jets Are Gonna Fly Over the game and it's like why are these airplanes flying over the stadium I don't know if you've seen this like they do the flyover and it's like again these aren't just they didn't just happen to happen somebody somewhere in some room was like we're gonna do it this way and these things cost money to do and they take time to do so I'm like What's the strategy here and I read this article and it kind of said it well it goes the NFL has draped itself in the flag and um and it's so true basically like that from a branding point of view the NFL basically when you watch a game the Pomp and Circumstance makes you feel like this is a patriotic event we are all proud to be an American like that's like the like they they should just play that song at the beginning of the games in fact and so I was like where did each of these come from and so I started looking into it a couple crazy things one the military basically pays the NFL tens of millions of dollars per year to do this stuff because it's basically a giant recruiting event for the military so they they the flyover they have to do these anyways as like part of their training missions so they're like yeah it does cost you know uh between like you know 80k to 400k to do these flyovers but we have to do these as part of routine training anyways so why not do our training over the game so we get this visibility and we get this sort of like badass thing because if millions of people are gonna watch these games like the Super Bowl's watch by 100 million people um that's super positive branding it's a it's it's like co-benefits like what is that like parasitic relationship where it benefits both it's like the NFL gets this association with like true bravery courage patriotism America and the military gets like visibility with this like and because everybody sat down and watching and it's like a free commercial for them and so then I was like okay that's those are interesting what else it's kind of like it's kind of like when a white girl posts a picture on Twitter of her Pitbull and it's like who rescued who [Laughter] special for me today that is amazing that is the funniest thing you said in a long time wow I'm gonna ask you questions about that joke later because I'm so impressed by that joke dude that was great nice tattoo by the way you want to show this hat I don't know if you could Flash the tat on your leg Sam sends this Sam sends a text message and we will post this on the uh on the YouTube of the reveal so it's basically it's like uh like a napkin covering that whatever the tattoo is you can see there's a tattoo underneath if you don't know what it is and it's like wiping it and then it reveals Sam's dog's face a huge pit bulls facing out takes up his entire right leg and um and as that reveal was happening I was like I am prepared for this to be anything like this tattoo you could have convinced me it was 15 different things and I would have been like yep I guess that makes sense I guess that's what the decision was today like uh oh yeah it's a map of my favorite you know my favorite motorcycle Trail through the Midwest all right sure all right like uh this is my favorite brand of beef jerky cool no that's thigh yeah it's a portrait of Macho Man Randy Savage yep got it it's a slim jim like uh I just did I got the slim jim logo flowers but they're all just Slim Jims instead of flowers like all right artistic nice one um yeah dude so do you know um the best part about the whole America thing in um the Super Bowl my favorite one of my favorite videos and I'm I'm the type of guy I cried during the Star-Spangled Banner if it's a good one during this time it gets me worked up and there's this one I don't see how I kind of feel that too I I get worked up or at the metal ceremonies at the Olympics I always cry I always get worked up right um the 1991 version of The Star-Spangled Banger Banner with Whitney Houston it's like one of the best videos of all time have you seen that yes I've gone down these compilations Marvin Gaye at the NBA also won the Whitney Houston one's the best and it's so impactful that the Library of Congress they have this like compilation of like the 50 um greatest moments in American history and that Super Bowl thing that her performance made the list which is like a really big deal so this whole this partnership they've done a really good job of making it a thing and so now the NFL that's a beautiful line they've draped themselves in the American flag and by the way if you're like a band that's struggling to make it here's your hard pivot here's your sellout pivot just specialize in the Star-Spangled Banner and go perform an epic version of The Star-Spangled Banner and every college football game basketball game just go be like the best Wedding Singer the cover artist of the national anthem and just specialize in that have like the most badass performance of that because I think you know that's that's one way to not be a strong you know starving artist okay so here's uh here's another crazy thing you've seen at the beginning of the games they're gonna have this giant flag on Sunday and the flag is literally the size of the football field it is a massive massive flag again somebody makes that so your boy goes through and says who the hell makes this flag sure enough there's like one lady in Utah who is the like one of the biggest providers for this thing it's called 50 star Productions lady in Utah and she has one employee who hand sews this thing and he literally goes yeah I just do it in my basement I don't even come into the office so there's just a giant out dude if you leave these things if you Google 50 star Productions it comes up with a listing like her Google page is a picture of her garage yeah yeah exactly like I am pretty sure my friend this is his aunt because like it looks exactly like his aunt and like he has an Aunt Patty I'm pretty sure this is Patty so wow crazy thing but she specializes in she's like yeah I'm gonna just do this so she was like I'm gonna go for giant flags and it's not like she just was like you know some cute Old Lady Who Was knitting and somebody happened to be like oh I'll buy one from you no this is a business he was like she started off by buying the flags she would buy them for 40K and then she would rent them out for these events and like basically had a rental business then she's like all right these flags I'm buying they're low quality they have this big problem which is that they uh like if there's a giant gust of wind the flag turns into a huge sale like it's like a giant player takes the people up who are holding it exactly it's like James and the Giant Peach happens at the NFL game so they switched it what she does now is they um it's like actually like 15 different pieces that latch together to create the flag but when you zoom out you can't see that it's latched and so that makes it way easier to transport it adds a little airflow so that the that it doesn't make the people fly away or whatever and she rents these out for seven thousand seven seven thousand dollars per event and she does about a hundred thirty to 150 events per year she does about a million dollars in sales a year uh with her and one dude who's her Stitch Guy and um and that's their business and then she has like these two competitors super flag and this other guy that's like no no no our flags our flags are the [ __ ] and so they're like competing against each other to be the giant flag at all these games because now every game does this every football game does this basketball games do this um it is a is a like a random Niche that that she is like number one in and what a sick gig she probably gets to see all these stadiums go backstage and like walks by Beyonce when she's done singing the National Anthem I mean this is awesome this is yeah Beyonce said nice flag to her uh yeah she uh so she's my like this is my blue collar side hustle of the week because I just think this is like such a smart little thing and I also think that you could like somebody could compete with this I got a little idea here which is okay she fixed the airflow problem and making it smaller so that it's not like this giant heavy thing that you have to like transport in and out of the stadium but you still need 300 people standing around it to hold it taut so that it like because they can't put it on the floor can't fly can't touch the ground and um and so yeah for example why you need 300 people is it really just for that symbolic reason or is there I think you want to hold it so it's like straight it's like tight and so it looks good but then also it can't touch the ground as I learned dude I don't know if I told you this in my I have two embarrassing stories from elementary school one of them is uh I got assigned flag Duty on the ground when you're just put on the ground when I was working on the clip and then the person was like no no no no no no no and I was like what and they're like you can't touch the ground and I was like oh is this like a you know the floor is lava like are we playing imaginary games here and they were like we have to burn this flag now and I was like dude I'm already the only Brown kid in the school and now I have to burn the flag like Jesus this is not gonna look good for me at lunch today that's so funny I could see you like getting like holding it during the Pledge of Allegiance and then just not knowing what to do after just put it on there everybody was looking at me and I had no idea I was just fiddling with the clip trying to like figure it out and I was like what just what's the problem and it made no sense to me I was like okay look yes I did something wrong I guess but you guys are weird about this dude I think the symbolic stuff is a little funny I mean there's like people have American flags for like beach towels like you know what I mean like if it could like rub against your crotch we could set it on the ground sometimes yeah exactly exactly I can find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better [Music] some other things about the Super Bowl that I think are kind of crazy let's talk about ads so Super Bowl ads kind of get a lot of attention um there's a bunch of different ways we can go with this I have some stats I have some hot takes but I'm curious I want to hear your your take first on ads you have anything interesting on ads it's 6 million now is it six million seven seven million for 30 seconds plus it's the cost of actually filming it which is typically involves like getting Will Ferrell or something so that's like another million easily another million if you if you go that route yeah uh it seems worth it though like a coinbase did something cool it does I mean your internet traffic spikes right away what's interesting is the what I didn't realize when I was researching this is they test it a lot of times so they'll um release multiple YouTube videos early on and just see like what's the traction and then go with the winning one so that's kind of interesting but it actually seems worth it in a lot of cases so um so I did some math on this last year with the coinbase on so the coinbase one went nuts so if you don't remember last year coinbase did an ad that was pretty funny there's two two ads I think were really interesting ads that people have done so coinbase and AdWords just a full black screen so there's no branding on the screen and there was just a QR code that was bouncing around the screen like the old DVD like screensaver type thing where it would like you're kind of wanting it to land perfectly in the corner but it does never really does and they just had that on the screen for 30 seconds or a minute or something like that with with music it was just a flashing QR code and um and they came out and said that 20 million people visited the site uh in one minute as that was crazy uh it was actually kind of crazy so you can probably assume that maybe like a little bit more than that eventually you know came it crashed their app which was like unfortunate for them so you know uh it was so good that it crashed our app uh was kind of the thing and um I did some math on it and I think maybe it's hard to estimate the stuff because you don't know how many people are just gonna check it out and be like okay I'm not interested in signing up for crypto right now or like I already know what coinbase is so you gotta like discount but basically let's assume for a second 20 million people um go ahead and come to your site and you can assume some conversion rate so I don't know what you want to see convert three percent yeah even three percent is probably a little high but like one let's just say let's just say one percent so that's 200 000 people that sign up and then for something like coinbase they have to like link an account so let's say like you know another uh you know let's even save 20 of people link their account afterwards now you got forty thousand linked accounts but that's just during that kind of one minute time span but let's just start there their average user is worth 45 dollars to them per year um and so that's 1.8 million of like kind of like if these people perform like an average user so you get two million two million back out you've probably spent uh you know seven to six seven million total on the ad it doesn't work out great there but then you think it's year one there's all this PR about coinbase and people talk about the ad and blah blah blah things like that maybe the ltv's higher maybe it's a little lower because they're less than 10 I don't know I think it's pretty hard to break even I emailed somebody who um who was an investor in um hint hint water and during the Super Bowl a few years ago hint bought an ad last minute and they emailed out to their investors they're like yo by the way check it out I remember we bought an ad and so I asked him I said can you share uh like like what did they say if it worked or if it was good here's what they said for what it's worth they said it was great in so many ways we got 70 of the country because they bought like not the whole nation do you want like you know three of the top markets they go you know the normal price would have been about five million we got it for one million so we got a huge discount because we got a last minute buy um they say uh you know you never know uh they go when you buy that way you don't know when you're gonna end up we ended up right before halftime which is a golden spot um direct to Consumer numbers were good but not off the charts um on in terms of sales traffic was off the charts and then it's like yeah but it builds awareness and then my employees loved it they were like oh wow your friends are texting you saying I saw your guys Super Bowl ad um you know overall you know it was great experience and I think that's the the thing is it's kind of a hand wavy it's kind of a hand wavy thing the top advertisers are always you know cars beer snacks and then Finance stuff and um you know those are the categories that I think take off now did you ever see the Reddit ad from a while back I thought this one was awesome so what Reddit did was they bought somehow a five second ad in the Super Bowl so it just flashed on the screen and it was just an image with text it looked like a Reddit post and it was a Reddit post from this subreddit which I don't know if you've ever seen called superb owl no it's the same spelling as Super Bowl but somebody had created it on Reddit and it was like oh yeah this is a Reddit for superb owls like fantastic owls and so if you go there it's just pictures of Majestic owls dope owls and it gets all this traffic during Super Bowl weekend because it's r Super Bowl um and so they they put up this email Super Bowl I get it yeah and so I can share this this image but I'll read you what they what they wrote but it was really smart they go wow this actually worked if you're reading this this it means our bet paid off these big game spots are expensive we couldn't buy a full one so we spent our entire Year's marketing Budget on five seconds of air time one thing we learned is that our from our communities is that underdogs can accomplish anything with they come come together around a common idea so who knows maybe you'll be the reason that Finance textbooks have to add a chapter on 10 days maybe you'll go to superbal and teach about the and learn about the Majesty of owls maybe it'll pause this five second ad and take a screenshot uh powerful things happen when people rally around things they really care about and there's a place for that it's called Reddit and so really smart that they kind of flash something people like what was that and then it goes viral on social media as like oh that was a really smart thing really cool here's what that text said and so they saw this like traffic you know whatever some crazy traffic Spike but here's what's what's weird coinbase had said uh they kind of released this article like bragging about it they were like our downloads were up 300 over last week and I was like 300 it was like 287 I was like 287 that's it you just spent millions of dollars on an ad push with 100 million people watching and you only tripled your downloads from the previous week when nothing was going on that seems like really weak to me but everybody all the news articles promote that as like incredibly successful campaign and I'm like that to me that needs to be like 20x 30X 50 yeah last year this was last year when like there was a bull market and like coinbase was already one of the top finance apps in the country no it jumped from ranked 168th in the App Store to number one and I was like how is that I don't even understand how these numbers work so something might be wrong in these numbers it doesn't make a lot of sense um I think it's not worth it what's crazy by the way there's about 40 to 50 minutes of ads in the Super Bowl and the game's only 60 Minutes long so the ad load on the Super Bowl is crazy it's like 40 to 50 percent of the entire show is ADS so if you compare that to like I think a TV um ad load is about 15 so 15 in an hour you're gonna see 15 minutes of ads um for this you know in an hour of game time you're gonna see you know for every hour of game time you're seeing 40 to 50 minutes of ads which is kind of insane um YouTube for example is three minutes of ads for every hour of video that you're gonna watch just to show you like as a comparison how those things go uh which is pretty pretty wild um yeah a couple I don't know a couple other things on ads real quick uh okay so here's here's my other part that I think is is good on that there's a bunch of ads that are not commercials and um basically there's ad inventory that's not commercials so have you ever seen uh you know like at the end of the game they do the Gatorade bath where they they dump Gatorade on the winning coach so that just happened organically that wasn't like a paid stunt um but Gatorade was like oh my God jackpot and so every year that happens now Gatorade doesn't have to pay for it and they basically get 10 seconds of like a native ad of Gatorade in the winning moment like right when the team is like you know it's the peak of the peak they're they're about to win it's confirmed and Gatorade gets on the screen every single time to me that's actually the best ad in the Super Bowl because of how it's done it's zero cost and they get everybody to watch that thing right when it happens but they don't pay now they don't pay their Court well they're sponsors they don't even sponsor the the game are they sponsored just like the NFL in general to have that can there but they don't sponsor they don't pay anything extra for that moment the better thing is the you ever seen the thing where the at the end they interview the quarterback you just won the Super Bowl what are you yeah I'm going to Disneyland I'm going to Disney World do you know the backstory of this no it's pretty cool it's pretty cool so Michael Eisner who is the CEO of Disney he's at a dinner with George Lucas the creator of Star Wars and it's Tim it's George Lucas and it's some couple that had just completed like the the first round the world flight by uh by a person like non-stop around the world flight and so they're all at dinner and the food's taking a little time to come so there's some dead time here and and eisner's like okay well what a bunch of great stories that that table would have that's right but for some reason there was a lull and I thought so what do you do he goes he goes well now that you've accomplished the Pinnacle of your aspirations what could you possibly do next and um and they go well we're going to Disney World and they all started laughing and you know he's the CEO of Disney and he's like yeah he's like that's a great answer and his wife goes that should be your slogan and he thinks about that and the Super Bowl was coming up I think a couple weeks later so they call up the Agents of the two quarterbacks that are playing in the game John Elway and they say hey we'd like to make you an offer which is that at the end of the game when they say how does it feel what are you gonna do you know like uh you know they ask you that question we want you to say we're going to Disney World and um he's like we'll pay you 75 000 and we'll give you a free trip to Disney World if you do this he offers both both the guys the same deal what year what year this is 85 I think something like that okay or maybe oh 87. okay so Phil uh so Phil Sims ends up being the winning quarterback he uh and he at the time he was like telling his agent he's like no I don't even think about this [ __ ] no like this seems like bad luck to start planning my my Victory celebration and his agent's like dude come on like 75 grand like that was a big deal back then he's like uh he's like you know this is a great bonus for you all you gotta do is say this one line if you win uh what's it to you you know and your whole family they'll take you out to Disneyland Disney World no problem and so there's this amazing clip we can put the clip in the YouTube video but it's a um it's a link to this uh I'll put it in here anyways you can see it but it's basically the he's like running away from the field and he turns back it like looks like it's from a movie basically and the reporter's like you know what are you gonna do now and he goes I'm going to Disney World or we're going to Disney World and he says that became the thing and so then every year Disney would approach the whoever they think might get the interview at the end and they offer them the deal and they say hey whether you win or lose you're gonna get this money uh but if you are the winner we want you to say this and um so they pay the loser and they pay the winner and the winners got to say it and now it's become such a thing that Patrick Mahomes one of the quarterbacks who's in this year's Super Bowl just says it probably he tweeted out like years ago he goes man it must be the best feeling to be that quarterback who gets to say we're going to Disney World I can't wait and it's like wow that's the problem great marketing right and and it's also is a it's awesome and B it's painful everything that I think is this is it's like learning that Santa nothing's real bro yeah it's all fake uh that's wild it's all fake it's all nonsense but that's awesome that's crazy what what a smart move that's a really wise move and so I have um I have prepared for you you know we have our drunk ideas uh podcast which uh which we should do another edition of drunk ideas where I pitch you you know half-baked bat you know kind of bad ideas that you'd only think are good when you're drunk I have a new edition called drunk CMO so now I'm the drunk CMO and these are my drunk idea my drunk marketing ideas for you I want you to just rate them uh uh you know great you know okay or terrible um okay so here's my first idea uh I'm the drunk CMO I come into you I say hey boss I got an idea for the Super Bowl you say great or bad I say let me hear your idea yeah go ahead whatever I'm here right here all right so here's the deal somebody's gonna score a touchdown and all eyes are on them it's a celebration moment if you know players in the NFL if they celebrate too much if they dance they get fined like twenty thousand dollars fifty thousand dollars here's what we're gonna do we're gonna go to all the wide receivers and we're gonna tell them look not only will we pay your fine we're gonna triple whatever you get fined you get to keep that but here's what you got to do you're you're gonna have a branded celebration so uh I don't know what our brand is let's say we're a beer brand you're gonna run to this we have a fat guy in the in the seats right next to the end zone you're gonna crack open a cold one and you're gonna chug that baby pour that on your face you're just gonna do a chewy right there on the spot it's gonna go crazy viral you're gonna be seen as Mr fun as like you know this epic badass and we're gonna get our product placed in that great idea you know depending on whatever our product is you know if we're dude wipes you're gonna go take this and you're gonna take this wipe and you're gonna wipe you know right there right here whatever our product is you're slim jim you're gonna snap open a slim jim um that's the idea we're going to Brand the Super Bowl celebration what do you say how about that a great idea I mean so I don't pay attention to sports the things that I remember is the Rams doing the what was their thing called the where they would like uh you know like when they would celebrate the dirty bird I thought it was the St Louis Rams where I'm from they would like do like the the Huddle where they would do their stupid thing and then also Randy Moss pulling out uh Sharpie and signing the ball and throwing it out these are like iconic moments I'm on board with this this is all so whatever the brand is I'm going to those guys I'm saying hey we haven't we bought seats in the end zone you just gotta go grab the thing from this guy and do the do the celebration we got you and okay here's the next one hey boss uh I know Taco sales are down for us this year uh but I got a big idea I could save us I could save us here in the fourth in in the quarter uh our earnings are coming up earnings Hall's coming up Taco sales are down stay with me boss tacos for tails during the coin flip if it's Tails everybody gets a free Taco anybody can go there and just say tails at the window and get one free Taco everybody's now rooting it's not 50 50 baby we're gonna have the power of America on our side rooting for Tails we're gonna take that moment of the game and we're going to turn it into a marketing moment dude I would say Drake more often these are great when I was a kid when I was a kid they had Big Mac land you know the Cardinals we had Mark McGuire and if when he was on his home run thing if he hit his home run in a certain section you gotta be everyone in the stadium got a Big Mac and so his Big Mac land was like the section it was awesome I loved it and whenever he hit a home run in that section they would have the spotlights over McDonald's so everyone knew we got to run to Big Macland uh yeah in also awesome all right Taco for Tails tacos for Tails you're in dude if anything is alliterative like that I'm automatically in I love two T's okay so here's another one um hey boss uh you know that car companies like us uh we spend the most on Super Bowl ads right but we don't get the budget who's got the budget for that kind of thing where are we gonna spend 20 million dollars this year on Super Bowl ads for our car um what are we Kia yeah yeah or Kia and so you know what are we gonna do here 's what we're gonna do I don't know if you noticed boss but this is this new trend of when players arrive for the game the cameras kind of show them walking out with their outfit as they're walking in with their Beats by Dre headphones or their briefcase and they're like coming in for the job and it's like in the pre-game there's no there's just they're trying to fill time so that oh Patrick Mahomes is here look at him he's entering the building wait a minute this whole entering the building thing say it with me boss marketing moment why don't we put them in baller cars that are just tricked out beyond belief and they're gonna we're gonna film the actual arrival at the stadium and I think actually it's Rolls Royce who should do this but they should the Rolls-Royce needs to transport everybody in badass rolls royces to the stadium and the quarterbacks get the best whatever the Phantom triple whatever this is for a luxury brand Lamborghini whoever it is you gotta you gotta get the players to show up in style because TV will pick that up of them showing up there needs to be a freaking fog machine and it just needs to look crazy and so we're branding that moment and actually I got my buddies here from Louis Vuitton they're also gonna just put just drip everybody's outfit out because this now this entrance is a red carpet entrance and we're gonna we're gonna own that red carpet entrance from from the moment they arrive at the stadium what do you think look the thing about classy is you can't try too hard and now you're trying too hard that's not unless we're talking about like what do I want a souped up Acura I mean like what are we gonna do here like like I've learned enough like I've seen enough Hummer limos in my life I don't think you can make those things cool I'm out all right boss uh listen I don't know I don't know if it's uh if it's me I don't know if it's my allergies I don't know if I've been drinking too much but I'm just I'm stumped on ideas here I just I just can't I'm a writer's block I just got no ideas so here's what we're gonna do we're gonna go name Mr Beast our temporary CMO for the weekend and we're going to give Mr Beast our entire budget and we're going to say Mr Beast you take our 10 million dollar Super Bowl budget and you do a video on your own you come up with your own Super Bowl marketing campaign that is different than whatever's going to be in the Super Bowl this guy gets 100 million views per video and people love them and he's not just it's gonna stand out we're gonna instead what we're gonna do actually here's what we're gonna do we're gonna buy airtime the kind of like the the 15 second or 30 second ad slot and it's just going to tell people to go watch Mr BEAST's video um or it's gonna be Mr Beast on the screen and he's going to be clicking upload and then you have to go to his channel to see what the actual video is what do you think boss I'm out I'm out dog too many steps that's too you're getting too creative for me you're trying to win an award not make me money I do like the awards as a CMO I kind of build my whole reputation not on dudes but on industry Awards peers if I hear a marketing person brag about an award I'm automatically out I cannot stand those types of people really funny it's an award idea with the coinbase thing so they were getting a bunch of props for their ad do you remember what happened last year when the coinbase CEO came out and was just like people have been asking so here's the backstory around the ad yeah you made up this whole story he said this whole story where he was like you know we just wanted something cool everything seemed so cliche we got all these pictures from ad agencies about celebrities I never he's like side note I don't even understand why people would buy a product because of celebrities test I've never made sense to me and he just lost programmers going to say dunked on he was just someone was just tossing up the basketball and this woman comes in and just dunks him right in his face and so he's like you know the team came up with this idea it required no budget it delivered this epic return because it was so different no agency would have ever thought about this and this woman comes in and she goes except an agency did think about this my agency we presented it to you on 813 slide 19 is our is our idea for this and then people and then all the Ad Agency people were like get him they were like we never get respect and so they all were like this is about client agency respect and they made it like a bigger deal like they try to create like a BLM movement but for agencies and it just didn't catch on but like people tried and then he had to come back and be like but the the weak move so so all of it was fine I actually have no problem with any of it up till this point uh whatever he said I have no problem with what she did cool great great move on her part too the small boy stuff was at the end he comes back and he goes oh I I'm so sorry the team was working together so well with the agency I just thought it was all one team the the collaboration was so good that it just seemed like it was all our own internal team they were so integrated bro that's like me said that's like I walked in on my sister once when she my mom was like go tell your sister to study and I walked in and she was sleeping and I go mom she's sleeping she goes I'm not sleeping I'm reviewing in my head and I go oh she's studying in her head it's like the world's worst excuse was I the team was so so cohesive I just thought it was us yeah that's why you didn't give credit dude I like that guy Brian I'm a big fan of his he got dunked on there he that was a that was a that was a loss on that on his part that's the only like big loss I've seen him have a few else but we all take our L's right we got yeah we got a pocket full of else um all right here's here's another one um uh let's see okay so now the ad concept itself if you had to create an ad that you think would work what would you do to make a good ad for the Super Bowl oh man I'd probably just make a bunch of them and just run them on Tick Tock or YouTube and see which one is doing okay and just do whatever that one is yes that's like good testing but like um what do you think would actually make a good ad board make an ad that actually gets people to convert Matt Damon three strategies yeah epic story Matt Damon or what I think is I think what somebody should do this is not allowed because they reject these ideas but I think you got to create some drama so I think you want to have a sort of like a will it or won't it moment and so like you know I want to see a mouse in a tank with a snake and there's just tension it's like what's gonna happen here and there's like one safe place the mouse can go and it's like this is AAA ad and it's brought to you by AAA it's like it's the mouse gonna what's gonna happen to this map there's a man in a box and he needs your help that's the premise let's go let's riff off of that yeah I think you gotta have some drama and I think maybe run it at the beginning of this show and then you have like the YouTube channel where it's live streaming oh my God go to go to YouTube and see what see will it or won't it what's gonna happen um will it or won't it concept this is awesome it's a great concept I remember going to a bar once this isn't it always will by the way a great marketing thing that happened once was uh I went to this bar and the bar owner was like dude we need to come up with a way for people to like buy more drinks or something like and I was like oh you could hire dancers you could do this you could do that like you know make this club like he's like I don't get the money for all that and so we went back like a month later and he had done the most genius thing is in Australia have you ever heard of a crab race no no does the winner not get eaten or something well no it's kind of like it's just the most random dumb thing but everybody got so excited it took a giant Bowl he filled it with these like mini hermit crabs and each hermit crab he just took a Sharpie and he wrote a number one through 50 on it and then basically he's like it's time for The Crab race go buy a drink and pick a number and so everybody gets to buy a drink pick a number and if that's your crab wins the race so they basically put the crabs in a bowl they put it in the middle of the circle they remove the bowl and there's an outer ring and who whichever crab gets to the outer ring first wins and that is the hero crab he gets to like come back next week and like defend his his championship um and anybody who bet on that crab gets like whatever's either some money or like free they're like free shots for like you know you and all your friends or whatever it is and so it just created this hype people started dying every week for this thing I don't I don't think he invented it I think other bars do this but he like he brought that concept into his bar the first time I had ever seen it I've never seen an American Bar do this and I cannot tell you how much excitement this this one simple thing we need that for this podcast every episode yeah that's that's really awesome that's a great idea people in the comments on YouTube should bet a number pick a number and we just and then at the end of the episode are they in like every other episode or whatever we like do the reveal and we uh we show who won uh we should do that we should do that for this podcast we should do something like that for the Pod call your crab guy and I'm not a guy yeah forgot one of my favorite ones dude you might you'll appreciate this as a dog guy have you seen the Puppy Bowl I love the Puppy Bowl genius genius idea that the who's the Animal Planet did I think basically what happened was they were like the like you know the head of programming it's like hey what are we gonna run this Sunday to that that will get ratings and they're like uh against the Super Bowl great yeah let me uh like thanks for the impossible task what can I come up with that's gonna run on Sunday against the Super Bowl and still get viewers and that's when they created The Puppy Bowl which is kind of actually the same idea as the Crab race the basically it's a bunch of puppies with toys and there's a ref and basically if any puppy randomly Walks Into The End Zone with a toy the ref is like touchdown this guy scored you missed one low hanging fruit that I thought was pretty obvious super blunt Sunday what are we gonna do with that I know I don't know yet but it's super blonde Sunday it all starts with the phrase I like super blunt Sunday surely we will work backwards from the name kind of guy I know yeah um anyway good pot people are gonna have some facts yeah you get to be a know-it-all this Sunday and just remember everybody loves a know it all to roll in [Music]

I have to formally and humbly apologize to Mr Beast so here's the situation [Music] all right let's jump in I have a bunch of topics here um I gotta start with an apology I have to formally and humbly apologize to Mr Beast so here's the situation we've talked about it a little bit before uh back when we did Camp MFM we invited Mr Beast um and I should say invited meaning we invited ourselves to his house uh basically in order to do it we were like oh yeah we're gonna do this he's like yeah that'd be cool but you know schedule's a little crazy I'm interested but you know not in LA because I'm in North Carolina we're like oh coincidence what town do you live in that's where we're doing it and so we went out there had a good time one of the things that happened was I made them we were touring Duke's uh campus and we're on on their basketball court and I made him a bet that I could I could make a half court shot before he did for ten thousand dollars very stupid bet he he stood the game nothing and used to gain everything so he could get ten thousand dollars also oh I didn't know that you had to pay him ten thousand dollars all right yeah yeah whoever made it first um so so put 10 grand up he's like I had learned this over the course of a few days he's like me he's a he's a bit of a degenerate Gambler like uh I think his company they have like a separate bank account or it's like yeah Beast you could gamble this but don't don't touch the main stuff uh and that's all money he already one from gambling so they're like look that's your house money to play with petty cash pedicure cash um I think although I think the petty cash was like seven figures if I was getting them correct so anyways bet them this amount hit the shot glorious moment and then um it's like we're so busy you know we just go back to doing the camp and it's like yeah cool uh you know I'll pay you um and I was like great yo baby that's what he does and so he didn't right away and so I was like and everybody all the other people on the trip are like yo that was awesome awesome moment um did he pay you and I had to just be like no no not yet but he's good for it for sure right he's good for it and um and so that became the running joke was like no no he didn't pay yet but but he will and um and I brought it up on the podcast because I I talked about this on the on our end of your Awards as like a highlight moment was saying dude I bet you I can make the shot in half court of Cameron Indoor Stadium this hallowed you know college basketball stadium and just having the balls to make that bet and then having the the the luck of hitting it um was a high moment and I said the low moment was following up like three weeks later and be like hey man hey hey um you got that but yeah no no rush but you got that money yeah this wasn't a fake bet this was a real bet bro like you know first set it in a joking way like ah [ __ ] better pay my money then three weeks later like hey did you pay and so then I was like oh man low moment was being the like having to follow up and being like yeah basically begging for the cash he was cool the whole time he was just like oh yeah my bad I'll have my assistant pay and I was like yeah no problem uh cool and so that I said that joke on the podcast and then people have been referencing it like uh like later like people will I don't know why listeners reference it they tweet about it every once in a while and so I guess he saw this tweet recently and this is now like many months it's like six six months later yeah he was like uh somebody was somebody tweeted out this whole story this whole thread they go you know I I realize why the Mr Beast not paying you stories like didn't sit right with me and it's because you Sean also stood me up you said you wanted to invest in my thing and that we should talk and then I followed up three times over email asking me like hey you said you wanted to invest and like let's talk let's talk and you haven't replied to three of my emails and like you're ghosting me just like he goes to do um not cool and if you want to you know make things right you should take that call and you should invest in my company and so he kind of put this out there as a bit of a ballsy tweet thread and um Mr B saw it and he DM me he's like what are you talking about like I paid you like a while back what do you mean and I was like what oh and I went oh dude so I had given him a Bitcoin like a fresh Bitcoin wallet because he's like I'll pay you a Bitcoin I was like all right no problem and I'd give him a Bitcoin wallet and uh I never checked this thing because like you know who checks it's like a random Bitcoin wallet you created he paid me back in November and so for months I've been like telling this joke about the like hey uh you know just I I know you probably meant to do it but you didn't do it yet just uh when you get a chance no no rush when you get a chance just you think he's pissed at you no I don't think I don't think he was a [ __ ] uh in the same way that I didn't actually give a [ __ ] I just thought it was funny like uh like um the other thing we learned at that camp with from that guy minhaj the the comedian he goes comedy is all about low status and I remember that and I took that I was like oh my comedy is usually trying to be cocky funny like somebody says something and I say how dude you know like you were like you don't know about pop culture and I was like bro I am pop culture right like it's more cocky but actually what I learned from Hudson was that low status is actually a more a funnier more endearing way to to you know sort of win people over so telling this story about like yeah that I had to follow up and it turned from this cool moment to this incredibly lame moment that was a loss it's a it's trying to do a low status comedy thing but then I realized I had been wrong the whole time he paid me in November so so uh yeah whoops damn dude that's a nice that's a pretty big mess up you're just disparaging this guy yeah I was slandering the dude left and right just saying uh you know at least I pay my debts uh right like you know I was I was joking around like that but uh but incorrect he paid all right we have an end happy ending yeah I was shocked that you were saying that on air by the way I chose yeah that he didn't pay I was like I'm this is gonna make me play to him I didn't just say it rarely people asked did he pay and then I'm like oh what am I gonna say yes no if I didn't think he paid I was gonna say no I wasn't just like proactively being like by the way call out you know that that's not how it was I appreciate you know who I uh sometimes you know it's just the people listening it's just Sean and I basically you know Zoom right now we're on a Riverside so just us talking and it's very easy to forget that there's other people who will hear this I found myself saying stuff yeah you get real comfortable you get very comfortable and I admire Joe Rogan I don't listen to Tony Joe Rogan but I do watch some of his clips and he does a really good job of he rarely disrespects people he'll say like oh they just have a difference of opinion it's all good or he'll say someone will bring up hey did you hear how this person was talking trash and he'll just say oh you know that's funny that's funny he does a really good job of not picking fights and uh I saw on your thing on your list you have this kind of fight that started and it looks like I started it and I don't want it to come off that way but basically um on this pod I tried never to like pick fights or if I do pick a fight it's like I'm actually gonna go to battle with this and you have this uh what's the guy's name Steven Bartlett thing on there yeah yeah I want to bring that up yeah by the way I I actually want to say this uh you're right that when it's me and you just talking like this and there's nobody else here it's really easy to get comfortable you forget oh cool 150 000 people are listening right if I was in front of an audience if I could see 150 000 people there's no way I would feel as comfortable and as loose making jokes or or saying something or like I'll do this often it's got me in a lot of trouble actually yeah you say so it's bad and I decided as long as I'll as long as I'm saying something that I actually think um I'm gonna carry on in that way because uh I don't usually think negative things about people well the way that I do it nowadays and the Pod actually taught me this which was if I'm gonna talk negatively about someone behind their back I better be ready to say to their face and so I work really hard to only say things privately that I'm okay saying to that person or even publicly sometimes uh and that's the takeaway I think it was um have you heard the story of like a blink and basically he like talked trash about some guy and they're like I challenge you to a duel and he's like [ __ ] I don't want to go to a duel and so he's like dude I'm sorry I'm afraid I don't want to fight you and then he's like that's it I've never talked trash about people and I remember reading that I'm like that's a good sign and talking trash is easy I do it every once in a while just because I'm human but if you're gonna do it you gotta we gotta be able to say it to their face and so that's kind of my role that I try to live by but it's very hard to follow but all right you want to talk about the Bartlett thing yeah yeah okay so um you Tee It Up because I think you you tweeted it out so what's on your mind there's well nothing I was just curious but basically there's a guy named Stephen Bartlett he's got a pod that's quite good uh it's mostly a YouTube thing I think but uh pretty good he's interviews interesting people background is he had a company called social chain which there's a long story about it that we've talked about before where he basically owned among other things a bunch of Twitter handles and he could help make a product popular or a TV show Popular by sharing it amongst all the Twitter handles whatever it's an agency it was relatively successful it was definitely successful he was like kind of a prodigy it uh ends up getting Acquired and the company that acquired it did like some type of reverse merger it goes public at its peak hundreds of millions of dollars an article came out on Thursday and by the way this guy Stephen he worked for Sean as an intern when he was 21 years old and we've said fun stories about that uh an article came out that said this thing was sold for 8 million and I shared I go whoa this thing was only sold for 8 million I thought this was like a publicly traded company for hundreds of millions I'm a little confused what's the story here and people got pissed not at me they got pissed at him saying um this guy's saying he's built up a 300 million dollar company and they listed tons of evidence saying otherwise and I didn't actually look in the evidence I don't know the truth but people were really angry at that and uh it was it was it was pretty wild to see yeah I think the so you uh I think you framed it well there's basically two things going on here one as somebody gets really famous the Target on their back gets bigger and so he's become more and more famous he uh has a very big kind of social media presence I think he's got like a million followers on Instagram or Twitter or something like that um LinkedIn he's big as well he's on the Shark Tank of England yeah he's on Dragon's Den which is like Shark Tank in um in Europe so he's like well known there he uh wrote a book he you know he's like doing things he goes on he has this podcast he goes on these like tours basically where he like speaks he's a guy I call him the black garyvee uh he's like very much like garyvee in my opinion and in the same way that some people not carry V I'm like bro you didn't build your you know you didn't build a business that was your dad's business that you were just the marketing guy for and he's like well actually like the business was really small and then I started Wine Library TV and it grew much bigger you know there's people who come out and say oh you're not as you represent yourself and so when you see this headline that oh his agency sold for seven million dollars you're like bro what seven million like what why are you representing yourself as much bigger than you are and um the explanation I think is kind of simple so here's the explanation his agency was called social chain when they got acquired they renamed the larger company which didn't have as much of a public facing brand social chain group and so social chain group was a bigger business that did many things had many agencies underneath um had some you know had some other things that there's an e-commerce there's a big e-commerce business that was with it they sold there like a mattress company basically and most of the revenue like comes came from the e-commerce side and a smaller slice of the revenue came from the agency size and even a smaller size came from his specific agency called social chain I think when he sold when social chain got acquired or whatever by the larger group I think they were at roughly 9 million a year in Revenue something like that and that was maybe two years in and it was like a great upstart story it was like 20 employees all under the age of 25 doing this cool disruptive social media you know marketing at the time and uh this is you know 2014 2015 and then you know going acquired by this bigger thing those guys had an e-commerce business and so naturally they're like oh great this marketing agency is a good business to have it'll help our businesses plus it brings in you know Revenue alone from its service business um and I think where he went so I think the the simple explanation is yeah his business got acquired um the overall business did a bunch of Revenue his agency did not uh but you know he was a key player in that overall group I think he was co-ceo of the group of the group the group was you know one of four or five divisions so he was kind of like a division head at uh of uh of a larger company okay great where I think he went wrong is there's like a clip of him on Dragon's Den and the other guy's like do you even know anything about business and he goes know anything about business I built a 300 million dollar company by the age of 28. um and that's like the clip that the guy you know some people on Twitter circulating being like ah okay I didn't you're full of [ __ ] dude you didn't build a 300 million dollar business there was a 300 million dollar business that acquired your small agency to that I say they are correct he did get yeah I mean to me that's like a very maybe it's just relatable because I've been in those situations where I kind of like I feel insecure in a moment and I can imagine being a young guy on TV and then the other investor says what do you know about business I could see your insecurity flaring up in a moment there and try to say try to Puff your chest out and say the biggest thing you can even though it's not technically true it'd be like when we got acquired by twitch it's like you know I and then I ran a division at twitch it'd be like me saying I ran you know I built around a five billion dollar company right that would not be true that would just be like you know um puffing my chest out in a way that's misleading so I think at the ER I was a builder on a three billion dollar company you're you're a builder right I was a part of a company that that was I joined a company 13 years after it was founded and uh you know I was early but but I've I've felt that for example I've I I feel silly about this now which is that when we got acquired the deal was said the deal was I know uh was no like no PR like no no disclosure of the terms um but somehow it got leaked to TechCrunch and I think a couple others that we we got Acquired and um they put a price in there of 25 million and the price was not 25 billion it was less than that um but the answer's got to be no comment but I was like I could have corrected it so I could have gone and said no it wasn't that I didn't even have to say what it was I could have just in retrospect I could have just said it's lower than that but I can't disclose instead I just said hey I can't say anything about it I'm not I'm not allowed to say anything and twitch also said that I'm not allowed to say anything it's so just sat out there and a bunch of people were like wow great exit 25 million and I'm like yeah that would have been a great exit uh it's still good but less good than that so that's not the accurate number and that's still just what sits out there today is that people think that that's what the number was and it kind of benefited me I remember in some ways and every time it benefited me I felt guilty and just like it's also a weak move to like uh take a representation that makes something you did seem greater than it actually was um so I didn't like that and but I can under I can relate to this moment where you're like the ego part of you or the insecure part of you wants to feel like something is he wants to say no I did a great thing uh so you know I I understand where he's coming from in that point of view but I don't really see what the controversy is besides that I think it's just like is the dude more famous than what he did with his agency yeah probably but he's famous because he's amazing at creating content and he's a great like he's he's a great brand Builder he's built his own brand uh how old is he he's only 28 maybe yeah he's like this yeah mid mid to late 20s something like that so I mean I'd say you're doing all right dude yeah he's he's pulled up he's pulled it off I think I think the haters have a point yeah he did over represent he did over represent in some ways yes that's true uh every time he says I built a company worth hundreds of millions of dollars it's not really true um he's a very hateable guy not because I dislike him I actually like his content but I think he's hateable because he's young he's good looking he's successful he's pretty I don't know cocky but like confident I mean you know it's easy to hate people uh so yeah he's he's in some regards a very hateable guy yeah when you have everything that people want uh that's what I know okay you've got money Fame looks charisma you know whatever body what else is there you know I'm not sure I'm not sure he's really missing anything so so yeah there's there's a natural visceral reaction some people have to that which is like either a it can't be all good there's got to be something wrong and I'm gonna find it or B [ __ ] that guy I'm tired of seeing him on my Instagram feed what um what's this Financial Freedom thing that you wanted to talk about let me do let me do two Okay so I want to uh I want to do this story about this uh this woman I met who I think has a really cool cool business so um a couple podcast episodes ago I said hey I got this idea for a d2c business it would be best run I think by a woman who's like got it because it's a it's a product for women um and it uses my my joke which is like uh I don't know how to pitch it exactly so it's like a normal thing but beautifully done I just imagine like you know pens but just beautifully done right like and it's true like that's part of the shtick of this product this is just like it's well packaged and well made uh beautifully done and so anyways I got a bunch of inbound and I I joked about it I was like oh to our four female listeners if you're out there this could be an idea for you um and a bunch of people replied maybe 20 30 40 people said hey what's the idea I wanted to hear about it uh here's my background and one woman had a really interesting background so her name I think is what is it Sarah Michelle something like that um she started this business I'll pull up her name yeah Sarah Michelle so she she built this business called NP reviews I'm guessing you've never heard of this but here's why it's interesting she basically built a course prep business and sold it for more than 10 million dollars in two years and I just think that's kind of a badass move to pull off you don't hear of a lot of course based businesses that sell it all uh let alone sell for eight figures in two years and what she did was basically she built like cat like Kaplan like the test prep thing for nurse practitioners so and so um it's called NBA reviews as a nurse practitioner reviews past your nurse practitioner exam the first time stop stressing and start studying Smarter with our proven exam review courses exactly so she basically says yo you're in school to become a nurse practitioner you have a the the big test is coming up it's like your version of MCAT or else that's if you're a lawyer um the nurse practitioners have that same thing and it's like great take you know work with us and you'll pass they have a 99 pass rate amongst their students so they're like you know don't wear it she's like don't worry I was in your shoes wow I was stressed about this and I pass and if I could pass you could pass I've helped so many people pass since then um and what she does is it's basically a funnel where she's got ads about this and content about about you know this exam or becoming a nurse practitioner which leads you to this landing page which says don't stress we got you 99 pass rate um if we help you pass your upcoming exam and then she funnels you to a Facebook group so basically it's like join the group of 25 000 other people who have passed this exam and um you join the Facebook group and you buy at one of the courses so you can buy this like 300 a month one 130 a month one 100 a month one whichever one you want um that fits like whichever test you're planning to take built this thing up sold it to a company called blueprint that basically is rolling up these test prep things and um I just thought that's an amazing exit and I'm uh I'm super impressed and here's why it's awesome if you go to the bottom right it says powered by kajabi that's a hundred dollar a month software that yeah anyone can get the president of kajabi listens he uh oh I know yeah he dm'd me as well so it's a 100 a month software and they have like a 30-day trial so you can even like not pay and just like get your get get courses like spinning up and then making some money so the website it it's fine looking but it's not like you could make this without a designer uh the copy is pretty solid very clear problem copy is very good like yeah I haven't read it all but it's just decent look at the like just the headline just a quick Copy thing so put this up on the screen on YouTube so go to mpreviews.com just want to point this out so the headline says pass your nurse practitioner's exam the first time so what is it you know leading with a the outcome or the benefit you want versus talking about yourself she could have said we are a test prep you know a six-week test prep program get with uh live online classes and a community blah blah that's how most people pitch their products they talk about themselves she talked about the outcome then the second thing stop stressing and stop start studying Smarter with our proven AAA ancc and ANP exam review courses okay great stop stressing so it's the emotional like the emotional state you're in and tells you you know the emotion the better emotional state you're going to be in and then after that she basically is like I did it you could do it I've helped these 500 people do it here's some testimonials from them here's some pictures of their faces and they're holding up their like certificate that says I passed and they're like thank you Sarah you helped me pass my exam and then she's like there's there's like a Founder lips I've been in your shoes feeling anxiety as you prepare for your nurse practitioner boards you're not alone the stakes are high and these tests aren't easy you need to review course to help you master this I get it because I've been there I remember how I felt studying for this that's why after passing both of my exams I decided to create a review thing to help others too uh since these launch I've helped thousands of people with 98 pass rate uh here's you know how it works blah blah blah join our Facebook group and check it out um just a really well done really simple product really simple idea and I think this by the way this idea could be done with any like trade that has certification so personal trainers get certified for their like Health uh you know stuff and they take this these programs that uh they have to get certifications for whether you're uh you know dental hygienist a speech therapist there's ongoing architect it could be anything ongoing professional education and anything that there's a you know a a finishing school for so like med school nurse nursing school whatever cosmetology or whatever it is being the test prep for that it obviously she's not the biggest one like Kaplan makes a few billion dollars they offer they offer prep for mcats and offer prep for nursing nursing school but you just carve out your Niche and you're the more trusted face you're the more human brand and it's beautifully done [Music] where's the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better dude this is why I hate that question when people ask me if you could start over again with nothing what would you do and I say I would do the same thing and they go does that still work and I would always say of course it does now we have an example milk Road did the exact same thing within the last 12 months and I have another friend named Ben tassel do you know Ben uh he um yeah he had a oh that's what we're doing we're calling it milk road now it's the milk Road of of like the hustle sort of like the milk Road for General business it just happened to proceed about five years yeah Andre the Giant was just the same par of wrestling uh yeah that's what we're gonna do now I like that he's a big buff guy he's pretty much the same part of wrestling um triggered uh well anyway like I say I would do the exact same thing and now you're an example you did the exact same thing and then um uh now there's Ben and Ben goes well I'm just following I I heard he goes I heard in the Pod that Sean said he just copied you so I'm gonna copy Sean copying you and you know what it's working it's working he's got this AI newsletter and it's working and there's a handful of businesses there's a bunch of businesses where it's basically the same thing all the time but a little bit different and maybe not even better just a little bit different or in a particular Niche this course business this is another one of those where it's just the same thing her website is I think it's only like eight or nine or ten Pages she's got the webinar she's got like the different offerings the Facebook group it's the same thing that you can do in any case and in some cases this could be a home run I bet you know like um I sold a little bit early but morning Brew is doing I think they said 70 million in Revenue industry dive sold for 500 million dollars those are all home runs um same with the course business I think there's a world where you can do the exact same thing it could be quite huge although 10 million dollars is is awesome so that's why I think that whenever people ask that question it's stupid or I hate it because you're just looking for an easy answer and you're looking for permission to not to do something because you want me to say it's outdated or doesn't work anymore and my answer to that is no no it works it works don't ask permission just do it right yeah there's a there's a better version of that question uh that question is sort of like the question when somebody asked Elon Musk they're like and Elon you're a great inspiration to many entrepreneurs out there what words of advice do you have to somebody uh to encourage them to start a business and he goes if you need words of encouragement to start a business don't do it that's how I feel about like if you're really clueless about what ideas should I do um first of all this whole podcast has hundreds of ideas of and examples of ideas you could do um don't overthink it you could just do any of those secondly you should have a running list of irritations and problems that you experience in your professional and personal life that you're like God if somebody made a way that made this better or made this easier or made this faster or made this cheaper I would buy it that's a great source of startup inspiration if you're just like I don't know maybe Sam will tell me how to be a successful person that's not what successful people do now having said all that I'm doing it again I have a little example of this okay so I've talked on here about my uh my personal trainer and my personal trainer uh is uh my buddy J A you you've met him before awesome guy has uh become a great friend and has delivered a ton of value in my life um as you know I basically was not working out and was like you know on this steady climb of like yo I'm gonna gain 15 pounds a year for what was your what was your what was your Peak weight 250 220 not too probably at 230 was was like 230. um and not like oh I'm bulking it wasn't muscle mass let's put it that way and uh and so anyways I get in touch with Jay and I'm like hey I want to make a change uh he's like awesome how often do you work it out right now I'm like zero times a month and he's like cool okay let's let's start there and so he came over and took me from like zero to now working out five days a week eating better you know seeing a bunch of you know great gains and results getting stronger fitter healthier more mobile uh all those things I'm playing basketball again my life has gotten a lot better and so I'm like dude you help me with this one area I really wanted help in in my life uh how can I return the favor okay I know I'm paying you but but how can I help you even be on that and so he's basically always wanted to have his own successful business and he's like he's like I see what you do um I think that's awesome I want kind of the same I'm thinking about e-commerce or this or that he goes I want that I want that and I go all right dude I got it for you I have a idea that I think will work that I think will make uh it'll be successful which is great because that's what we want we don't want to fail the second thing is it will lead to a lifestyle that I think you rejoice not a ton of like grunt work that doesn't take a ton of capital up front and so I'm basically check this out I'm gonna create I'm helping him create a milk Road for personal trainers and so basically it's going to be a newsletter that goes out every morning to other like it could be Fitness enthusiasts but I think start starting Market is just other trainers so train the trainers is the thing I keep saying and because I'm like dude you are awesome with workouts you're awesome with mindset stuff you find all these interesting like I don't know links to like cool like oh Andrew huberman said this thing about the supplement check this out you know blah blah um and I was like dude I feel like if you just kind of published your daily you know your daily what's going on your day today as a trainer um that would just be an awesome email to receive if I was another trainer so we created this format and we created this brand and what I'm going to do is I'm gonna help you get the URL uh yeah so the URL there's no sign up yet but I just got the domain uh it's it's so the email is called The Daily pump and so it's mydailypump.com is gonna be the email so go go register for this because I want feedback on it um but I'm gonna build this whole thing in public so milk Road I didn't build in public I was like oh this is a good idea I'm gonna Sprint on this and basically one year built the thing up until the largest crypto newsletter in the world uh and sold it and so you know had a had an awesome outcome there and now that I did that I know how I would do this in like 10 other spaces I don't really want to go do that because it feels like I'd be just doing I'd be on the hamster wheel just playing the same level of the video game even though it's probably smart I have the the knowledge now of how to do it it'd be too boring I don't want to do it but this has a different like meaning right if I could help him build up this business I think that will be you know like just helping my friend out with something that I know would really uh be helpful to be impactful to them and so uh so that's what I want to do and I'm going to share how we build this thing up you know sort of step by step and my it's been a really interesting process because he's not from the startup or business world and so a lot of times at the beginning I was like oh yeah we should do this and he's like yeah yeah dope um and then he wouldn't do it and I'm like I got frustrated and I this happens to me with a bunch of people who I'm like dude you I meet somebody they're like oh I wanna improve my situation I'm like oh yeah you just got to do this or I'd I'd back you if you could find something I'll bring the capital you do the work and they're like yeah yeah yeah and then three weeks later I don't hear from them and I used to think oh it's because they're lazy and I actually realized it's not because they're lazy they're not lazy people in fact usually the person I'm trying to help they're working 10 times harder than me at their day job right one guy was a plumber and uh you know it's like okay this guy's doing much harder work it's not that he's lazy it's that they're afraid and they're confused so they're afraid to fail and they're afraid to look dumb if they do the wrong thing or saying the wrong thing to me and they're also just confused they don't know where to start they just never started something like this from scratch and for me I knew we spent now 15 years doing this it's very easy to think oh dude I just spin up a landing page I would set this up on beehive and then I would go over here and I would do this and then I would I would not focus on that other stuff and I wouldn't care about advertisers till I get to 20 000 subscribers and like I would scrape this email list I would do this ad and I would and they're like dude I don't I've never run a Facebook ad I've never done a landing page never done any of this stuff I don't want to talk about that stuff publicly I I kind of regret it a little bit because like you had this at milk Road I didn't I had it a little bit as well where like people in South America or other countries were just like copying they would like translate it and then just send the email like 30 minutes later and in one regard it's flattering but another I'm like um and sometimes it's harmful but other times it just pisses me off um most of the time it just pisses me off it's not harmful but I don't I've changed once we got audiences I was like I don't want to talk about this stuff and so I get nervous about that now I don't think you have like whether this thing succeeds or not it doesn't impact you other than you want to help your friend so I want to help you I think if I talk about it publicly it's going to keep me invested in it it's Gonna Keep Me engaged because I'm gonna have to like keep reporting the story and I also think it's easier for me to justify the time because this takes time for me to help and I already had a pretty busy plate but if I could say well you know what I'm able to use this for stories as content that that then then I don't have to separately make other content so that's my selfish justification I also think uh if somebody was going to copy this blueprint I wouldn't do it in personal trainers that's only because he is a personal trainer there's 30 other niches where this would work better than for personal trainers um and I think that because it's specific to him and it actually fits his it's authentic and if it's his his actual like where he is a master like in the same way I'm like dude I don't get it why don't you just blah blah blah what I realized was he probably looks at me and says the same thing he's like dude I told you to increase your protein intake and just eat these macros you'll get the body you want six months but here I am at your house and there's a Chick-fil-A wrapper what's going on here right like that's the equivalent right like or he'd be like oh you should wake up and do this morning cardio thing fast fasted cardio it'll only take you 10 minutes sounds so easy sure enough I he shows up I got some excuse as to why I didn't do it I'm like oh I just forgot that like a beginner is always going to go through these stages and I just got to stay patient with him the way he's been patient with me now I do those things when he says them much better than I did at the beginning you gotta get this page up though you got to get this page up by tomorrow or I'm gonna get it up before this uh before this thing is done but the cool thing that I've been doing by the way is I've been posting I've been texting him one thing every day I'm like yo you gotta just do uh I'm like the way you get like you give me a workout of the day it's like sit down for as I go to the gym for an hour and you're gonna do this workout and I just got to listen to you follow your blueprint and it's gonna get the result I want because you've done this you've mastered this this you're a black belt in this I was like I'm gonna do the same thing on the business side I'm not gonna hope you get hope you figure it out I'm not gonna leave it to you to figure it out I'm gonna give you one thing a day to do it'll probably take you about an hour I'm gonna give you your daily workout each day and um and so that's how we're doing it one day one little text message at a time and I'm like his business trainer the way he's my personal trainer so it's been kind of interesting to see how that's worked that's been pretty effective to be honest I'm eager to see if you regret this or not he'll pull it off it's going to be at least mildly successful because he's got a massive head start because we're going to be talking about it but I told him I was like dude I'm not going to give up on you I was like if I was like you would have you could have given up on me and been like dude this guy's not this guy you paid him still yeah I pay him but like you know so there's obviously a little difference there but like there's a difference between you show up and do the job or you go the extra mile he goes way the extra mile with me so like you know uh my kids are raging out he'll be holding one of my kids so I can get the workout in while he's training me or like he'll come in on an off day and just make the gym better just just a surprise and be like look I want your environment to be dope because you're going to just get that extra five to ten percent juice and join your environment and you know a trainer doesn't have to do all that they don't have to come and rearrange your gym and and help you with your kids or show up you know stay for two hours extra because whatever you know that sort of stuff so I've got this friend named Nick Gray do you know who Nick Ray is he's the uh Party Guy so Nick Gray is my good friend yeah he started a thing called Museum hack where he took he had another company that like made parts for private planes or something like that that he sold and then he started a thing called Museum hack which was Private Tours and museums he sold that now he's got a new thing called the two-hour cocktail party it's a book on cocktail parties and how to host the perfect cocktail party it's honestly quite good I use his techniques he's doing this new thing that he just showed me where whenever he goes to a bar or a restaurant or a museum or anything he takes a picture of the food or the the front of the building and he reviews it but can you see the go to the MDB link I I have in there look at what he does so he posts a review of the place but he puts his book in the picture and he's been and he's been testing this and over the past couple months his photos there's like analytics on it they have two million views on his pictures and this guy Nick he's crazy so he just tweeted out this thing he goes I'm gonna host a conference for all my ex-girlfriends he's got a lot of ex-girlfriends because he dates a lot and he's very Charming so girls love him but he's really nice and so he stays friends with all of his ex-girlfriends one time this guy for his 40th birthday party he rented out a a water park and there was like 30 of us and I swear to God I'm not exaggerating four of the guests were his ex-girlfriends and they were all hanging out together and he's like I'm gonna so this guy's crazy but look at this you can you see the link to his Google is so funny this is the funniest growth hack I've seen in a long time so he has a Blog do you think this is effective I would never do something like this he's got this blog post coming out tomorrow or the next day and it's I think if you just Google Nick Gray g-r-a-y you'll see the blog post I I don't know the name of his website it's probably just nickray.com uh and he's gonna like reveal the results but he was showing me this I was like Nick why I was just out to eat with them the other day and he was and he had his book with them he pulled it out of his bag and he was taking a picture I go what are you doing he goes check this out and he showed me his Google reviews he goes they have analytics on this that my vid my uh photos in the last couple months I've gotten to 1.8 million views 1.9 million views is this hilarious or what that's so funny that's this is such a funny and it reminds me of somebody the story is better than the actual growth hack so somebody said this about um Pinterest too they go yeah Pinterest man they were such Grinders I remember they used to go into the Apple Stores and change all the default um default homepages to pinterest.com on the Macs that are sitting on the table yeah and who knows if that works I'm like dude this guy's spending hours driving to Apple Stores to try to get like five Impressions on his website and think that somebody's gonna be like huh you know I went there for an iPhone but you know what I really want to do what was that website I saw on the demo computer I'm gonna go sign up and make an account and become a daily active user like that doesn't happen but the story The Hustle story is makes it worth it and I've done I've done several of those where the hustles makes it sound like you were going to the nth degree even though it made zero sense to do so he has reviews of everything there's one of Panda Express of Lululemon of Charlie's Subs Vans the store any store that he goes to he's taking this really good picture of like the front like there's a Great American Cookies it looks like it's just like an Annie aunt in the mall he takes a picture of the front and just has his book in his hand there's this guy on Yelp that Sarah and I follow because he has he like tests all the good food places in New York and San Francisco and he had a newborn when he started doing it and all the pictures of his newborn eating the food and then it was like you see the baby get like one year old two-year-old three or four I start like getting to know this kid and we're always like look that guy's been there and it's actually an interesting hack that I think could actually I don't know if it this one will work but there's like these weird personalities that I've seen on Yelp and on Google reviews where I start to get to know them and I trust the reviews and it's actually a really fascinating platform to hack and I wanted to bring that up because I've never really seen uh like insights like this and I think it's incredibly fascinating yeah that's super cool do you know what I'm doing right after the top of the hour yeah you have uh can you talk you want to announce it what you're doing yeah yeah yeah so how did you do this by the way how did you pull this off all right so we have this guy named Michael Harris nicknamed Hario I don't know I'm gonna interview him and find out his story so I don't want to like reveal his whole story because I don't know the whole thing but basically he's one of the co-founders of Death Row Records and when I sometimes Sarah and I my wife we volunteer in prisons and we work with this thing called The Last Mile I've told you about the last mile my friend Chris he's a tech guy he started it it basically helps teach inmates how to do Tech stuff so hopefully they can get a job once they let out well a lot of those people are like convicted murderers it's wild and through that I met Michael and he basically went to prison for 30 years at the a in his 20s and before that he made up to a million dollars a day selling crack and cocaine I think and helped discover Denzel Washington and sponsored or funded uh Broadway plays and things like that and parlayed that into music and thus created Death Row Records which shook night and he has all these stories about Snoop Dre Tupac so we're going to talk to him uh uh and figure out a story are you a little bit intimidated to have this conversation incredibly because I don't know you're not like the big a big pop culture guy but like basically like there's you know he's a girl with me he's I'm pop culture dude you didn't know who Dolly part was but basically like I there's a lot of like I read a book about Eazy-E and easy and Dre and death row had a beef and I don't know like where that stands and like if I can say who I'm a fan of and who I'm not a fan of so I'm a little nervous because this guy it's not like our friends or our enemies on Twitter where we're just gonna argue of course this guy will never do anything bad but like you know like that's it's a little bit more real he's more capable for sure don't make the mistake of um don't make the mistake of like referencing Somebody by first name if you don't know them they'll be like yeah I was reading about ease and uh they say ease yeah easy but I don't know I'm just trying to seem cool here it's like what people yeah so they say they're coming to visit the Bay Area and they go hey I'm gonna be in San Fran this week and I just have to tell them I say hey man listen just as a friend nobody says San Fran here so you're just outing yourself as a tourist as soon as you say that that's how I feel so I feel I want to be respectful um and I but I also want to like let them know that like you know I've listened to all this music I've read a lot of books about it but purely from an academic standpoint so like that's yeah so it feels like a little funky but like I was talking to him the other day because the reason I got in touch with them is he wants to like launch some podcasts or he's just brainstorming and he asked to talk to me and I said yeah and he starts talking and I'm like hey you realize that like when you're talking to me about this drug trade and things like that like you talk about delegation and empowering your co-workers and things like that like right this is business stuff do you want to come on the Pod and so I thought it'd be cool yeah we've had people who've made you know originally this podcast called my first million because it was let's interview people who've made a million bucks in many different ways so I interviewed you know a business person then I interviewed a poker player and then somebody who made it through selling um you know weighted blankets online and somebody who made it doing you know deodorant somebody made it doing 100 got junk and like a whole bunch of different things but now we have somebody who who did it in uh in some other some new ways selling crack cocaine uh record label and who knows what else that's I think it's gonna be amazing I'm joking around just because I know if I was in your position I would feel a little squirmy uh going into it like just like how do I not say something stupid like I know this could be great this is when things are are tough It's when you know it could be great but you also know it could easily go not great if you don't build rapport or you don't really know how to guide the conversation properly because it's not your standard interview right like if we brought somebody on who built a SAS company to you know 20 million dollars would be like cool I know the same I know 20 questions to ask you that are all safe you're going to give me 20 answers that are all safe and um I know exactly how the conversation is going to go and it really can't go anywhere that's out of my comfort zone in terms of a question or a or a topic to talk about whereas this one's going to be you know the ZIP code is out of your comfort zone so you're not gonna I I know how I would feel going into that interview that's why I I wanted you to I wanted you to come um because I thought it'd be fun since you are you're you're even a few more zip codes away than I am are you sure are you sure you can't make it you should uh yeah yeah exactly Death Row Records name's a bit crude don't you think do you ever think of something softer like milk Road for example no um yeah unfortunately I got another thing scheduled at that time but um um all right that's the Pod by the way the gentleman's agreement is working by the way I went to a party with a bunch of 23 year olds sounds a lot worse than it is a friend turned 23 he asked me to go Jeffrey's party on an island yeah yeah yeah it was that like the Lolita like Taco uh taco place no uh he I had so many people come up to me and said hey by the way I honored the gentleman's agreement that's because the show we have this thing called the gentleman's agreement we make this content for free and um but it's not actually free to listen in exchange you got to go subscribe to our YouTube and it's working we're getting like 800 to a thousand new YouTube subscribers a day so yeah this basically is 3x the number of daily subscribers we were getting on our YouTube channel everyone told us to do this the whole time and we're like you're an idiot they'll no one follows that yeah we also we we kind of yeah we say it a lot now but for like two years we never told anybody to do anything so we're just kind of we're due yeah we're due [Music]

it's like yeah I took one look at you it's like how much longer do you want to live as a New York five because you could be in Idaho nine with one plane ticket baby and so I I feel like every city should have to make their pitch as to why a 20-something year old should move there and live there that a 25 year old I might create a whole new show around just this just this pitch [Music] Ben this is your segment you you own this segment you take it away all right here we go we're reviewing the news we're letting the boys react uh by the way I like the thing you started doing where you're like fellas I think that's kind of like on the first episode of the news of the boys react I feel like you kind of nailed the catchy thing like that was pretty natural by you good good move by you fellas there is a new Instagram the founders Instagram are back with a new app it's called artifact it's being described as Tick Tock for text um fellas is this the next big thing damn did you see this thing so the page says I'm trying to pull it up the page doesn't really say what it is it's okay they they in the news they kind of talked a little bit more so I heard Tick Tock for text and I was like okay what is that basically it means two things number one Kevin system the founder of Instagram was like when I saw Tick Tock and how the feed works where you just open the app you're already in you don't have to follow a bunch of people you just start swiping and it just learns what you like he's like oh this is the way everything should work this way I can't believe Twitter doesn't work this way I can't believe why are we still trying to do this like manual follow interesting people thing when I suggest the the app should just give you what you're interested in uh through machine learning so he goes that's number one number two what they're doing is they're instead of what Tick Tock did for videos these guys are trying to do with news actually not just text but news so they're trying to serve you text-based news based on your interest um and that's where that's where he lost me I don't think people want to read a bunch of news in the same way that they're willing to like swipe through mindless videos for entertainment and so I think that's where it has this problem that a lot of Silicon Valley ideas have which is they try to sell you what you should do instead of what you want to do and it sounds Noble and high and mighty and when they go to dinner parties and they say this is what we're gonna do everybody you know Pats them on the back but I think that this is not going to work for news so I'm out so here's the thing that I'm wondering by the way you like how I went Shark Tank on it and now I'm in or out that's maybe a new that might be a new part of this I'm not I'm out all right well you can't see me but I'm holding like I've been watching Andrew Tate videos because it's just hilarious now that he's in jail and it's kind of funny he always holds his hands like in a V when he's sitting down uh and that's like how the alpha sits so you gotta like if you're gonna say you're out you gotta like sit with like your yeah yeah yeah there you go you gotta like so that's yeah there it is that's all Alpha sit according to Andrew Tate let me try that again and for that reason I'm out yeah a little I had a little snap to it my wrist felt a little something there yeah so here's the thing um they've been this guy Kevin Systrom killed it right you know this little fella he created Instagram awesome been out of the game that's Ring rust my friend when you I watch it absolutely I've watched enough uh fighting to know that ring rust is real for a lot of people so I wonder like is he actually in touch with uh what people want is he hungry is him and his partner you know they're billionaires flying on planes with Ashton Kutcher does he actually know what people want but I don't know about you but I study a lot of Japanese like he's like Ashton Ashton I see you got Tick Tock open wouldn't you rather that those were all just news articles dude I the the I love studying like how the Chinese and particularly the Japanese do things the Japanese these news apps in Japan are so popular it works wonderfully now what works in Japan it don't necessarily work here two totally different cultures there's a term for that I'm not going to pretend to even know what that term is but it's like basically when things work in Japan and vice versa in America it doesn't always translate to each of those cultures because they're so different but it works there maybe it could work here in fact I think the parent company of bite dance uh or Tick Tock bite dance they have another app which is basically this it's an algorithmic news app called I don't know how you pronounce like teautau I don't know I don't know how you say it's Xiao I don't know what the name of it is but this is what it does and it's super super popular so maybe maybe yeah that's the right answer baby but uh I don't know it's just I think it's hard to be a billionaire who's been out of the game and to start something from scratch I think that uh I gotta I gotta give us a director's note here so I was watching something uh somewhere and basically uh I was watching first take the you know like the I don't know if you've ever watch these ESPN shows where it's like two guys doing this they react to the news um these shows only work if you disagree so um basically on all of these by default you got to take one side and then I gotta argue the other uh regardless of how I actually feel so if I'm out you gotta be in and I think it's a good case to be in to say you know this actually already Works in China and Japan so just I'm just saying good content comes from disagreement not agreement I was a hard maybe you were a hard no that's kind of a disagreement yeah that's far enough it's far enough all right all right what else we got Ben all right next one uh the thing everyone is talking about tech layoffs more than 150 000 Tech workers have already been laid off in the last six months that includes 12 000 at Google 18 000 Amazon 11 000 meta 10 000 Microsoft so fellas any advice for our fallen comrades comrades I hate that these people use the word comrades I saw dude we are not comrades these guys made like they're trying to do the Soviet Union [ __ ] bro you made 600 000 a year in Cash Plus another 250 000 in stock bonuses and you had free pizza every single day yeah we are now you can drink oat milk like get out of here yeah yeah yeah we are not comrades like you know like like you know comrades don't like eat grape upon we are not that so I hate when people say comrades and plus we're not even Conrad conrades I don't know a person who works at Google whenever Sam lacked motivation he would just go meet a lazy Google engineer and just be and just get their W-2 salary out of them and then he was like fuel ignited back to the lab I am dude I remember I went to the Facebook campus once and I remember I overheard people complain that the line for the so like Facebook's campus for those who haven't gone it's basically like a like it's like a mall it's like a mall but everything's free I'm not joking I wrote an article about this actually if you look up like Sam par Facebook office they had a vending machine but instead of candy bars it was like computers yeah iPhone Char you could get like a computer MacBook charger if you just like push if you push D3 you would just get a huge MacBook charger yeah it was all free it's incredible and then they had like a dentist they had a barber they had a dude I swear to God they had a wood making like a wood shop like you can go and like there's a van you could just go and get a hand job if you're bothering you it's crazy dude they have everything there they you could go and leave your car and your oil would get changed when you came back from work I remember seeing all this stuff and I just thought of like oh this is it we made it and then I realized that the tenure at Facebook is like 18 months and so I was like oh okay this isn't actually all the good so anyway long story short these people ain't comrades okay but what are they gonna do I actually don't know like is a hundred thousand is 150 000 layoffs I'm not I'm not well versed enough in like the macro economy what's going to happen to them I I don't know do I think they're gonna start companies no I don't some will some will and I think that's uh that's good um I think it's good to recite I think it's good for these companies to trim the fat they got way too much fat uh when I went and when we were getting acquired by twitch twitch had I think 2 000 employees at the time and um they made me like do go through a round of interviews during the acquisition process like you know meet the team and whatever and they would ask me questions for 55 minutes and then the last five minutes they would say do you have any questions for us and I just said how many employees does twitch have and then they would say 2000 and then I'd say how many employees do you think twist should have and uh this was my IQ test for them and I was trying to see uh if I was actually not even IQ test it was an honesty test um who here has the courage to say a number less than two thousand and um only one most were just taken aback by the question because they knew what I was implying uh because they you know if they said if they said more I just started laughing uncontrollably if they said 2000 is the right number I would raise the people's eyebrow and be like oh really you just happen to have the perfect match of resources to to needs like isn't that isn't that fortunate that you guys are just playing it perfectly wow you guys are amazing leaders and if they were honest and said you know um if we wanted to just keep doing what we're doing we probably only need 250 amazing people and for us to do some of the new initiatives new bets I think maybe another another hundred people would be would be right I would stand and give them I would give them a standing ovation in a job interview which is awkward because they're just sitting down in front of me uh only one person was honest in that out of the seven that I talked to that day the rest were liars and so uh so yeah these companies have had it coming they need to trim the fat if you got laid off it's okay I'm sure you will bounce back you uh you've had a very very cushy situation for a very long time hopefully you built up a little safety net for yourself and uh go do something interesting I think this is a healthy recycling and flushing of the system um you know this is the juice cleanse for Silicon Valley right this is the detox cleanse for silica Valley it needs to it needs needed to happen dude juice cleanses are the stupidest thing it's not like it's not like the juice is like a pipe cleaner my influencers tell me differently dude I hate when people talk about this like it's not like you're just like you have like gunk in your veins and like the juice goes through like a pipe cleaner just pulling the gunk cleaning your veins I always hated that idea of a cleanse but in this case yeah I think that is actually true [ __ ] we're agreeing again but um dude a lot of a lot of these companies are really generous uh like they're giving six months uh lee or six months Severance and if you have been there for a while you get even more so I actually think that it you know now's a good opportunity to turn [ __ ] into gold and take you know two months to freaking chill which sorry they kind of already were I bet but take some time to like actually chill and then get after it and um you know there's I've been thinking about uh job hunting I call it job hunting because a lot of people think of like oh I'm out I hope hopefully I'll find a job and I'm like no no Now's the Time to job hunt you know you make like a list of 10 companies where you're going to work you uh find the hiring manager and you hunt them down and you get that job you know it's a hunt it's not like a you know I'll just apply to these 100 companies on indeed and hold slash their tires you put your resume inside the tire when they go to find it that's all they know you wanted it yeah so now's that time and I I always perform best when I have my backings to all you know we use that phrase burn the burn the ships or burn the boats you know you now is maybe a good time so hopefully people will find opportunity in it but let's get one straight one thing straight we're not comrades okay give me a break I I hate that stuff I didn't cut the words comrade listen comrades and solidarity I never want to hear that word solidarity again more behind the scenes someone else wrote the question which they actually wrote uh any advice for our fallen brothers and sisters but I like to thank you as Sam who is just setting himself up for like I'm gonna I'm gonna set up this question and tear it down don't say solidarity don't say comrade if you make over a hundred thousand dollars a year you you don't you don't get solidarity okay uh these next ones rapid fire okay uh Doomsday Clock the Doomsday Clock got moved to 90 Seconds To Midnight uh this is largely due to fears that the Ukraine war could escalate into a nuclear conflict Doomsday Clock is all these nuclear scientists who just tell us how close the world is to ending fellas are we all gonna die no I I've I honestly had never even heard of this Doomsday Clock Ben you're the historian around here is this a common is this something I should have known about and uh does this happen all the time or how big of a deal is this bed and it's not like by the way it's not like a clock right it's more like a meter is this like Smokey the Bear like uh like what's the threat of like a bonfire so it is a wildfire you know like there's smoke in the bear it's like today's like a day where like there could be a fire the clock is a bad thing because yeah yeah it's always hits midnight it started during uh during the Cold War and there's basically a bunch of nuclear scientists got together and wanted to tell everyone how close the world was to ending so everyone would take the threat of nuclear war nuclear disarmament very seriously the problem with the with the clock is it started at I think like three minutes to midnight and so like every time something happens they're like oh we're we're actually really close we're Two Minutes to Midnight um and and the clock moves back and forth a little bit so uh so we're at like the 50 yard line basically that's also a dumb analogy why that's a distance because what they were trying to do is like give people this feeling of impending doom right like it's only a matter of time Russia and the United States for you or like uh you know what do you need like a weightlifting analogy I want like a like a like a like a temperature bulb you know like the temperature can go up and down I just think look you want the Smokey the Bear thing I was thinking about this since like humans started existing if this was like a book it would be like a thousand pages and the period that we're in now would be like a paragraph on the thousandth page and I just I just think I am not so important that this one paragraph is going to be more important than the rest of the Thousand pages so I almost always refuse to believe that anything doomsday related is gonna happen while I'm here so no I'm not worried about this at all that was a good analogy by the way the book thing you're welcome that's a free one all right uh chat GPT can pass a bunch of tests now uh it can pass the U.S medical licensing exam and it passed a test from the Wharton MBA program University of Pennsylvania uh are you annoyed that you didn't have the chance to use chat GPT to cheat in high school and or college hey hey Ben how come you didn't read the uh the actual headline that's written in the doc I'm curious well what's wrong with that one it says chat GPT is rgbt is Asian how good it is at taking these tests and I gotta say I had my human chat gbt I was a prolific cheater throughout School uh fifth grade reading program I ordered I organized a Syndicate I realized that if I I was not going to read 32 books and win but I had 10 friends and if we each read three books that we could get to the 30 bookmark and all win we would all just take the test for each other that's what we did I won the teacher called my mom let her know that I had cheated my mom couldn't have been prouder uh the second thing that happened um you know math tests they used to uh give us a TI-83 calculator and um my buddy used to be smarter than me and take the test before me and then he would just type in all of the answers into the TI-83 calculator under the Y equals sign button and I used to just simply open that up and fill in the answers and go on my way so I don't need Chad gpt3 I was ahead of the curve on this and um I you know cheater's gonna cheat dude we used to take you know how you're allowed to have like a water bottle at in school we used to take the labels off like the Dasani bottles and write the answers and the cheat sheet on the back of the label and then put the label back on and that was where the answers were and so I don't know man that deserves an a just for that but uh am I jealous that they have this yeah sure but I'm not jealous that I'm in school again nerds so we win that one I have a wife yeah yeah by the way Sean I didn't read the headline because it only got a B on the test at Wharton so I'm not sure if God nice nice I have nothing to do with this what else you got all right uh Justin Bieber uh sold his share of his back catalog for 200 million dollars to an investor smart move yeah definitely why why did he do it you know has he had income coming in like why I think somebody said his tour got canceled but that I mean is he really living tour to tour at this point I I don't know I think I would just assume it was a good offer and he had to make a decision he decided yeah so let's go with that dude Dr Dre did the same thing and people are like why would you do that and someone said well listen to this so he got he recently got divorced and so he owes his wife you know half of what he had he probably made 500 million dollars off of Beats half of that went to his wife and then there was another article that said in the divorce it was released that they were spending three million dollars a month so on travel clothes so that's 36 million dollars Neil potato status yeah man holy moly so he actually probably needed the money is it smart yeah he he better go write some hits now man he better get dancing uh but yeah you know look dude he sold it the work that he did from 13 to like 30 he sold for 200 million dollars that's pretty dope and by the way he sold just his share the the like he owns only a smallest part you know his agent and then the label owns it and the whoever there's like four other parties involved in this so he just sold his share which means his total back catalog has got to be worth close to a billion dollars um a good move in fact I'm just going to say this now if I ever sell something for 200 million dollars and people come to be questioning if this was a good move you're getting a slap you're getting a slap from me and like do you need an explanation as to why I took this 200 million dollar check like I mean how dare you you better have 900 million dollars if you're gonna ask me a question like that if you ask me that question I will say please show me 900 million dollars before I answer this question otherwise you get in a slap and uh so so yeah I do not question this also Bieber makes good decisions he follows me on Twitter two dots make a line baby that's two data points of Bieber making good decisions and that's a lot two dots don't make a line but uh just because it Rhymes and sounds good it doesn't mean that it actually works any two points can be connected by a line two dots make a line all right does he really does he really follow you on Twitter by the way he does dude DM him did you DM him uh I never have been sort of crafting the right way a couple dozen years now how many people did they follow how many other people does he follow smooth two hundred eighty thousand oh there's the line does he follow you does he follow any of the bends on this call no dude by the way uh you made the announcement on one pod that you want a woman to reach out to you because you have a great d2c idea that you want to help from a woman I have had like 15 women reach out to me half of them think that I'm you because we only have four female listeners so they must have told them oh by the way we're not saying that anymore someone had to talk with me I'm gonna bring it up next part we're gonna we shouldn't say that anymore I'm gonna explain why but for now that joke is killer okay no it's not and I'll explain why later but listen I've had about 15 women and like seven of them like have a million followers on Instagram and like wow their profiles are are such that when I'm scrolling through them and Sarah my wife is sitting next to me she's like what are you looking at because it's like the hottest Instagram models in like bikini models and things like that so like I don't know what you're getting at but it probably worked I don't know what you're working yeah so I had so many people reach out to me well well send them to me right why do they reach out to you oh it's because my Instagram's like private and like locked uh oh yeah that's not gonna be that's not gonna work yes still I'm still uh I've there's definitely been some good Outreach I'm talking to two people who I think are the right how many people uh I don't know I didn't count maybe 20 25 something like that I had a lot of serious people reached out I had a lot and there and and and up yeah they're trying to reach you or they think that I'm you it's pretty funny um but anyway that's that this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better I have just one last one last one which is a new study uh shows how much money you need to make to be in the top one percent income earner in every state 850 000 in California New York Connecticut is tops actually surprisingly with nine hundred thirty thousand dollars the bottom is West Virginia uh with three hundred seventy thousand dollars per year to be the top one percent this question is specifically for Sam Sam what do you have to say to my comrades who are not in the top one percent oh oh um I actually am going to do a big thing about this next episode that shows that you can be in the one percent of New York and make that income and still not be able to retire because that's how much it costs to live there um yeah dude move to Missouri uh I think that's crazy 800 000 is so much money um it's so much money so eight hundred thousand dollars by the way is 456 000 post-tax and um if you assume that you spend fifteen or twenty thousand dollars a month which is very reasonable and that means they're saving like 200 Grand a year you just gotta you gotta make that for 20 years in order to actually be able to retire which is even crazier than the 800 000 stat if you're making that much money in New York I'm getting a remote job ASAP and moving to you know uh West Virginia or Florida I'd rather if I'm just making a W-2 income I'd rather live like a king in Florida than live like a plebe in New York and be in the rat race so get out that's what I that's what I would do yeah people always talk about um you know the big city and all that stuff but big fish small pond uh you know that is a a a uh what do we call a small pond syndrome you want to have small pond syndrome that that is a much more better way to live now of course there's no there's no end to that you could go live you could be at the top one percent in uh Thailand with probably like I don't know 120 Grand so so you know there's no there's no end to that but it definitely just shows how much of a ripoff California and New York are and uh I think I say this you live in New York half the year and I live in California the full year so you know who are we to say but like Charlottesville pretty nice Boise Charlottesville not bad no this time of year yeah lovely this time of year the Land of Lincoln it's beautiful uh honestly like places like California you're like oh wow that's a lot but then you scroll down you're like South Carolina 500 000 man like Idaho 508 000 really like you gotta like why why would that be why would that be so high and um they're not they're not bringing enough assets to the table or as you like to say you got to have some attributes at least California's got the oceans it's got the weather it's got this you know the scenery it's got the celebrities it's got whatever you want Silicon Valley Hollywood you gotta have some attributes if you're gonna be gonna be demanding this level of income up to be in the top one have you ever been to Flora Bama in Georgia you know what that is Flora Bama I'm sorry Flora Bama in in Alabama you know you know so we're Alabama and in the Florida Line meets this is where we would go for our Island grew up in Missouri all Missouri people go to Florida for spring break you go to Flora-Bama it's the Line This is the MTV show right yeah it's the it's the redneck Riviera my friend it is the trashiest place on Earth and it is so fun you could eat popcorn shrimp all day for four dollars Flora Bama is the place to go you get those Alabama prices while being on the basically the Florida coast it's all right I actually think there should be a Pitch competition like Shark Tank that's just cities or states just doing what you just did be like you ever wanted to wake up and have shrimp because we we do that here right like you're tired of not having shrimp before 10 a.m because that's not a problem in the in the the redneck Riviera fried popcorn shrimp grouper for dinner it's the best man Florida's the place to be you don't have to own socks it's the best man no shirt no shoes no problem I'm all about the floor Bama it's like yeah I took one look at you it's like how much longer do you want to live as a New York five because you could be in Idaho nine it was one plane ticket baby and so I I feel like every city should have to make their pitch as to why a 20-something year old should move there and live there that a 25 year old I might create a whole new show around just this just this pitch yeah man we need some uh we need uh Alaska to sponsor this pod um all right I think that's it right that's it [Music] foreign

his company which is called tiny which buys businesses it's going public and Andrew owns roughly 71 percent of the shares and it's going public at a nearly billion dollar valuation who knows what it's going to actually trade at but if it trades out what they wanted to trade at that's about 700 to 800 million dollars that Andrew will have from all starting with a bootstrap agency and I want to walk through his journey and I think this is amazing it's pretty mind-blowing [Music] foreign let's do it I'm um fancy shirt fancy shirt all I gotta say is fancy shirt I now do this thing where if somebody does anything that's like I feel like they left the house today feeling good about that or they you know they got a haircut I'm not subtle about it I'll just I act like a like a dog barking I'm just like nice haircut you got you you changed your face the thing that the audience is gonna call me out on is I I couldn't find my other glasses do I have to wear these glasses the problem with them is that [ __ ] Jeffrey Dahmer decided to wear the same ones yeah so it looks like I'm gonna ask you like do you want to come back to the apartment to take some tasteful pictures and have some beers like they'll be real nice like that he ruined it for me some people are into that I have a meaty one another publicly traded company this is a big deal and it kinda has not been made a big deal in the media because it's I guess not that big a deal to them it's a billion dollar company but basically our friend Andrew Wilkinson friend of the Pod friend of ours we're going to be with him in Vancouver on February 16th so if you want to come see us uh live he basically and by the way I got a preference this now that he's a publicly traded company everything that I'm going to say I just Googled it this is all just from Google I didn't ask him anything and a lot of it's guesses but not all of it he basically had a company that was publicly traded called we Commerce and it was not doing great it like peaked at like 500 million went down to 80 million anyway he's doing a reverse takeover no sorry he's doing a merge and he's his company which is called tiny which buys businesses it's going public and Andrew owns roughly 71 of the shares and it's going public at a nearly billion dollar valuation who knows what it's going to actually trade at but if it trades out what they wanted to trade at that's about 700 to 800 million dollars that Andrew will have from all starting with a bootstrap agency and I want to walk through his journey and I think this is amazing it's pretty mind-blowing okay the by the way the billion dollars is this uh one problem by the way is that all of his numbers were in Canadian dollars it was all CAD instead of USD so is this a billion CAD or is this a billion USD everything I'm gonna say is Canadian and I don't know what the conversion rate is of Monopoly money to USD but like it's it's somewhere close enough that we're still in the same ballpark yeah so I think it's I think it's a little bit more like 700 million is the the number that basically just discounted something like 20 30 yeah Andrews and CAD is Canadian Andrews and Canada if you ever really want to inflate something right like if you're five nine you're you're 511 CAD so just just go Cad and you'll you know get that extra get that little extra that you feel you've been missing your whole life so dude this story it's really impressive Andrew comes on the Pod and we mess with them but like this is we treat him like he's one of us what he's pulled off is like not one of us man it's pretty epic he's actually more like 20 of us he's the Brian scalabrini of Rich guys you know what I mean like this is the skellage he's the worst billionaire I know but he's the best millionaire I know yeah for sure I mean he's killing it so listen to this so basically the company that is taking public at this point has and this now this stuff is actually uh public uh it's doing about 150 million in Revenue 50 million in ebitda and so here's the story so 2006 Andrew was I think 19. he started a web design agency called meta lab and meta lab is like the core of all this in year one it had 250 000 in revenue and basically what he's doing is he's doing like design stuff so one of his big famous clients was before slack was slack Stuart Butterfield he you know reached out to Andrew said hey help me design slack and like I don't know it's web interfacing which frankly I don't even know entirely the the whole scope of that work but like more than logos but including logos I believe right more than logos that should be their tagline no it was definitely we draw good we draw good plus more logos and more uh no it was it was web interfacing so it was actually fairly technical but in year one it did too 250 000 in Revenue with a 50 profit margin in the year uh 2019 so three years in it was doing about a couple hundred thousand in profit and it doubled uh for a couple years and then grew by 30 a year so 2012 you're six years in only three million in Revenue not like right crazy out of this league like you know he's he's kind of like what people say about us is you're relatable and whatever people say that I was like you're so authentic you're so relatable I'm like what I like about you guys is you're not successful yeah and you're pretty dumb so it just feels good you guys yeah and so that's exactly how I feel so he was relatable so in year six three million in Revenue but after that it grows 30 a year which but which if you add up 30 annual growth by 2020 you're at something like 20 million in Revenue by 2023 you're in like the 40 or 50 range and the reason why Andrew's agency works so well is and I actually think this won't work this doesn't work as much anymore is he's based out of Victoria uh I don't even I'm such I'm so ignorant I don't even know what state Providence Minnesota but a little higher yeah yeah yeah he's in like yeah he's in like the Boise of Canada yeah upper Idaho I guess foreign [Music] have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better and so what that means is he's paying those wages but he's charging Silicon Valley pre British Columbia Ben just corrected me there you go British Columbia whatever that is uh I don't know what pset is on the Monopoly board but it's somewhere around there and so he's charging Silicon Valley prices to like the slacks of the world so these high-end prices but he's paying Canadian wages so that margin is fat and so that's why he's able to take make all this uh profit and he starts taking his profit and he starts launching companies and it doesn't work so well he launches one little software company uh I forget what it was called flow I think it was basically like an a Sonic competitor doesn't work out he's like I invested too much money goes [ __ ] this what if I just buy a company he reads a book on Warren Buffett and he's like yeah yeah I could do this and that's his new hero he turns into a buffet guy and he starts buying businesses and he buys a couple that are doing okay but then he buys one that becomes like the Crown Jewel this whole business so this whole thing tiny there's I think there's two crown jewels there's meta lab which we can guess is doing 40 or 50 million in Revenue 20 million in profit that's the cash flow engine of this whole thing of being able to buy these companies then he buys uh dribble which is basically like GitHub for designers so designers go to this website and they upload their portfolios other people can share your portfolio you send it to employers they can comment you get inspiration whatever now I don't have all the details on this but I if I had to guess dribble was launched by two Founders who weren't very business savvy and it had a lot of traffic but they're like dude we don't know how to like make money off this and Andrew buys it from them I imagine if I had a guess I bet you he buys it for five to ten million dollars turns this thing into a behemoth making now it's making many tens of millions of dollars if I had to guess it's worth 200 million dollars or higher I'm this is just pure guess and that becomes a crown jewel of this company tiny and so now he's got these two agencies or a meta lab and dribble and then he also has now what do they own like 15 other companies and he's taking it public and throughout this whole period he's bootstrapping this thing So Meta lab is the one that's paying for everything he's hires a CEO to run meta lab and because of that he basically owns like 90 of meta lab and now he owns what did I say 70 of these tiny shares and then his other partner in the business owns like 10 so him and Chris is his partner own 80 of this publicly traded company that's hoping to go public in the billion dollar range this is just a crazy fascinating story and uh I can't believe he's pulled this off yeah I got to be careful what I say because I invested in tiny recently when it was Private um so I kind of know more of the numbers but I don't know what's public versus what was Private am I the ballpark of everything yeah I think you're in the ballpark um I think the maybe the dribble valuation maybe a little bit High um but you're right that those two things make up like you know It's like because I guess here's my here's where this kind of broke for me and this is maybe not that interesting just my personal framework broken a good way in a good way which was uh I thought he'd been around doing this for way longer it was actually 2016 when he started like buying other companies and um that's not that long ago like we we met him in I don't know I met him in I want to say 2020. you know that's only four years in and it was but I would note about him he was like a personality yeah exactly like he always had this like cool looking Avatar his pictures always look cool he was like a designer so his hair was always slicked back and he had this like where we all looked like dorks he was like kind of good looking in his pictures and stuff like that yeah it just shows what a good head of hair could do for you and um you know I think that's the real takeaway number one um number two number two this segment is brought to you by hymns number three uh no so so I think that that was the first thing which was wow this was actually built up in a a relatively like on one hand it's a long period of time because he's been started metal lab a long time ago so that part you got to give credit for the oh wow 2006 and then he grinded it out year after year building the service business up but on the other hand the portfolio side of things was relatively new so I thought that was really interesting the second thing I assumed that the portfolio was a lot more a lot flatter a lot more parody so maybe like there were um you know five to ten companies all of sort of equal value pitching in each one like you know five to ten percent of the overall value of the pie and that's how you get like you know 70 or something like that and the rest is meta lab and in fact it was kind of like like a venture portfolio in a way where a couple of the companies were really the standout ones that were driving most of the value and I think for them it was actually three there was the the one they took they originally took public so we Commerce which is basically their Shopify apps roll up uh so the Shopify app roll-up I think was was one winner dribble is another winner in meta Labs another winner and to me everything else is nice but now that those are such big Winners that they make up so much revenue and so much ebitda that the others are almost like rounding errors at the moment uh that's a little bit harsh I would say but you know so maybe that's maybe that's a little too harsh but just comparatively it wasn't like this portfolio of a dozen equally sized companies um which maybe was I never should have assumed that in the first place but when you hear somebody's doing a portfolio you sort of think okay it's going to be sort of more smoothly distributed out but but it was actually a little bit more concentrated in a few key key winners that just really kept compounding at a high rate and um so yeah so I think that's that's amazing I think what he's done is amazing like um to build this level of a of a sort of empire in this short of amount of time is uh it's pretty awesome and the biggest thing is I love that he did it his way like there really wasn't anybody doing exactly what he was doing um of course there's private Equity right but he wasn't doing it like private Equity because he wasn't looking to flip he's looking to buy and hold so then you have sort of okay okay who's doing permanent Equity who's doing a buy and hold strategy okay there's some people doing it but they all raised money he used his own company's profits to do it so that's pretty dope and then he branded it and was more public about it versus these kind of more under the radar it's like oh you you're part of like Maple Oak Capital what is that you know I go to your website it's got two lines it just says we acquire software companies and it's like okay I I don't know what this means whereas he built kind of like a sexy brand out of it so I think there was a bunch of things he did that were pretty cool like even his term sheet he's like oh I read that Warren Buffett basically you know we'll meet a company understand it and then write a one sheet a one-page you know like term sheet for them to just you know are they gonna take this deal or not he doesn't do this like complicated lawyer process if he can buy a billion dollar company with with a one or two pager then I should be able to buy this three million dollar company with a one-pager and so he took you know he took that approach and I think did a good job branding what he was doing along the way yeah and so here's a few more takeaways and then I want to hear yours uh if you have any extra ones the first is that you said that he did this quickly yeah kinda but he also did it really slowly the Acquisitions part only yeah the acquisition part but he basically started in 2006 and then he didn't really hit his stride until 2016. so that's 10 years of having an agency now he didn't run the agency the whole time he ran up for a little while and then he also hired people and so I'm I'm sure he was managing it to some extent but slow is good in some cases and the second thing is that he didn't raise money for an agency and because of that he had so much Freedom the second you raise money that that your cap table is one of the few things that you can't reverse or it's really hard and he didn't raise money for a company that meta Labs should not have raised money and it did not raise money and because of that he was able to use the profits to invest in [ __ ] versus if you raise money they're like no don't use those profits to do other things reinvest them and make this thing bigger the next thing is financial maneuvering like you know I joke that I like don't know anything about finances it's kind of uh like his like thing I think I think he's built that skill up over time right didn't didn't know it initially but but yeah has he can create a lot of value a lot of people do this now they can create a lot of value by increasing their financial IQ like um taking we Commerce public via SPAC in 2020 when the timing was perfect um required some combination of being prepared with a good business secondly uh you know identifying the timing and saying now is the time go aggressively and third is like just having the financial IQ to go with the balls to be able to actually go pull something like that off 100 the next thing is where you live it can actually matter a lot now I think that this gap of Silicon Valley wages and Victoria Canada wages might be closed a little bit it's closer at least than it was before that Gap is smaller but this still exists in other places I know I have friends that have built pretty big businesses are building them right now noun they're using Indian Talent versus American talent and they're getting great products so you do with this podcast [Laughter] guilty and then the final thing is hiring and negotiating the way he negotiated with his CEOs and kept them happy while also retaining Equity so I don't know like how he pays people I I imagine he pays them with just tons of cash so that's like you're like well that's easy you just pay over pay people but anyway it's still like really impressive I was able to negotiate and hire and manage people I've heard from a bunch of his CEOs where they're like when things are going fine I don't ever hear from them and I love that and then of course I imagine there's times when things aren't going fine he's like all right dude come on we gotta we gotta like push this a little harder but he's done a really good job of hiring and uh anyway this whole thing that he's pulled off I messaged him and I was like this sounds like an insult yeah we gotta clap we'll clap for him I was like dude this sounds like it this sounds like an insult but do you ever just sit with like a shit-eating grin and just laugh at like a little evil laugh and be like got him I pulled off this paper because that's kind of what it feels like because he makes it look easy and of course it's never easy there's like there's times where he'll message me he's like dude I feel like I'm in the dumps or I feel overwhelmed he's human but he's done a really good job of doing it his way almost to the point where I'm like dude you got to be smirking right now like it's that feeling like when you get successful and you think of all your ex-girlfriends who like made fun of you it's like you you [ __ ] it you have with like the names of all your enemies marked on like champagne bottles do you like when you pop that cork off whatever you like a lock of their hair and you just set it a fire with the lighters yeah dude what are you talking about but he's pulled it off he's let me let me let me also say another thing you know that um there are people that are masters of engineering you know people that are um you know fantastic leaders but you know I'm the dawn of Storytelling and Andrew is a great Storyteller so people should go read his dribble 2.0 blog post it's on medium so uh just Google dribble 2.0 Andrew Wilkinson and here okay Sam how do most people announce an acquisition um go just just uh give me your generic thing yeah it's like uh we're so bra we are so we're so so we're so pleased they built a really nice business and we're happy to be stewards of this business and we're really looking forward to the future and then like the sellers like you know we were looking for a nice home Foreigner and we're excited for the future just nonsense no absolute absolute soulless dribble so here's here's what he he didn't said so here's I'm just gonna read a little snippet of this because I think people should pick up on the storytelling too I think that helps so he goes when I first started meta lab Dan cedarholm was my hero a great opening line a great one because I don't know who this guy is and now I'm like why is this person your hero he goes this bulletproof web was the first book I read I used to reverse engineer his style sheets on simple bits to learn his CSS tricks anything he did I did and I drove my front end developers nuts trying to get them to implement every little one pixel detail that I learned from Dan so already you're like okay this is interesting he's basically setting the context of like that's the guy who started dribble and he's like it's not just I bought dribble and I'm pleased to to you know raise prices in six months he's like you know I uh I've admired this guy this guy's my hero I learned from him and so when he uh so here so let me uh keep going so he goes I remember I remember meeting another favorite designer Dave Dave Shea at a conference back in 2008. he mentioned that he knew Dan my floor my jaw Hit the Floor wait what the CSS drop Shadows the cork logo he's the best what's he like I was gushing um blah blah I wasn't just a fanboy I was his web standards Fanboy uh blah blah blah then he keeps going he goes one of the projects that Dan did was dribble which he co-founded with whoever uh I had used it blah blah blah which is why I'm excited I'm saying I'm excited to share the big news right so just that little paragraph of setup it draws you in in a way that like he could have just done a standard boring eye roll press release and instead he decided to do it this way and then he he talks about kind of like that it wasn't just like therefore we've acquired it and it's done he's like I was bugging him and bugging him I kept emailing them every month asking them if they would let me in he's like this September my Moxie finally paid off he emailed me saying they would think to do they might do it they cared about these three things I wouldn't mess it up I have a long-term View and I want them to stay involved and own a piece of the business we shook hands and made a deal um blah blah blah and then he tells the rest of the you know then he then he does the standard stuff about we're excited it's going to be great and um I just thought that was just a way better way of doing it than the average person would do it and if you add up a lot of doing things better than the average person would do it you end up with this type of exceptional outcome it it's just great man I I have a lot of respect from them there there's always like this little bit of Envy in me uh when I talk to Andrew because he's my friend and uh I consider us peers and but then then he'll make jokes about like what he's doing on the weekend and then like oh that's sick and uh and then but I'm proud of him I feel like I feel I feel a lot of Pride like on his full kind of for him and I'm very happy that he's pulled this off and I think it's really impressive and I think that it's badass that people are that there are people that are bold enough to do things their way regardless of what the Nerds invest in from Stanford tell you the way you should do it and I imagine that along the way he got a lot of flack making fun of him from being in Canada uh for not raising money for buying these little quote little things and I guess that's the [ __ ] name of the company tiny but he just like pulled it off and I appreciate that gumption and I appreciate that boldness and I find it inspiring and I'm happy that like we have him in our life so that's my little love note to Andrew good job love letter to Andrew Wilkinson yeah and if you wanna we're going to Canada we're going to be there February 16th and Andrew if you're listening to this you want to fly us up there private that's cool if you want to celebrate we know how much money you have now so yeah look let's celebrate my favorite one friend invite another over yeah yeah let's celebrate by flying private together except we'll be like you don't have to be there and Sean and I will each be in different planes uh so can we have an allowance can you just send us a card with just an allowance that would be tight um anyway that's my breakdown of tiny he deserved it dude I got roasted so badly by my daughter uh last night I was like oh man this is your four-year-old daughter arrested you so badly nice three three years old we played so so she she can't play mini games we play um rock paper scissors but she always throws scissors so that's like you know fun for for her not for me um she plays hide and seek always hides in the same spot that's why kids do this they just like play the game but they don't know how to play and then she so that so I taught her I Spy I was like oh here's a game we could play in the car um I spy and so she loves I spy so she so I'm like I spy something green she's like is it the tree I'm like how'd you get it it's almost the tree that's right and she goes I spy something yellow and I'm like looking around the house I'm like what is it yellow I don't see anything yellow she goes your teeth it's gonna she's not aware that that's the sickest burn and that anybody's here to anybody hey I smile an [ __ ] yeah exactly I was like wow that is just like natural that's a natural burn can I tell you about something cool that you probably know about and I saw it and I can't stop thinking about it have you heard of the scallenge I don't know about this tell me about this all right this is you know I don't pay attention to sports this is your league so uh you know you know Brian is Brian oh oh scalabrini okay I didn't know he called it the scallenge that's a good name well explain who he is people don't know probably so Brian uh scalabrini he played for the Celtics he's like a redhead he's six nine he's huge but I think he looks like uh Will Ferrell but actually was an MB NBA player yeah so easy to make fun of but I think he was like okay right or was he always yeah he he was okay but then like it was okay but he was he didn't take himself too seriously and over time you know like he had a kind of a few years where he actually played but most of his career he's on the bench as a scrub and uh yeah yeah bar shops his nickname Kobe was the Black Mamba he started calling himself The White Mamba and so you know he was a goofy dude who was basically a benchwarmer for like the last whatever seven years of his career uh but was a great you know great locker room presence and and you know a warm body so people kept him around and I think at one point he called himself I don't know if it's a joke or what the worst player in the NBA obviously was a joke but anyway after he retired so I guess he retired from the NBA somewhat recently ish but he's still six nine and athletic and whatever or athletic for uh you know he's a basketball player but compared to the other guys he wasn't like that athletic but he starts playing Rec leagues and like he would score you know record leads like at the YMCA and on uh playgrounds and he scores like 60 points a game you know just crushing these guys and he doesn't like brag about it too much but then like online at one point he mentions like yeah I got 60 points last night at my reckley and then just people online just start chirping at him hard and they're like dude you suck I could beat you or you I don't even know how you made it in the NBA you know yada yada yada they start chirping at him and he goes wait a minute no I maybe suck compared to Derrick Rose but I don't suck compared to any of you guys and so he starts doing this tour where he goes to like uh all these basketball courts he goes I want to go to the the the the hoodess of the hood basketball court I want to go to the best YMCA I wanna I'll go all around the country and he starts doing this and he crushes these guys and he challenges people he says come play me one-on-one do you think I suck come play me one-on-one yeah and he and he destroys them and there's he he's like I'm not even gonna do this for social media but some people recorded a couple of these things that he would beat them like 10 nothing he was like I let him get one point just to figure out what they're gonna do but I just destroy these guys and he's got this awesome quote that he goes he said this to like one of the kids it was like an 18 year old kid who like plays against him in any any and he crushes this kid he goes let's get something straight I'm closer to LeBron than you are to me and I thought I read that and I go this is the greatest thing I've ever heard this is awesome it's such a good story and he called it the scallenge and I thought it was so good it just shows you know there's levels to Greatness yeah there's levels to this I think it's the perfect the perfect takeaway from that and also he's hilarious he is so good um I don't remember this by the way we were when we did our our camp MFM get away um the the guy who came to train us he's he trains like a bunch of NBA stars so he trains Kyrie Irving he's changed Trey young and so he was there and his wife is in the WNBA and uh she's like one of the best players in the WNBA we're talking about the WNBA and how like their you know the players are awesome but they also don't get like high viewership it's like not like the league doesn't do that well it's kind of like subsidized by the NBA it kind of loses money but you know it it's good overall for the sport for there to be a women's league and so we were like yeah well we had kind of a impromptu brainstorm of like the same thing everyone says which is can I beat her up you know like it's like when everyone says wait a bunch of drunk and he gets that Buffalo Wild Wings are watching like Rosemary Eunice and like these female UFC fighters everyone thinks it can I kick her ass yeah what would happen if I fought her yeah exactly uh so basically we did a brainstorm like what would you do to get ratings up or to like if you were to launch a different women's league like how would you get people interested because the problem is I think I saw this this crazy Tick Tock it was like some team whoever won the championship last year I have no idea maybe it's like the Atlanta Dream or something like that and they came home to do their parade in the city and it literally just looked like you know if I walk to my bus stop here and there's like three people kind of loitering around there's like a bum and then you know that was the parade there was nobody there for the parade and the the team was going down on the bus and it was just like other people were like why is this what is this why is this bus here what oh do you guys play a sport I didn't really realize that so this is Tick Tock that went viral making fun of it um and yeah the idea that that we all landed on was basically the three or four three four five best players should basically go on tour like it's the and one mixtape tour and go City to city and challenge you know any five you know go play pickup with any with dudes at any of these and live stream that um or like cut that into clips of them basically punking punking guys yeah like beating guys who think they could beat them and uh yeah put some respect on their name so so that was kind of the marketing idea but yeah to our if the CMO of the WMA is listening you're welcome dude I love these challenges there's another one where like uh when you're watching running running's not a popular sport but I love it it's my favorite sport to watch uh next to the UFC and the people were like they're not that they're like a two-hour Marathon do you remember that when the guy elude he ran two hours and he just looks so smooth he looks closer to an animal than he does a human like his body is just like he just you know running 100 miles a week for probably 20 years he's just like his you look at his Cavs and you're like I I can't believe that you and I are like the same we're both humans it's just it's not even fair he looks graceful when he runs he looks beautiful and he doesn't look that fast and so they put a treadmill at the same speed and they go here's here's because he's dealing with ease he's doing it with ease and he does it for two hours and they go see if you can do this for 15 seconds and they have this treadmill and like people can't do it for just 20 seconds they can't even run that speed it's basically like four minutes and 30 seconds a mile which is like I don't know would that be like 60 miles from sprinting for me yeah yeah yeah yeah it's like a Sprint and um it's a Sprint for most people and uh it was really funny no one could keep up with it so I love these like that's actually one of the tenets of making content viral which is it made you have to make something made to stick and you can make it stick by comparing it to real tangible things that everyone can understand and when you put one of these treadmills at that speed you're like oh I can't keep up with that for 10 seconds let alone two hours totally totally somebody said this about the Olympics they go the Olympics there should be one civilian in every event and just a normal fit guy from the gym and it should just be like just as a baseline comparison here's the average person and you know here's even like an above average person and then here's the Olympians like let them all just let them line up in lane 11. and see what happens dude I would love that I would love that I have uh I've got I've got a big meaty topic what do you have all right so I this is a story of a multi-millioned easily multi-million pop Ben type in the chat do the calculation how much I I lost doing this let's see I would have invested at a company at 5 million and it's now a three billion ish company um so you know I I basically turned I missed out on a chance to probably turn something like 25k into tens of millions of dollars yeah um okay so here's what happened but it's kind of there's kind of some some interesting things baked into this so it's not just that oh I missed a big deal uh everybody misses misses opportunities this is uh an interesting one so back in 2015 uh which is kind of when we met um I was not a angel investor but I liked the idea I thought it sounded cool I was a founder of of a company uh and I was making I think 100 160 Grand a year it's 160 Grand a year back then you told me you're making 160 and I was like oh you're the richest person I know I remember you told me you're making 150 000 I was like oh my God yeah I I remember I was like man find a find somebody who looks at me the way Sam looks at me right now by the way that Sam looks at my pay stub and so um so yeah I I was making 160 a year but in in California you know you're kind of after taxes now you're at like 110 you're netting you know and then you pay for life it's pretty expensive blah blah blah you don't save much so I didn't have much of a bankroll but I like the idea of being an angel investor and people because our office was so dope when a Founder would come they would think that I'm a lot richer than I was but just because our office was so fancy which was only fancy because our main investor owned the building and decked it out for himself and like that's why the office was so fancy it had nothing to do with me so anyways I um I meet this kid we're building a product and I meet this kid he's 13 years old and he uses our app every day our app was like a clubhouse type of app he used to use it every day after school come home use the app and he's hanging out in the Silicon Valley chat rooms and we're like dude you should be like going and go try to have a kiss like you know that should be your mission not like sitting in on this room talking about raising your series a and um and so two things happened one he's like dude I want to come work with you guys whatever we're like dude you're in Middle School like I can't your parents are gonna kill me I can't help you work for us if I go here's here's what you can do he goes I want to be a scout for you I said okay go ahead okay it'd be a scout for me he goes um he goes he goes what do you want me to do I go every week I want you to send me a company that you think is awesome and that you think I should invest in and just write why you think I should invest and send me the company now I have zero hope or really even zero plan to read this email at the time I'm just basically giving this kid a homework assignment I'm like yeah this will help you think and most likely this is going to be too much work for you you might do it once you might do it twice but you're gonna give up by the third time for sure so I give him this homework assignment very first company he sends me he is a company called apply board and so here's uh this was the second this is sorry this is the second week hey Sean here's the second company I want to introduce apply board what they do they help International students find the right University for themselves and apply there on their behalf they have 11 schools contracted to pay them a commission for ever uh for a student that gets that signs up and they have 14 more schools in the funnel they have over 1500 students signed up 160 000 Facebook likes and this is all with ten dollars in paid marketing this is actually pretty interesting right like that's actually a kind of a a really good analysis and that's you know simple two lines so I'm like wow this kid's 13 he's like you know he's this is a good find and he's explained it well he goes why you should invest now this is where he got a little off but that's okay he goes they started four years ago with offline Consulting and then pivoted into a software business they know the space well they have four co-founders they have a very very diverse skill set blah blah um they have an algorithm something something and he says um their customer acquisition costs only a few dollars the LTV is a thousand so they have sustainable growth uh he goes I'm trying to correct my shots so that one day I could hit the bullseye for you if you have any feedback on the company I would love to hear it because the first one I didn't even respond I said like this is bad um so this is his second one and I'm like you know what this is actually pretty good I'm gonna take this meeting so guy is in San Francisco he comes to my office love him super Charming this guy Martin um you you've probably met like a bunch of these guys who are like there's something that's really just like uh I don't know charismatic or charming about dudes from like you know Israel or something like that like anyone is like Israel Persian turkey there's like it's like there's just so goddamn Charming like they're just dripping with sauce and what it's Cliff's company effortless what's our booty Cliff Cliff W uh Cliff uh Weitzman yeah um it's the audio one I I think he's uh Middle Eastern I met him uh when when he was just starting and I was like it he had oh he's Israeli actually uh he had that same Vibe and in the office I go what's interesting about you or something and he goes I can do a backflip I go all right well yeah my friends yeah I said uh all right well uh move that chair over there's enough room here go do it and he did a backflip in the middle of my office and uh his company now speechify it's it's in the Unicorn territory and I didn't invest in it but that like he had that same Charisma when he came to my office he lit up the room I should have I should have known better yeah he's got amazing energy and uh and so yeah this is the so so he so I meet this guy he's got the Israeli swag I'm loving it and then and again I have never at this point I've never Angel invest in a company but I'm like this seems like a great idea and what they're why this is a great idea for people to know it's kind of a effed up part of the system which is colleges in the U.S just have like surge pricing for international students so it's basically like if I'm a if I'm a state resident I get like cheaper tuition at State schools okay but if I'm a U.S resident I pay you know what I thought is full price so maybe I'll pay 25k uh to go to school at this place but an international student will have to pay two or three times more than that so they'll pay 50 to 75 000 for the same exact thing they just charge them more it's kind of insane I don't really know even how they are able to justify this but they do and um and so you remember in San Francisco University was that what it's called University of San Francisco I I dated a girl that went like had ties there and I remember walking around campus and it was only Chinese students and it's and it's not even good schools like Universe San Francisco or USF or whatever it's not even that good of a school and so it's actually it's actually a bit of a trick it's like um International students just want to come to America they can't differentiate between uh you know University of Utah and you know um you know Colombia or whatever like these different schools they don't know the the lay of the land that well they don't know that the school's in the middle of nowhere they don't know that it's not actually considered that prestigious or whatever it is it's just expensive uh so it's actually a lot of these other schools that really take advantage of this and have a huge percentage of their population coming from International which makes up a disproportionate amount of Revenue so that's kind of like why the schools are interested so they went to him and they were like yeah we'll give you three thousand dollars if you can get somebody to sign up he's like three thousand dollars oh that's pretty good and I think now they take a lot more than I think that now they take you know ten percent or something of the of the overall tuition so it's gone up since then but um anyways so he pitches and I'm like dude I just get yeah I get caught up I like the idea I love this guy's personality I'm like I'm in he's like you're in I'm in he said fantastic I haven't really talked to anybody else yet uh so I don't know all the round details I said brother I'm in and uh he's like all right love it you're you're the first guy met in Silicon Valley you're my champion on this and I thought I'm the first guy he's been oh wait hold on I didn't really want to be the first guy in like you know first at the dance floor is kind of like not not exactly the position to be in so then he goes on tour he goes starts pitching people and he starts coming back to me with and he he's a nice dude he's honest guys trust me he says man they're saying no because of this and I'm like oh these guys are idiots don't worry about them they don't get it next one they came back they said no because of this and as by the third one I'm like maybe I should have been saying no so I start to doubt my uh my conviction in this thing but I'm still like brother I told you I'm in so I'm in and uh anyways it takes them a little time if the edit the story is you backed out on him and you were calling him brother in fact I think he was calling me brother because that was like you know it's like the khabib thing where they just they just say brother a lot uh you just knifed him in the back well I didn't actually knife him in the back I don't know I don't know exactly what I don't know I don't remember exactly how it played out but I definitely uh worst out so so basically takes them a little time to raise the round he eventually does get the round together and I'm supposed to write a 25k check not even like some crazy amount of money but to me at that time that was like it's like all right well that's kind of like my entire like savings for this year is going to go to this one random Israeli guys company all right uh you know I I could lose this but I would really hate to lose this and I start thinking about you know am I ready for this I don't know and so I kind of just I don't back out but I don't uh from what I remember I didn't back out but I didn't reach back out either and so I think he probably emailed me once I was like yeah okay let me know when it's time and then he probably emailed me like three or four weeks later I was like yo it's time and I just like didn't reply to that thing and I I don't think anything really happened but anyways long story short I don't invest um fast forward you know five years I get an email from that same kid saroosh and sarush is like hey remember this email yeah plyboard's a unicorn now huh and uh you know what do you know curious what you think about that and I was like I think I was an idiot and I I think it was a total idiot and there's actually a few kind of like takeaways in this for me so the few takeaways are one um don't be a wuss if you say you're gonna do something just do it that's just a lesson for myself and I think you know for most people uh yourself included that's that's rarely a problem for me that's more of a problem second um I actually think I was correct that I was not ready to be Angel Investing at the time um and so I should have either could have done like a five thousand dollar Check Yes exactly so what I should have done is I should have said all right look I don't have the bankroll to place 20 bets which is kind of what you'll need you need 20 to 30 bets for you know Angel Investing to work and so it's like you know I don't I don't realistically I do not have the bankroll to do this but that's okay that doesn't mean I don't do what I want it means I got to be resourceful and find a way so either let me come in at a smaller check size that make it's my version of you know if an angel investor writes 25k when they have five million dollars then I need to write the proportional check for me and see what happens or I should have gone to somebody and said hey I actually found this deal I think it's really good you have the money uh which is what I did later with Lambda school it was like hey I like this company uh they haven't really raised much money yet it's not proven but like I think it's worth a shot and I convinced somebody else to write the check and give me some carry so that's really what I should have done to make this happen but at the time my fear overrode my like um you know the the uh not even ego the fear overrode my like uh ability to think like from Earth just think like with a clear head and say okay well sounds like there's just a little obstacle here and let's figure out how we're gonna get around it a lot of people are embarrassed they're saying like well can I do five thousand like I remember doing a deal I I did a deal for 15 or 25 000 when I didn't have a lot of money thankfully on paper it's turned into a bit but I remember thinking like I want to ask them if I could do 5K but I don't want to look like a punk right yeah so so I think I I should have found a way and that's I think uh has been a common theme in my life which is like a lot of good opportunities come my way and I say I don't have the time I don't have the money I don't have the skill I don't have whatever and I rule it out even though objectively I'm like this is a great opportunity and the real answer is find a way to get the time or find somebody who does have the time find a way to get the money or find somebody who has the money to help you out right like do do one of those things to get there uh and this is not like a small thing like just doing the difference between doing that and not doing that would have been again tens of millions of dollars in this case when in the result case where it worked out so that's one takeaway the second is this guy's saroosh is like now become a general strategy for me which is I always want to have like I don't know four or five people who are kind of like way it's like an anti-mentor all right like you know it's a mentee or something like that right it's like I want to have people that are young hungry and ignorant and naive uh but that's an asset for them because they're young and hungry uh I want to have them more in my Orbit and I need to find some excuse to have them in my Orbit and hang out with them and hear what they think is interesting and meet their friends and whatever like that is um you know I think that is an actual strategy that most people miss out on everybody wants to to sort of climb up they're like oh how do I meet the person who's done more than me or is more successful than me has more money than me whatever and they're focused constantly on like reaching up and trying to like pull themselves up and instead I found so much benefit out of just having a crew a small crew of like 18 to 21 year olds that I'm like okay you guys just think differently to me you're worried about different things and um you're excited about different things than me how do I have that in my life in some way and so that's actually become a more core strategy do you do anything like that yeah so listen to this so we had this kid by the way thank you for not making like an uh Epstein joke I felt like I was treading I was like what you need is like 14 year old dudes that you hang out with all the time it's like yeah no I I so I'm 33 I'm just now hitting the age where I'm no longer the youngest guy in the room and I'm just hitting the age where I've got 15 years or so of experience and I'm seeing younger people and I'm like oh you're full of energy you're going to do something but you're making an air here and I'm just gonna let I'm just going to watch you make that air because it's good for you I'm just now getting to the point where I'm able to be a little wise and I'm seeing the importance of surrounding ourselves with young people here's an example a year ago Sean and I did this thing where we offered five thousand dollars to someone who made a tick tock video from our podcast and shared it one kid in particular his name was Michael at the time he made these videos that reached tens of millions of people for us and we gave him the five grand and I went to email him and I was like dude you should do this full time and I asked him what his email and it was like you know Michael at University of michigan.edu and I was like wait who are you he goes yeah I just recorded this in my dorm room I'm like oh you're gonna be you're on to something you're gonna be a superstar just start throwing this into a company turns into a company uh I guess r5k was his first money he makes tens of thousands of dollars a month eventually sells it to morning Brew uh Michael what's Michael's last name I don't even know it's a can yeah and he comes over to my house and uses the studio and I just he'll mean Sarah will be in the kitchen and I'll just I go Mike come out to the kitchen have a coffee with me and me and Sarah won't say a word and we'll just let him talk and I'm just like I'm just here just because he's 22 maybe I'm like my kid should have some chocolate milk yeah yeah you want some hot cocoa lollipop yeah sit on my lap too while you're at it and like he just talks and about 60 of the stuff that he says is nonsense 40 absolute nonsense not just him anybody who fits this category you have to literally just immediately throw away 60 of the words but what I say to him I go Michael most of what you're saying is [ __ ] and I think you might know it but look here's the deal even a blind squirrel finds a nut a nut once in a while keep on swinging you'll hit a home run soon because you're swinging you're in the game and I appreciate that about you and if you ever want to know what you're saying is [ __ ] just ask me and I'll tell you but I'm not gonna call you yeah I'm gonna let you get away with it all because I I like I like this gumption and he tweeted something the other day that was hilarious he tweeted got bad news just got back from the chiropractor they said the chip on my shoulder is permanent how funny is that and I was like this is why you're gonna make something of yourself now you might ruin it by saying dub stuff and you're gonna cost yourself a whole lot of money and you're gonna have a lot of headache throughout the years until you learn to be calmer but you know he was feeling good about that line too when he tweeted but I appreciate that this is a young kid so I have I had he moved to Austin I invite him over all the time and I go just talk man just just just talk I want to hear what you got to say and he's telling me like and I'm just like learning about what like the younger generation feels about this and that and he's like yeah we're gonna he's like he has a birthday party coming up on Saturday and we're taking some like new weird version of uber I don't even know what it is like a party bus company I don't even know what it is but he's like this is what all this is what we're all using I was like all right cool I'm in I just want to experience this stuff so yes long story short I totally I am experiencing this where I have young people around me sounds weird but let's get past that strategy is a real strategy and uh and actually this is my reminder to myself I need to refresh my my young Bloods are now like 24 to 25 and Rich they're like made it like okay so Michael is one example um the other guys who set up our initial studios here and then created that uh agency clipped they've they do over a million dollars a year in Revenue off their off their thing and now their their content is going going nuts their short form videos are going nuts like millions of views um and I had to like reprimand reprimand Henry all the time I was like hey Henry just so you know you shouldn't talk like this when you're in this meeting or something and then eventually I was like you know I'm not going to give them advice I'm just going to let them learn but I saw the same thing where I'm like you're making a bunch of mistakes but you're taking a ton of swings you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna hit uh the kid I talked about saroosh uh probably has more money than me now from crypto the guy has made an absolute killing in crypto over the last few years and so done done incredibly well uh the guy who was my intern to start this podcast uh ishan who was just like doing the video editing and like created the initial brand name and all that stuff invest all of his money into like a short stock a short position on a penny no not a short not a short one he he went all in he took basically he had like 100 Grand safe up after a couple years of working for me and then for for a friend I introduced him to and he took the hundred grand and he just bought there was a stock that got delisted on a stock exchange so all the shareholders were like damn it what do we do with the stock that we can't trade anymore it's like illiquid and so he bought it all for like 10 cents on the dollar being like I don't know I still believe and then that ran up to be worth a few million dollars uh his his 100K basically turned into like a two to five million dollar stake at that time now I think down a little bit but um there's articles about him and the Australian post or whatever now and I'm like dude this is crazy who and another one Steve Bartlett uh hired Steve when I when he was uh 18 19 years old maybe maybe that's a little maybe maybe he's 20 at the time um and I was like this guy again just dripping with swag and I was like I just want to be around this guy this guy's like cool I don't know he wears like rings and he like says words I don't know and like for some reason he his tweets go viral uh I don't know like mine don't so like what does this guy know and sure enough ends up creating this social media agency ends up taking it public has this great podcast that's super popular he's a shark on the Shark Tank of Europe like this guy's like now he's like he's the black garyvee now and so it's like there's a it's like dude that's I just thought of six in the last 15 seconds like I don't even there might be even more that I'm not even remembering that or like come from the same batch and uh I need to I need a new batch my little personal YC this is good that you're talking about this so I was talking to a friend yesterday so uh producer Ben you can leave all this live but you're gonna have to uh bleep out what I'm about to say but I want Shawn to know what it is so um my friend I was talking to he said uh he he just mentioned it we were talking about something totally different and he was like yeah you know like you know I made 30 million dollars from an angel investment and um yeah you know so this is how I found my accountant I did this this because I was asking him for a good accountant and I was like like I'd be the rewind sound I was like like you know scratching the record reverse tell me about this like he goes yeah basically I was uh you know like president of like a smallish startup that wasn't doing so well and a 22 year old kid who worked for me he quit to start a company and I was you know frustrated at first but like he was real promising and so I invested 25 thousand dollars uh at a three million dollar valuation the company went public like a year or two ago and it was a 15 billion dollar valuation it was called a market cap it was called This is the part you got to bleep out it was called you know that company no but okay it's a boring nothing special like B2B whatever um and uh he he's like yeah I had 75 000 at the time uh when I was running my first startup I didn't have a lot of money but I decided to invest all of it into startups and I did it in sizes of 10 and 25 000 and that one check that I did of twenty five thousand dollars it turned into 30 million dollars um and and I was like are you kidding me he goes yeah basically like I knew this kid was strong and I wanted to be part of just whatever he was in I wanted to surround myself with young people and I thought he was promising and uh in fact it it worked out really well and I made so much money off of this one deal and he goes and then the other one he said made like a 10x return as well and you just got super lucky on that one and it totally worked out so it's crazy story and I'm like well I've invested in a bunch of companies I'm late for that to happen that'd be nice yeah exactly what part do I do for the 30 billion is there a line for that am I in the right line yeah yeah so it worked out it's a crazy story um that was good um all right I had another one but let's let's save it for the next uh let's save the next episode because it's getting a little long now all right that's the Pod I think that was a banger uh we forgot to remind people if you made it

I love how even though I tried to pick a non-nerdy data one it actually underneath the hood was a nerdy data one you're like the you're a data hammer and the whole world is just little nails that you're just trying to hammer with your you know like but dude this is the best business in the data like a vacuum you're the data Dyson that's just taking in this data from everywhere you can yeah [Music] man Founders are you like a lot of times not good at explaining what they do to idiots so can I do it can I so all right I'm gonna make you look cool I want to be your wingman all right so you run a I don't know if you call it software or a data business but people pay subscriptions and uh your your company CBN sites you're now getting close to 100 million a year in Revenue which is like a huge accomplishment hundreds of employees as well and basically and this is the part that's kind of hard to understand for someone like Sean and I because we haven't run like really really huge companies but basically when a company that has a thousand people have to decide what software they have to buy like let's say it's just like some customer support software or payroll or something they need to do tons and tons of research to make sure that the business that they're going to pick the vendor they're going to pick like will stay in business or will be around for 10 or 20 years things like that as well as a bunch of other information and you have crawled through what you call Dirty data so all this data out there exists but you just put it in a bit bits of software that make it really easy to digest and understand so a person can make a right and smart decision and they pay you like 30 or 50 or 150 000 a year to access all that is that right sounds about right yeah and more importantly fan of the show and prolific idea guy before this episode before we did this episode he sent over a Google sheet that is 77 rows of random startup ideas which just tells me you're you you are you're one of us and um so this is great you made our job really easy we have a bunch of ideas we can go through uh there's a few kind of interesting CV Insight stories that you've blogged about in the past I want to talk about but let's do those at the end because uh I think the ideas are going to be a lot more fun Sean one of the reasons why he's fun you said that he's one of us because the idea thing that's true he's also fun because even though he comes off like this like polite guy who's like uh introverted he's a [ __ ] a Nine's a [ __ ] his Twitter is hilarious he always he writes this famous newsletter to like 500 000 people now and he signs it with like I love you and in his Twitter the bio says um please buy a CB insights subscription I owe people money and like he always does like he kind of pokes the bear a bunch in his stuff so he's got the he's got a really cool attitude um but hopefully we'll get that out of you yeah yeah exactly yeah my kids were uh my kids were excited that you called me a [ __ ] so I appreciate that one you're welcome uh all right so here we go uh Sam you put your favorites on the street I put my favorites what's interesting to me is we have almost no overlap you uh only maybe two out of the ten that you put down there were my favorites I had completely different ones I'll tell you why I say we take turns where we say tell us about blah blah like the little the little three set three word tagline and he gets to pitch it and let's react and let's try to get through a bunch of these so we might go on random pan just or drill down but like let's in general try to go uh you know an inch deep on each one of these for now you want me to go first yeah you go so the reason why I highly basically everything I highlighted so CB insights interest me because basically you're not coming up with any data you're just organizing data that already exists and really easy to understand ways and then you're selling it at high fees and I think that's like the greatest business model on Earth and you've listed out a bunch of ideas including like six or seven that were more of these like data things data so you had one in there called sawdust data and you have examples you're like you can look at what the government does like the government has all this data you can make that clear and easier to understand for people um both the sawdust data as well as the government data products what do you mean by all that yeah so Solace data is people create products and sometimes the residue of that product is actually really interesting data right and so that's the sawdust from the data and so it's basically taking that exhaust and so I'll give you a couple of examples right you have I'll just and I don't know if these are businesses already but you know OpenTable and resi have all this reservation data I wonder if you could take that data exhaust and sell it to real estate firms right and they'd be you know hey like reservations are down this area is not as hot maybe this this retail space is going to be on the market soon because this restaurant looks like a dog right that might be one area you know I think I met somebody who has uh dog collars like a like a Fitbit for dogs right five EFI right and so you could take that and probably sell that to Pet Insurance Underwriters right so it's like it's not your core business it's this residue that comes off of your business that I think you could do interesting things with um it's another example like procurement management system so kind of this like esoteric enterprisey thing but if you have all this spend going through this procurement management system at your company could you go and sell that to hedge funds on like hey this company's you know uh average contract values going down or it's getting a lot more seats sold this year right and so can you take again not your core business and I don't think companies are really good at monetizing this on their own so it's basically building this platform that goes to these companies and builds these data Products off of their sawdust that makes sense with the the business that Sean and I are and we're in newsletter business like people have all these questions but it's kind of broken down into just a cute few things which is just like figure out what content you can give people that they want to read every single day and then figure out how to acquire users for profit profitably and that's basically that's 80 of the business what's like the 80 20 thing for these like data businesses is there is there or or rather the 80 20 for making messy data clean data and make it a product that people like the messy dated a clean data thing that's just like you have to have a pain tolerance that's all that is right and so I think this is why this is actually I think why CBI has done well is like we've had a bunch of Valley companies come in and they want to Splash machine learning on it and like you just have to get into an Excel spreadsheet and clean the data like that's just it and if you're not willing to do that nasty work you're kind of dead I'd say the businesses that work are I think like my framework is variable SKU highly opaque High consideration and so I'll break that down so high consideration means like somebody's taking risks or putting a lot of money out there right it's just like it's got there's some skin in the game opaque meaning it's just hard to find you know and I think if you go into slack groups and people are like hey does anybody know X that's usually an asset class that's like opaque right does anybody know who a good vendor is for this or a good software provider is for this and then the last one is variable SKU which is like like a car is a high consideration software purchase but it's not really variable like it's got a set of features you can compare them on a grid and so the internet's really good for that I like businesses where like the variability of the SKU is significant because you can't just put it into a table you can't like an iPhone's an iPhone is an iPhone but like we are we launch yardstick like you know I don't know a radiology software that uses you know that AI reads Radiology images like those are totally different and so right that's like the framework I use and so when it meets on those three I think that's an interesting messy hard business that's going to be a lot of pain but like you could build a moat around that all right Sean you want to do it oh sorry you had one of your columns so so I told you you have 77 rows so those are the different ideas but then you had some columns one of them was frame Frameworks or or inflections and that was your that was one of your your things opaque variable SKU High consideration the other one you had was Tiny But growing meshes like or like inflection like it might be time uh for that to grow is that is that your other one that you look for in ideas and we can give an example here of like uh here let me grab one like you did this representation media so you said extend the Rebel Rebel girls book for other communities and then your framework was tiny bit growing niches so talk about that idea and explain it with that framework yeah so Rebel girls if you're a parent of a daughter you might be familiar with it so we bought this book when my daughter was you know three four and it's just like one or two page stories of like famous women in history so like Amelia Earhart Marie Curie Maya Angelou and it's great like it's a it's a really kind of inspiring book really cool artwork that book is sold I think 5.5 million copies at like 20 so it's like 110 million dollars and that's probably dated right but I think there's like this idea of like what I what I call representation media right I bet you could extend that to uh I don't know like Hispanic entrepreneurs or like autistic scientists right like people want to read about and see examples of success in their communities and so I think you could extend Rebel girls across a bunch of different things and so that's the I think that Niche is growing right like people like you get these micro communities that actually are pretty large that would love to read about themselves and receive good representations of themselves that's a great idea uh I've had the I've had a similar idea because uh we get gifted some books that are like uh I don't know like Hindu religion book or like but it was like the kids version or something like that it's like the like and it's like oh yeah if I'm gonna read whatever you know Clifford the Big Red Dog you know like is there is there something that you know adds a little bit of something from our culture or religion like makes it easy for me as a parent to like give them you know something I want to give them while still being entertaining and accessible and there's actually just not much that's out there for that so so I definitely uh think if you added up all those little all those little different issues that's that could be quite big yeah I mean I think if you kind of on PC if you found a story where the protagonist was like a little white kid like make it a little brown kid make a little black you know like modify the story a bit and like that's a winner right because like kids love seeing like oh that kid looks like me that's dope right and so like you're Off to the Races there I don't think it's that nothing's hard it just takes some work but yeah dude that's why my that's why my wife loves Kim Kardashian she like sees him she's like oh hey look they got fat asses too [Laughter] dude fat a good way by the way back in a good way when I met uh the comedian Hassan uh minhaji we he was like doing his live shows and I told him I was like you ask me something like oh what would you do with if with my business if you were me and I was like dude I would stop this like live touring thing that comedians do like this is so painful you're on the road like I don't know 40 weeks out of 52 in a year I wouldn't want to do that I was like you got to create a Broadway show I was like create like the next Hamilton and then that goes on tour right touring is a great business but you just don't want to be the guy sitting on the stage I was like use your creative and comedic genius to do that it was my kind of big idea for him he's all right what's the show and I was like ah dude I don't know now now I'm out of my all right and then the next like a week later I just sent him a voice note and I go Aladdin but but Aladdin's black and he's like what and that was my whole voice note and then he goes um what are you talking about I go remember the Broadway show thing I go it's Aladdin but they don't it's not like Jasmine can't marry Aladdin because he's like a poor guy no no Jasmine can't marry him because he's black because like you know her family doesn't approve and he's like okay so it's just he's black instead of poor and I was like hey look when you say it that way it doesn't sound that good but like I'm telling you there's something to this idea of he overcomes they fall in love and the love wins and he's like all right yeah yeah I'll add that one to the list yeah that's what he said he's like stick to podcasting Sean oh yeah representation media all right can I ask you about one this is actually really fascinating and actually I think can be a bigger business than than I don't know if you think but bigger business a lot of people think a daily executive briefing email yeah I don't I'm not sure how big this one could be I think I I don't know if I put in the sheet I said you have like a dollar column which is kind of like my indication of how big it is I think this is like a great side hustle business right so I when I worked at American Express every morning our CEO would get like a briefing from his chief of staff right like you know here's what Capital One did here's what city did yesterday here's what visa did whatever and it was like basically that person's job to like scour the internet and like look at financials and product launches and all this stuff and there was a company that cision bought called bulletin intelligence which I don't think I don't know how much they're doing with it but it was basically that idea it was going to be like your morning Chief of Staff email and yeah I think this is an awesome business that like somebody smart and industrious can can build and you I think if you go Niche meaning like GO Financial Services because like if you get AMEX like the CEO of Citigroup like cares about Citibank cares about mostly the same company so you can reuse a lot of it and it's not just the CEO it's all like their division presidents and they're like geography like you know heads and all that stuff so yeah I think this is like and you know I'm sure with generative Ai and stuff you could like make this really like efficient but yeah I think this is like uh tens of millions of dollars business no I think you're way off so um have you heard of you guys know Politico right yeah it's like a Politico it's like a News website for DC all politics but it's not from uh like a CNN Fox News News perspective it's more so like people who work in politics they read Politico whatever that's not interesting what's interesting is that they sold recently to Axel Springer for over a billion dollars and where they got roughly nine figures so 100 million plus of recurring Revenue would they have this they have this service called Politico Pro have you guys heard of not have you heard of Politico Pro no I mean I know that's a premium offer I don't know what's in it so basically I think it's like a thousand a month I forget the pricing so someone's gonna like get on me but they had this they had their pricing but the me it's basically it's for if you're a lawyer um or if you work in DC and you have to know what type of laws are happening at like a real rate like who you know like hey the Senate is thinking about changing this like because we heard the senator say this in the news yada yada well anyway they have these things called Pro briefings and they send at least one a day but sometimes more than one a day and it's really fast short emails and that's your briefing of what's Happening that day with uh with like a very very very Niche thing so for example uh they have a segment just for pharmaceutical uh companies so if you're a pharmaceutical and you want to know right away what's happening with the new laws uh or if you want to dive deeper and read about researchers or if you just want to have a conversation with an analyst you spend thousands of dollars a year tens of thousands of tens of thousands of year and that's basically what you're getting is this briefing as well as a few other things they scaled this business to north of 100 million in recurring revenue and it's pretty fascinating and there's a few others doing that and so I think if you could actually pick the right thing whether that's Pharma legal I don't know what else there would be um uh all different types of Finance I think you could actually build a really interesting Daily Briefing business and you could even have a user say which companies they want to spy on a little bit more than normal and I think you could charge tens of thousands of dollars a year for a subscription like that yeah you can charge a lot for this like these folks like as long as you deliver quality in the morning when they need it like yeah there's they have sort of massive budgets and I think bulletin had Bezos as a customer for a while so like he was reading the bulletin intelligence briefing every morning so what's that company called bulletin bulletin intelligence decision bottom many years ago Dude the reason why I like I like talking to you is like you and I are some of the few people that nerd out on there's like all these data businesses out there so you and I for years have talked about there's like uh informa which is like a 10 billion dollar market cap basically data and trade show business then there's Euro money which we've talked about another publicly traded company there's a decision which like is just kind of an older company that no it just these companies are just huge and they're just not sexy so they're not talked about with our Circle but they're crazy fascinating to like learn about these companies because their margins huge yeah it's a I mean it's a build once so multiple times kind of business right so like once you build that data asset or that info asset like you can keep selling it so yeah they're great businesses they're unsexy which is always good because like then you don't get all the smart people kind of trying to come in and you know eat your take your lunch money so yeah I like these businesses a lot you had one on here also that was the pricing data so it was like go extract the pricing data from every SAS tool and you know go to their go to their website find the prices organize all that information for things where it requires a demo quote like I don't know send a you know five dollar an hour employee through that process collect the pricing data now you have it now you can make that visible where they are hiding it on their website and you basically have a giant what like a search engine or a database of of okay if I want to use some email you know send software here's the here's how the prices compare across them is that what the idea would be for that yeah I think the idea there is I think you should start with public SAS pages and you figure out how to crawl them or you just you know M turkm or something uh and then yeah email service provider what's the pricing what are the features I think the real killer there which is you know maybe borderline is like you actually because a lot of Enterprise companies don't put their pricing on their page so you hire somebody who goes and pretends that they're a customer and gets the pricing and then that's really really valuable right because like now if I'm because pricing's like a dark art in B2B you're like yeah sounds good right and like everybody's got opinions and nobody has data so I think you could actually do something really interesting there like long term if you actually called companies and got that pricing or talk to their customers and you get their pricing but that's actually the tagline it was the tagline on your website which is uh without data you're just another idiot with an opinion or something like that I think dude that's great it was great right I don't know do you guys use that are you we don't use that anymore I think we we still use like in God we trust all others gotta bring data like so we'll use that in some who uh who comes up with this stuff this is you or this is someone on your team who's like the witty copywriter these are just stolen from other people who are it's like a quote the idiot wants a quote I think right I think both of these are like you know somebody like some luminary and you know we we footnote them in small print and give them credit uh do do you think that you guys being kind of silly is a leg up or do people criticize you yeah I mean we get some criticism but honestly like B2B is so mind-numbingly boring that like it's it's great as a way to stand out but you know I I tell the team like you know love us or hate us you should have an opinion on us and so that's the general theme right because most of it's like pretty vanilla and you know just kind of like jargony and so yeah it's been it's been I'd say a net positive for us but we've lost some customers over stuff we've said that offended them and what like what you know we did a ranking one of VCS once and we said a specific firm was losing in the ranking and it was just an objective thing and they were like we're canceling our subscription immediately right and uh um what a loser move of them it just proves my point oh you don't you don't want access to data now you got you got your feelings hurt and you canceled your own your own data pipeline you're like you're down another Peg uh so we've had you know that and some people don't like you know I think when Trump hysteria was going we like sometimes put an infographic with him in it and like we didn't have an opinion but it was just like you just him and Elon Musk like if you mention them it's this like lunatics come out right and so like uh and so it's good for engagement but it is definitely like a little bit it can be odd like you say something and people just like they've you know it's it's a cult and people go kind of crazy like I you you all you're a really good writer and or whoever's writing is really good and you guys always use things like um your headlines are really good but then there's like just phrases all over like it's built into your culture like in your annual review we're like hey we did pretty good for a company that isn't lighting money on fire like the rest of the VC world they're like just like little phrases like that it just makes it stand out and I think that that makes you have a voice and you guys are actually pretty good at that yeah and I appreciate that I mean I think it's you know it's partly for the external Market it's partly for the team right like you're selling B2B software and so sometimes that can be like you know if you're 22 out of school it's like hey that's not super inspiring and I don't know exactly what that looks like and then once we can show them we can have personality we're in the tech economy which is interesting so yeah it works you know we screw up a bunch of things but that's been good for us if I was going to go out there and do what you said of getting all the data and like hiring people to call and actually get uh quotes who would I sell that to on the software pricing yeah I think you go to product teams at software companies and say like you know or your CR Chief Revenue officers and say like hey like you know do you know how you came up with your pricing like you know and here's what your peers are pricing at and give them like a snippet and give them a taste and be like hey we have all this other detail behind right how much would you charge uh I mean I don't think you start anything with like crosstalk big companies and like you start at you know twenty to fifty thousand dollars right like it's easier to go low than to start low and go high we just um you just handed someone listening a pretty solid idea right I I think that I I think the thing people do is they under price we did this in the beginning our first CB insights when it started was 395 a month and what you actually got was a bunch of people who didn't know how to use data who were a pain in the ass right and so it was like your worst nightmare it was people who churned quickly who paid you little and who were blowing you up on chat all the time for support and then I remember meeting a management consulting firm and they were like hey can you add a couple zeros to the price because like one your price will look like a joke internally and two I don't want to wait behind the guy paying 395 a month for service so like it price is a indicator of quality is an indicator of other things Beyond just like the core value of the product so that was like eye-opening to me like I was always like oh you know price low and you know do all that and like you know now we're we're orders of magnitude higher than we used when we started that's awesome Sean what do you got uh let's do some non-data nerd ideas so um I'm gonna pick it do the college rankings one yeah yeah let's do the college rankings one day would you call it broke and busted broken busted college rankings okay so what uh what's the what's the inside here so I think U.S news and World Report is sort of like the preeminent college rankings there's been plenty of coverage about how that's a basic con right and like universities do all this sort of finagling to try to get higher in that you know I look how's that work yeah they pay or what what is what's that I don't think it's that they paid I think it's that like you know you've got these like subjective criteria like uh you know student to teacher ratio right and so like universities will like massage that data so it looks good right and so like you know that it's like a limited set of factors um and it's unclear how causal those factors are to actually getting a good education right and so I think you turn that on its head well I think U.S news and World Report you know I think in like 2013 it was doing like 40 million in revenue and now it has like again LinkedIn 500 some odd employees so I I gotta believe it's doing 100 million plus in revenue and I'm assuming college rankings is the number one thing so I think the thing you do here is you actually go to graduates of the school and just ask them for their W-2s and you're like how much are you making right you just took on a bunch of debt like does this place actually get you a job that gets you paid or are you like you know a server in a restaurant and you got like your 200 000 in debt and so I think you reach out to alumni go get their W-2s and basically put a ranking together of here's how much I paid and here's how much I make when I get out and if I'm a parent I'll care about that I'll be like I don't really want to send my kid to a school where their prospects for employment are garbage um and so I think it's like takes all of the it's a very singular characteristic so it doesn't take into consideration social life and all that other stuff but it's like I think it's pretty important right especially you got all these people like leaving school with you know tons of debt so that's the way I would do it and you have to probably pay those students or ex-students a little bit but I think it's pretty cheap and you probably go like do like New York colleges to start like start Niche like don't try to be everywhere right out of the gate like you know and then build out from like concentric circles from there do you wanna like I don't know about you shot but like what is we're talking about some nerdy stuff here but I I find it like crazy fascinating because it's very clear to see the opportunity here but what's shocking is like when you say oh I'm gonna go get the data someone like me I would be like um well I gotta go like Google it and like find a database and you're like no I'll just like hire like I'll use Mechanical Turk you said earlier or I'll just hire someone or I'll just like make a ton of phone calls and just doing that stuff I can get interesting insights is and is that really how A lot of this works and and the beauty of that business is 99 P 99 people out of 100 won't do that work so like once you built the data asset like most people will think it's cool and they just won't do it like the other one that I like which is I don't know if I put on the pages you know I was uh trying to get a pool bill at my mom's house and like pool pricing is just like it's opaque highly variable and high consideration and like I have no idea what to pay for a pool like some kid should just go door to door at every person's house that has a pool and just be like how much did you pay for your pool and like get the specs and then go find out and then find out what do they pay per month for cleaning and whatever I don't know what a pool requires and like literally build the database of like that's a great idea who's in North Jersey here's what it costs so like yeah because that's what people Google too right like uh you know pool pool cost and then my city right that's a that's a a term that people will look for or even if they're just looking at pool costs but you have their their city in the headline they're gonna click that one over the next one and then you go back to the pool people and you're like Hey listen I got this pricing next time you want a bid you probably need to know what your competitors are bidding so like you can sell the data to both sides right like but it's definitely like it's a perfect side hustle like you know it would be like a thing that I you know I hope my kids will like just go do this like door to door and go get data I love how even though I tried to pick a non-nerdy data one it actually underneath the hood was a nerdy data one you're like the you're a data hammer and the whole world is just little nails that you're just trying to hammer with your you know like but dude this is the best business in the data like a vacuum you're the data Dyson that's just taking in this data from everywhere you can yeah I mean I love that business and I actually think like not to get off on a digression but I think this whole GPT thing is actually going to make private data like that much more valuable because like you know before it was like oh I'll give you my data and you'll just link to me and I'll get Google but like like that's all going away I think and so like having access to private data is going to be really valuable so yeah I'm I'm extra bullied and do you look at like for example the um the pool one is a good one because it's probably not the pricing's not probably changing all the time whereas maybe the college one you got to redo the the data collection every year in order for it to be accurate like for example in the content game or the media game which me and Sam think a lot more about is like if anybody can do really well with Evergreen content that's so much better that somebody's doing what we were doing daily daily emails where it's disposable and you got to recreate the product the next morning otherwise there is no product and so do you think about that when it comes to data like either the ease of collection or the longevity of the collection like really makes the idea more valuable versus less yeah I mean I think you probably want data maybe counterintuitively that requires a lot of refresh right because like that's what keeps people subscribing right if I can get the data once and it's good for three years it's like all right I'll get it I'll churn I'll come back to you in three years when it changes when it's actually a little bit more when there's a little more volatility to it it's like hey I need to know what's going on because like my business might suffer or what have you in the case of the pool when the pool owner is only going to buy it once right but you know that but that's okay right because like you could sell those leads to pool people you could sell that to pool cleaners like you could do all sorts of interesting things with it right and so like it doesn't have to be you're selling the data you could build advertising and Lead gen and other businesses off of it for sure okay I got one that there's no way this can be a data one a McCormick's spice competitor yeah I don't this one I don't have a lot it's just you know I think I have a column called zone of excellence and this one's out of my zone of Excellence uh look core mix is like this multi-billion dollar spice company if you open up your spice whatever cabinet like there's probably like these spices with like a red top right like that's all McCormick's right 24 billion dollar company wow in sales in sales public company yeah so it's just like like you know why isn't there like the I don't know the apple of black pepper like I don't really know how to do this [ __ ] right but like right like what's the what's like well I think for this one you're you're right you can go either higher end or you know just the more fun look at just branding packaging design and influencer most importantly so like who is the uh you know the whatever the Martha Stewart of YouTube that you can partner with that can be the face of a brand like this right like who who has that kind of brand and gravitas that can get into a Target or uh or the store shelves at supermarkets uh to compete with something like this and I think that's that's the way I would go if I was going to do this yeah 100 I think the thing that's interesting about this and I don't know anything about McCormick's is like the bundling like you know if you buy salt you need pepper if you need pepper you might be needing oregano and you might need whatever flakes that they sell out there right and so yeah you could just keep stamping this out across like every spice category but yeah this is not one this is outside of my zone of Excellence so I ain't doing this one but I like it they own everything I didn't realize this have you guys ever have you ever seen this protein bar at gas stations called Tiger's Milk yes they own this bar it's the worst looking like it's basically a label it looks like it was like drawn by Kenny Powers or like it looks like if Power Rangers ate a protein bar this is what they would eat and it's just like it's called Tiger milk and it has a it has a face of a tiger and it's like the protein bar they own that they own a bunch of different stuff this is awesome I yeah I have I totally should have um hell they owned Frank's Red Hot that's my favorite so yeah what a what a company I didn't I didn't realize that these guys were what they are that's wild man they're created in the 1800s yeah I mean yeah they're just you know brand recognition and everybody knows I mean if you go to the spice aisle it's all that like they just own the whole thing right so you got to come up with a distribution hack here but that's you know Sean that's probably more your world than mine but yeah for sure can I ask you a quick question different from my ideas but about money so I'm not gonna you can say it if you want I'm gonna assume that you own a a chunk that you are on paper worth mid to high low to low to high hundreds of millions of dollars have you taken any money out of your company or has your only income for the last I think you said 10 years you've been running this just been like a a normal mild salary yeah so I didn't I didn't pay myself for the first four years so when we raised money then I basically took my back salary and then since then I've not uh not taken any money off the table so yeah I'm I'm foolishly long or brilliantly long CB insights we'll see what we'll see how things play out but yeah I'm all in were you wealthy before you started the company like did you have Banker wealth so just no no no I just you know I got married right before I started the company I told my wife when we were dating that I don't want to work at a big company anymore and we're gonna like there's gonna there's gonna be some lean times and so she was down and so I just saved religiously like we didn't go on vacations with friends and just like you know and it was always like awkward because they're like oh do you want to go somewhere and I'm like oh I'm super busy but because I just was like no I don't have money so yeah I just saved like crazy I'm busy I'm busy being poor right now so I can't go sorry I'll check the calendar when I'm not for I'll start going I just saved a ton of money and then yeah for the first like two years of CBI just paid for a small team out of my pocket and then we started generating Revenue but wait why haven't you taken a few million bucks just off the table just to make your life a little bit better it wouldn't it would have no material output yes okay yeah and by the way just so we have numbers you basically have only made I imagine middle hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in salary is that right yeah I mean I'm I now get paid like a fair CEO salary right so I'm not like it's not like one of these big public company guys but like um yeah I think I just we've been really focused on the business and like I just think it's a giant opportunity and candidly part of the reason we didn't raise in the beginning was because I don't think I'm good at pitching and I also worked in Venture and I didn't like want to work for my investor right like that was always like a very guiding principle of mine like you know when I look at s1s of companies that go public and I'm like you know the founder owns like five percent I'm like that's just like that's a backwards calculation yeah probably you know should have could have taken money off over the course of time uh right now would not be a good time to do that given where the markets are so I figure we'll just keep growing out of this current sort of malaise that we're in and then you know opportunities sort of tend to present themselves even our fundraise was like a customer sent us a term sheet over email I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better tell the story of the of tell the story of the guy who offered you 100 million dollars via DM uh how did that go you know I get some interesting DMS on Twitter and so somebody offered 100 million you know I think this guy was broke as a joke but it was still funny I said uh you know not interested not looking to sell and I think then the email chain kind of devolved from there where he was like you know I'm gonna build a competitor and put you out of business and uh yeah it was good I don't recall I don't remember it was like some you blurted out of the thing I blurted out yeah so so he sends this DF you posted the DM screenshots it starts like hey here's who I am really interested uh you know in partnering or an acquisition uh let's talk please call me and then you're like thanks yeah not even thanks THX right just like the the short thanks um not for sale nice and he goes and then he goes how about a partnership and then he just keeps going and he's like here's how about this I'll give you 100 million dollars for the business you are now your fiduciary responsibilities is you have to present this to your board you know um you know that let's go and then you go you go okay interesting strategy uh best of luck and he goes so do you accept the offer and then he then he devolves into all right then I'm gonna create a competitor have you seen this competitor launch is he uh is he in your lunch yet or what surprise surprise we're yeah we're tracking religiously to see when this launches you should have him back be like hey how's it going man uh curious about the law of details yeah yeah now that was that was atypical I think most of my my DMs are are nice but yeah that one was a little a little out there what would you do with the money now if you sold um I mean I think the thing I do is I want to build a school of entrepreneuring like I think education is broken uh and so I think like kids should just learn how to build businesses and not go to college and so that's what I do and I think there's a bunch of colleges that are struggling that I could go buy like a plot and build like a dope campus for for a bunch of like high achieving kids and we'll just like go figure how much would that take I have no idea I have no idea this is like but you'll have it this is my distant dream but yeah I think like I just read a great book called the case against education uh that kind of breaks this down and it's really interesting and uh yeah I think it's like I think there's an interesting thing to be done there and uh and then yeah I'd love to like do some stuff in India along that lines but yeah this will be my last true startup I've I've looked into a bunch of uh I have like alerts set for colleges for sale because I had a similar dream and idea at one point in time I haven't I now don't want to do this but uh it's amazing you can buy full college campuses for sometimes single digit Millions sometimes just like 10 to 15 million dollars it's crazy like which ones it has to be less than the replacement cost of just the buildings and the land on the in in this these places so so I am not sure why and these are accredited universities that a lot of them are are they start as just like they do one like things like just cosmetology or just whatever there's like there's like those those are really cheap those are like you know 1.5 million you can have a you know University a college that does that all the way up to here's a campus in New York for this like small liberal arts college that's not doing so well and like you know for 15 million dollars you could take the whole thing and um I'm like is there like a Marketplace for that is there a Zillow for bankrupt universities uh there should be but there's uh this one website called deal stream that happens to have most of them that I see um so deal stream will send me emails of one like you know multi-campus beauty school here you go um you know that just got this email two days ago what made you sour on this idea Sean uh just like the lifestyle component I was like would I like would I want to actually if I was gonna do this it was like okay I'm gonna basically go be the dean of the school and I'm gonna like basically this will be my baby and I will make this great and I was like oh it's a lot easier to just like have a business I could just do on my phone and my laptop you know four hours a day and not worry about this and just hang out with my kids and and you know have fun and so I was like okay yeah there's an all-in version of Entrepreneurship that I'm no longer like super interested in because that would require um you know same thing like I'd rather do this podcast than go speak at events I think in the last three years I got invited to speak at maybe 150 events and I've said yes to two of them right like you know so it's like you could make good money and grow your audience doing this but nah seems like a lot of work you know I think I'll try to just win the way I want Sean have you ever um have you read the blog post that Anon made years ago about I think your father or someone in your family got sick and they couldn't run their Factory in India anymore and you had to go did you have to run the factory right now his dad yeah my father passed away in April 2017 and so he had a chemical business in India and uh yeah you know like he built it over many years and and like I was like all right I can't just let it go to zero so I ran it while I was running CBI for about 18 months the the title of the blog post is how to manage and sell a company in an industry and a company and a country you don't know and uh it's kind of great it's like a full like full-length sort of like here's the whole thing um do you want to tell like the short version of the story and then people can go read the blog yeah I mean so uh he died on April 17 2017 and as we're going to cremate him we're Hindu and uh this worker from the factory comes up to me in Hindi my hindi's pretty weak but I understand it and the worker was basically like in you know what's going to happen to us right and I was like you know I'm like a mess but I was like all right I guess like there is this thing and my mom and him basically built this business over 20 years you know kind of like a small Chemical Company like nothing what's that mean gargantuan uh in terms of size no or chemical what's a chemical oh it was like a it was um it was it's in a sector called Fine Chemicals it was a raw material that goes into perfumes and like uh flavors and fragrances right and so he built it one of three manufacturers in the world that could make this product it was a really finicky product um and like I'm like all right I guess I gotta run this and like my dad was like a mad scientist like off the chart smart and I'm like I'm not that right and so uh so I'm like okay what do I do here like because I don't if something goes wrong in the factory I can't help so the only thing I can do is probably try to bring in more business so I just went online and like cold called every large Chemical Company that's in this space and I was like hey we make this product if you ever need it like come you know come talk to us so we had like our best couple of quarters ever when I was running it and luck because you were doing outbound and he wasn't doing any or he just wasn't doing it well my dad was just like he was a sign he was like a product guy so he's like the best product will win right and like put this put picture up on the YouTube channel of the blog post where it's the side of the building it looks like and it just says on one side good quality and then there's a giant equal sign and then it's just good business and that's like it looks like as is that the side of the building as you approach to walk in it's like hey reminders I was entering the factory yeah good quality equals good business [Laughter] Times New Roman font oh my gosh this is awesome but yeah I was just like I can try to go sell because I can't help on the technical side the team he had assembled was awesome so they've kept the factory running you know got had good sales people kept reaching out to buy it you know a lot of them like you know when somebody once a proprietor dies like a lot of Bottom Feeders show up so I was just like trying to make sure that these weren't those people because I want to make sure the team landed on their feet and then yeah just navigated through it I met a banker was representing this buyer they were above board people and yeah after 18 months for a while because I'm like insanely ambitious I was like oh I'll have like CBI as the data form and I'll have like this industrial arm and we'll build that and then like you know it'd be a [ __ ] Tycoon yeah well I mean for it you know and then I was like telling my wife I was like yo we gotta have more kids because like if we want to build you gotta like you gotta have a lot of kids to like take this take all these uh These Arms of this industrial conglomerate up and she's like you're insane and then uh and then yeah like 10 weeks here or is six weeks here 10 days in India like I mean yeah like that was brutal so then I was just like all right I gotta sell this and then I was fortunate to sell it and the team is still all there and yeah everything worked out so what did you sell it for uh I can't disclose a good I mean like a good amount yeah it was it was you know I wasn't optimizing for the dollars I was optimizing for a clean deal to a person who would not fire everybody that my dad built the business with so you know so I'm sure I could have gone to somebody else who would have like torn it down and you know done other things with it but I felt really good about these guys so yeah I think it like it achieved non-financial objectives that I think were more important to my mom and to me than maybe the financial objectives this is a really really good blog post that you have and it kind of got lost over the years you guys got to share this again more yeah yeah I mean it was uh yeah it was you know the team at CBI I got to give him credit like I mean I was kind of an absentee CEO for a little bit and they like kept trains running on time so yeah it was it was a it was a good uh a good thing to accomplish I was glad glad you had some like takeaways on the m a process uh I'm curious I'll just read the headlines but you could decide which one of these you think you have a strong point of view on or strong message to deliver here so you said should I have hired an investment bank and you were like I didn't have one I represented myself maybe I should have uh you said don't let lawyers run the process so lawyers are often trying to mitigate risk but it's easy to just like have everybody get entrenched in like you know risk management and not actually have the deal go through uh don't sweat the small stuff uh quote the industry standard is a phrase to watch out for so give me your thoughts on one of these the industry standard one I think is like the one that like I hate because like people only use that when they can't justify the term they just say like oh no but that's just industry standards how we do things we always do things that way there's no such thing as industry standard right like if it's it's if it's good for you then it's what you should aim for and that you know it's some somewhat counter to the sweat the small stuff thing so you don't want to negotiate on every little thing but when I hear it's industry standard like my ears always perk up because it's like somebody's like trying to get one over on me on this right or they're just trying to like make it the sweetness under the rug so I think that's an important one uh you know sweat the small stuff I think like put some stuff in that you want to negotiate on that you don't care about that you're just willing to give on right but like you know just don't make the pain you know don't make the negotiations super painful in all regards on Bankers like I think for this deal it didn't make sense to use a banker and I have I mean with CBI I have a bunch of data on like what comps are and all that stuff so I had it was good enough and it wasn't a big enough deal that I wanted to like cut into somebody for you know five seven percent you know if CBI was doing a deal now like we'd absolutely have a banker because I I've definitely seen like the value of what a great Banker offers um but yeah I mean I think the the industry standard stuff is probably the thing like anytime you hear that I think an entrepreneur should like just wonder like okay why are they just pushing for industry standard in this particular area because it usually it's always industry standard to the benefit of the person across the table it's never industry standard and good for you uh and so that's one I would definitely push on can we um one thing happened over the weekend Sean that you and I had talked about and I actually think it's a good time to talk about it now because I have a feeling that anan's gonna know a little bit about it do you remember uh probably two months ago we talked about this guy named Gautam adani I think his name is you know what I'm talking about you were like I mean you're not to blame we were just using the news and you were like this guy's amazing look at what he's doing he kind of looks like an Indian Mario guy and he's like doing all this cool stuff where he's like doesn't really care about looking cool and he gives his money away yada yada yada and now he's like the third or first richest man in the world the news was I think he had gotten to second or third richest men in the world and I didn't think most people knew his name I says hey there's this guy adani here's what he does and I think we even said it I don't remember really saying this but a lot of people DM being like you guys called it because news came out that there's like some fraud going on or whatever with their company and I guess we had said something that was like you know either this is just amazing or you know you never know because of whatever I we have to go back and listen I'm not sure what the what the clip was but a lot of people like you guys called that which yeah people were saying that too and I'm like I said thanks but I don't actually remember I don't remember calling that I do remember when I was reading about it was a lot of people were like hey this is kind of a shell game like he's basically raising money he's raising money in one company using the like basic borrowing against another company that he owns and that company's borrowed against another company that he owns and he had like so many entities that were each sort of like um the justification for the next uh in terms of either the valuation or borrowing money or whatever it was I don't I mean this is a couple months ago I don't remember what the details were but I think we just said that as a footnote it's not like we were calling him out on anything I think people are giving us a little more credit than we deserved on that one so uh sorry to interrupt you Samson yeah that's the back that's a background so I think on Friday Hindenburg research I think they're a short seller so they they short companies but they produce scathing reports and they've done this a dozen times I I can't I'm sure a non-new products you probably know some of their examples but they're just like known for these really good reports well they'll write and say this company we think is total [ __ ] here's why and then it tanks and obviously they are financially incentivized to afford to tank but as far as I'm concerned I think some of the researchers actually kind of spot on sometimes and they have like a good track record but uh not have you filed this I followed it a little bit I mean I like Hindenburg because I think like there's like we live in like the age of drifters and so like you need people and I don't know if adani is but I think like you need people like Hindenburg who like you know or coffee Zilla or like Wendover Productions or any of these folks that are out there even on YouTube who are trying to hold at least shine a light on some of the griftiness that's out there and so I you know I like what they do in at a high level I don't know if they're cased with the Donny's like a good one or a bad one but yeah yeah well basically they they said like the entire company like there's a bunch of weird things going on with it um of all the like he they list all these companies and each person that runs one of the companies is one of his like relatives or former executive so it's all like kind of like uh uh uh it's kind of like his cronies are kind of like running everything and yeah he's like loaning money from other companies that he owns and he's making the valuations of each of those companies really high and so it turns out it's basically like a little ftx-esque where uh of just like similar or entities that he owns loaning money to other entities with the collateral being a company that he values himself among other things and so anyway I thought you guys would have like an interesting take on this because I don't know you had spent a little time in India you're in the finance world so I wasn't sure if you if you had an opinion there yeah no I don't have an opinion on them I I will say like when you see like org structures that are really convoluted like you know FTX sir adani or Enron before that like people always like in the moment are just like oh these guys are geniuses they figured out how to move stuff and do X Y and Z and then when you look back it's always like no it was just like a giant shell game you know Sean said like that that's an interesting lens I think to look at companies through and it's like the Innovation isn't the product The Innovation is like cap structure or some weird thing it's like okay that's a weird that's a kind of a weird business to build right where like that's what you're innovating on it's like companies that innovate in HR right like I'm always like you know they're doing all these weird things it's like don't you have to build a product like why are you doing like 3.5 days of work and like you know all this weird [ __ ] it's just like why don't you just work and like build a product so have you been able to capture uh or like catch any scams just or like make any right predictions based off the data that you guys have yeah I mean we don't we don't publish that stuff we usually send it to Media right because we're not like a media outlet but we'll find stuff where we're like you know this company raised that I'm not going to name but there was a company recently that raised like at a four billion dollar valuation and when you looked at like the founders and you looked at like the number of employees and everything it was like something's off here right and so you know and so like we would send it to somebody and say like hey like this looks odd like you should go do what journalists do and dig into it so we'll find stuff that's a little odd at times and then you know I think the more interesting thing sometimes is like you'll dig into filings of companies after they've been acquired by a public company and you see it's not this isn't like a a scam or anything but you see like you know hot company that says they got Acquired and then you actually see how much the public company paid for them and it's like you know 1 8 of what they raised right and so like you just sort of get it shines a light on like what was a real success versus what isn't I think that's probably what we tend to see more you know people who are want to do fraud or like if they're good they're hard to catch period right like it's just not something that is not where we spend our time also some of these things like the same exact signal that later you look at and you say oh man we should have known something was off like you said at the beginning it's a sign of of the genius of the of what's going on like uh I know with FTX um there was a bunch of things that now people are like wow this is you know those should have been red flags but at the same time those were the things that in stories they were saying were like kind of the the remarkable things about uh about them like you know um for example the you know like oh the the you know they all sleep in the same house and on bean bags and whatever and now it's like oh they had this weird like inappropriate you know like sort of like group dating thing going on but it's like uh before that it was like these are just 20 something year olds that you know are all like you know living in this Hacker House that are making it happen it's like no if on one hand it's one thing and then then like you know after it's exposed it becomes labeled as another and I've seen this with I've seen this many times where it's like oh you know same thing Sam bankman freed is this uh sort of like this this you know this quirky genius and then he turns out to be this sort of like uh you know this drugged up liar it's like the same thing he was doing before where he's you know taking whatever you know Adderall or whatever the hell he's taking in order to uh you know stamp and trade it was like yeah these guys are fueled by you know you know Red Bull and whatever and they're just working you know they're Geniuses that are outsmarting everybody in the market to like their game gamblers who were Reckless and uh you know were not making good decisions because of you know their lifestyle and what they were choosing to do and I've seen this this happen before I remember with Tesla um there was a point in time where I think Tesla had had like 10 or 15 different CFOs and my friend had told me this because I was like you know I'm reading a lot of stuff online about how like there might just be like some you know there's a lot of smoke I don't know if there's a fire but there's a lot of smoke about Tesla not being in Good Financial shape what do you guys think what do you think about this am I am I overreacting to these like conspiracy theorists on Reddit and Twitter and he's like well he's like I noticed something interesting he goes I always have this phrase follow the CFOs like the CFOs know the health of the business and what you never want to see was what was happening with Tesla which was like a rotating door of CFOs that would come in for three to six months and then leave and secondly um like the new CFO it's like the shy 24 year old or 26 year old that's you know now Tesla CFO wow he's amazing the same thing happened at FDX I remember when we we did we were uh they were sponsoring us for something and the guy who was paying us um was their head of strategy and we you know I didn't go on the call but I asked by later I was like so was he like you know super sharp or what was that guy's story he goes yeah he's 24. he's 23 years old or 24 years old and he started as whatever and now he's promoted he's like the he's the head of strategy for all of FTX and again it was like wow that's crazy I guess they're just a real meritocracy around there and they just you know land of equal opportunity and this guy just proved his Worth or it's like no this is his college buddy he's not going to ask too many questions and he can just trust him to to do whatever and say whatever right like these things from the outside I remember reading articles about this Wonder kid and uh and then later it's like a bad thing and you were right about the CFO thing with Tesla at that time weren't they on the brink well people don't talk about that much now but it did seem like they were on the brink or you know just you know narrowly survived either either properly or improperly I'm not sure but like later I remember one one uh interview Elon finally admitted it he he was like we were six weeks away from like you know the show being over for Tesla when they were having the model 3 production ramp and uh and he had said something in a separate interview that alarmed me as well which was about um there was like some what's that famous like green clean energy thing that Obama funded like like the green New Deal or something no it was like 600 million dollars to soy Vera soy lent sorry whatever I don't know some soyligen I don't know what it was some company that uh got a bunch of money and it failed and like up until the day they declared bankruptcy it was like we're we're good I don't know what you guys are talking about and solyndra that's exactly right and they asked Elon about that like you know just clean energy get a bad rap because of the you know the problems of solendra and others people say it's hard to make new tech work and all this stuff and he said something in a in a separate interview where he was like what are they supposed to say as soon as they if they ever admitted any weakness the stock would tank and it would guarantee their demise like they have to say it's all good you guys are nuts whether they are or aren't because the other one is is it it it will tank their stock and they will die for sure it'll accelerate their death so then I was like well you can't believe anything this guy says about how Tesla's doing if that's his mentality when they're you know I'm reading these things about how they might be on the brink he's saying they're all fine but he even says that that's the CEO's job in this situation so now you know what to do and that's a long story short about why I sold my Tesla stock too early yeah I do think like there's the signal that I look for it's not in the data is like the narrative when it's like a crazy founder narrative like uh like they were in Southeast Asia living in a monastery and they talk about like their clothing choices like that's always a weird one right when it's like we're not gonna talk about the business we're going to talk about celebrity wear some like moleskin t-shirt made from like you know but it worked with Zuck yeah but he wasn't like he built the product to start he wasn't known for his like weird I think it's the key thing when you can't see the product or the or the financials right like like for a lot of these things where it's like is the product legit and is are the financials like visible right but but even then you can't like you know FTX was a like a real product that that people used and the financials made sense at the time that like they were obviously gonna they're making money on every trade right people doing a lot of crypto trading how can they not make money um you know it seemed like it would work in both cases another example in the FDX side they had 25 engineers and I remember reading stories about how he was just like yeah we create like we're not like these Silicon Valley companies with all this bloat coinbase has like you know thousands of employees we have a whole engineering team of 25 and we do more volume than them because we hired 10x engineers and we we go for extreme operational leverage and later it was like of course these guys had like terrible security practices and all the stuff like they didn't even have they refused to even invest in engineering right it's like the same story the two sides of the same story once you once you know the result yeah 100 I do think there's signals when I don't think fraud but there's signals right now that companies are not doing well right so like you'll see companies raise it a billion dollar valuation and when we dig in we see like the liquidation preference is 3x but that stuff doesn't get reported right or you see the cro or the CMO leaves every six months kind of Sean's point on the CFO like that indicates there's problems it's not fraud it's just like hey this company's not killing it the way Outsiders might look at it I think Fraud's a tough one I think under performance and and companies that are not doing well that's a lot easier for us to figure out what's a company that's impressed you that we most people don't talk about because you guys see a bunch of companies that are that are interesting what's a company that's uh kind of flies out of the radar but kind of secretly crushes it and like a debt and it's gonna be it's probably gonna end up in the data World um so let me think it's all right um I don't know if anybody I will say like the area that I like right now and I don't think these are great businesses but I think like I think are interesting is like the the the folks that are uh analyzing the grifters right like I really like love this space because I think there's something to be built here like there are more media companies than they are great big tech companies um but there was like there's a couple that like are digging into like pastors and like the whole like Evangelical Pastor world and like it's phenomenal like the stuff that they do so like that's probably the area I go down a lot more in and then like looking at the businesses of folks like Andrew Schultz and folks like that like you know because I think there's a lot to learn from how they do marketing and how they build audience so I tend to look at businesses that I think we can learn from versus like just like random sort of businesses that are out there uh what what can a boring company like yours learn from Andrew Schultz so the thing that so I think the thing that he's done really well I I was purposely insulting you in order to uh make make the average listener be like oh yeah I'm not that cool the thing that he does really well is he doesn't just interview other comedians right I think he like he interviews other people who are kind of adjacent to him right and so what he does then is he keeps expanding his audience and I think most other folks like you know like I like Theo Vaughn and Theo Von's like interviewing other comedians right right but like he interviewed Neil deGrasse Tyson and I bet you that brought him a whole bunch of new people right and so I think that it was very funny yeah it was awesome and so this sort of like Schultz strategy of like adjacent folks I think is really smart to bring in like the Venn diagram is not as heavily overlapped and I think like he keeps building that way which I think is really interesting and so for us like it's always like who has an audience that's not exactly our audience but that has maybe a slight overlap and but would those people kind of like us if they knew about us right and so it's kind of like thinking about Partnerships there whether it's newsletter Partnerships or whether it's you know research that we do whatever it might be so yeah I think like looking at what's happening in the consumer side of media is always interesting because that's where like the Innovation tends to happen it doesn't usually tend to happen in B2B well dude I appreciate you doing this you're fun to talk to Sean what do you think we only got through maybe half of the half of the short list ideas so uh if people like this we should do a part two and uh and do more do more of the ideas thanks for coming on man this is fun and uh appreciate you know that you've been you know come I feel like I've seen you tweet about the show you know for a while now so you know that's a really appreciate that that's one of the cool moments of this doing this for us is that people we respect if they like our stuff too that gives you a little extra juice a little extra wind in your sales to uh to go out and keep going because it's it's different than just oh the numbers are going up but numbers don't have that same kind of like pull as you know um somebody who you think is cool you know liking your stuff and by the way Adnan it's your fault it's kind of my fault it's most it's part your fault basically I get like lots of messages a day but like five of them a day it's usually a young man in his 20s and he'll just message me and he'll say let's [ __ ] that's all I get and the reason being one time I was either on my way home or in route to the airport and I was T I hate flying so I take a lot of Xanax and so that's the only time I'm ever inebriated and I was very high and I messaged you and I said I'm in your hood let's [ __ ] and you replied like I'm down like here's a restaurant meet me there something like that and I told that story and uh now because of that I get I get a bunch of men messaging me that um living the dream Sam you're living the dream someone's dream someone's stream not my dream but someone's dream yeah I'm living I'm living a person's dream so uh you're gonna play for that but I appreciate you coming on and uh this is fun we'll talk soon all right thanks guys

how big is the business now I you guys have raised what like 400 million dollars yeah we've raised 400 million uh we we last traced Capital at 3.6 billion dollar valuation um I think there's still you know a lot of potential for health monitoring I think if you fast forward 10 years I think um a large percentage of the world's population will be wearing a continuous health monitor and it'll hook into everything that you do as it relates to the Health Care system and doctors and um and so yeah I'm very bullish on on the opportunity in the space [Music] foreign do you uh do you know what you're getting into or what I've read the briefing and uh uh I'm a big fan of the podcast so ready for you all right so like the the Pod it's called my first million it's kind of known for uh Sean and I have both started a handful of companies and sold a few of them and people like the Pod because we brainstorm and we dive deep on different companies and we do like business breakdowns things like that so but we'll spend a little bit of time kind of getting to know you because you've done a lot of amazing things well I know I've wanted a huge amazing thing that you've done but I bet you there's a lot more amazing things that you've done but we'll hear a little bit more about your background and then I'll then we'll want to spend time like kind of diving deep on different opportunities in your industry but first like if you want to like say like kind of like your your 30 second Spiel of like who you are and the story of how you got there yeah absolutely uh so well Ahmed I grew up on uh North Shore of Long Island I as a kid I was kind of always into the sports and exercise I ended up going to uh Harvard and playing squash in school and I was a competitive College athlete and I felt like I didn't really know what I was doing to my body while I was training as an athlete so that got me very interested in physiology did a ton of physiology research as a student I read something like 500 medical papers and I started to conceive of this idea of how you could continuously measure the human body and the idea was initially around athletic performance but broadly I felt like there would be ways to continuously measure the human body for all sorts of Health implications and uh you know what became as a sort of a curiosity ultimately turned into a very long research paper that I wrote and then ultimately founding a company uh this was would have been when I was 21 22 years old as a senior at Harvard and and then for the last 10 plus years or so I've been uh I've been building this this business uh the business whoop builds wearable technology uh really to improve People's Health we started with the best athletes in the world and and over time have grown to work with a large consumer population and uh and it's a really exciting time to be building that that technology okay so yeah you're the CEO of and founder of whoop uh if people have seen it it's a whoop band you've uh you have to have seen it on people's wrists but you said something like we started with high-end athletes and I think I read something like this that is this right that LeBron and Michael Phelps are two of the first hundred customers or users of whoop is that is that real and how did how did that happen that is real and this would have been around 2014 2015 so you know we spent about two to three years really on the initial V1 of whoop and you know I wanted to start with the best athletes in the world and really for two reasons the first was that we were bringing sleep and Recovery technology to market for the first time and I felt like professional athletes who uh you know have to perform on a daily basis should really understand how they're recovering that was one of the insights to starting the business and uh and then second of all if we could get the world's best athletes to where uh whoop and organically like it then we could build a whole brand around uh performance that ultimately could could scale to to Consumers and and I grew up very inspired by um Brands like Nike and and the Jordan brand and and just how like a swash on something could make make the whole product feel completely different independent from anything else about the product uh just because of the the storytelling behind it or the brand behind it so I was interested in how health monitoring Could Have A Brand to it and uh and so that was really the thesis for targeting professional athletes and uh and so in the case of getting to LeBron and Phelps the I think the key Insight was finding people in their lives who had a big influence on them who a bunch of people didn't already know you know if you go to their agent or their manager or their wife like they get inundated with this stuff so you have to find someone in their in their life who other people don't know and it also turned out back then that the personal trainer was a somewhat under rated or unknown person in a uh a professional athlete's life and that also happened to be the right person to go to uh for technology like whoop so in the case of uh Lebron I got to know Mike mencius in the case of uh Phelps we got to know Keenan Robinson both of which were personal trainers to those athletes and got them on Loop and then they got their athletes on Loop and um yeah the rest is history how big is the business now I you guys have raised what like 400 million dollars yeah we've raised 400 million uh we we last race Capital at 3.6 billion dollar evaluation um I think there's still you know a lot of potential for health monitoring I think if you fast forward 10 years I think um a large percentage of the world's population will be wearing a continuous health monitor and it'll hook into everything that you do as it relates to the Health Care system and doctors and um and so yeah I'm very bullish on the opportunity in the space do you like uh being the CEO of a of a big company um or do you wish do you like still wish that you were in the early days of like getting in the nitty-gritty because I imagine you're like kind of just making decisions now and managing people as opposed to maybe getting your hands dirty on the product well I've still tried to stay close to the product because I think it's something I've had a uh a relevant perspective on even as a company has scaled and I've been able to see around corners in a few areas for the product I think that the role of being CEO as you guys know changes a lot with stage and scale right like uh 10 person versus a hundred person versus 500 person like at each of these inflections your your role is definitely changing um I think because whoop as a technology gets increasingly interesting with scale it's made my role increasingly interesting as well so what do I mean by that you know the overall data set uh that you have on on a larger population makes the data much more predictive and much more powerful the coaching as a result can get much more comprehensive I think for other Founders I've met who have been building a business for five years or even 10 years they get to a point where they're kind of like okay this can run itself or I'm going to bring in someone new or I've kind of reached the relative peak of the mountain and I don't feel that way I feel like there's still uh a bunch more levels to go I feel that uh the insights that the Technologies they were able to get the number of people that it can potentially use by all that feels like it's amplifying not shrinking and and so for those reasons yeah I'm very excited about about being CEO it's also look it's a daily challenge growing into it I feel like at every stage of the business I've had to learn how to uh how to be a CEO and it's not like this is the first just the first company I started it's my first full-time job so you know I'm I'm figuring a lot of this out as I go Sam always asked that question and I'm just waiting for the one person who's like I hate being CEO I hate my job I hate all these people that are in this office this is terrible there's certain things that change a lot right like you you're the percent of time in which you think of yourself as an individual contributor versus a manager has to shift very dramatically uh I think probably around the size of 50 people it has to shift like that like it was about 500 people but that's probably one of the most painful things that if a Founder doesn't fully appreciate or recognize they can screw the business up a lot like you have to recognize that you need to be shifting almost entirely towards manager and not being an individual contributor well you know what it is is we uh we we talk to a lot of interesting people here and the CEO of like a 500 person plus company usually looks like [ __ ] not always but usually like they look tired and there's Rings under their eyes and they're usually a little chubby and it takes a huge Swig of coffee oh no they look like crap but you're a uh you're like the CEO of a fitness brand you you were a highly competitive athlete and so you look great and so it's like you're you're you're kind of like skewing the the uh the average here but like I mean you're like pretty fit is are you like how are you balancing like being healthy and putting your but also putting your company first because I like when I was really in the thick of it I was like dude I don't have time to work out like screw it I'm just gonna eat this crap but uh you don't know this but one of your competitors was my neighbor and we used to work out together in my garage every day and then uh and then he got promoted to CEO he was like he was like a different exec got promoted the CIA go and then uh stopped having time to work out like he just kept coming by while I was that's what I'm saying and he was like God I gotta get back in here and we're like dude you're the boss you know you could just like rearrange your schedule right he's like I got crazy it's crazy right now oh it's crazy right now and for like nine months straight oh it was crazy right now and he just stopped working out I was like bro you run a health company like you gotta if you don't sleep or work out or make time for this stuff like you know what's going on here and uh I just thought that was so funny like the the fact that he was like you know no we have to make this successful in order to do that I'm gonna make these Health sacrifices as I go what super nice like him I mean dude Will's got like a chisel jaw you got a nice head of hair you're wearing a it looks like a like a vest you look all you look all spiffy and you look nice and [ __ ] uh what what are you what are you doing to exercise right now and how are you balancing that with work I think it look I think it's part of the the job for me that that I'm gonna be in in good shape and healthy and uh I spent a lot of time around people that are super into their health and fitness whether it's professional athletes or scientists or even thinking about product features that are designed to improve your health so as a business like just thinking about the the product and technology that we build every day that kind of orients me at least to be uh to be healthy and not to mention I'm using a product that uh is all about health Improvement so you know for a variety of reasons it feels like it'd be super off brand if I was uh if I was really out of shape or or what's your like sleep score when you sleep are your uh you know you give us your give us your stats and also what are some things that you know a lot of this audience who listens to this um I would say probably I would guess the majority don't regularly wear a continuous health monitor um but also the majority care about performing well Peak Performance and as an entrepreneur typically um who's listening to this so what are some things that they a that you you've learned that you know they maybe should be doing or you know some of the biggest levers that you've seen when it comes to you know kind of health and performance well I want to be clear that that uh I do believe building a successful company uh requires overcoming some level of stress that would break most people so I I do think you have to uh really push above and beyond what is comfortable I think the technical term is man up will yeah okay Mana I think there's a lot I think there's a lot of techniques that you can develop for yourself that um allow you to run it at a Breakneck pace for a long long time you know people always talk about this analogy of okay it's not a it's not a Sprint it's a marathon but if you actually look at like world-class marathoners they're running like four minute miles or 30 miles it's kind of a Sprint yeah so you know and how do you run a mile that path so I think for the entrepreneur or the you know the the business leader listening to this you want to figure out a way that you can be sprinting a marathon for a long time and and one of the ways I view that is taking care of myself and and uh being in good shape uh I think we can start with uh uh sleep which uh is is it I think a topic that's not talked about in the right framework most people when you talk to to them about their sleep they're like yeah I don't have enough time I'm working hard blah blah the thing to understand about sleep is it's all about the percentage of time that you spend in bed getting high quality sleep so if if you ask your your audience or you ask a friend who's never worn a health monitor and you say how much did you get last night he'll be like oh well I went to bed at 11 I woke up at six I got seven hours of sleep pretty good okay the reality has been seven hours in bed so of those seven hours you were in a period of a wake a period of light sleep a period of REM and a period of slow way to sleep awaken light are pretty much irrelevant you're not getting any physiological benefit from being in uh awake or light stage sleep REM and slow wave that's where all the magic happens so REM sleep is and your mind is repairing it's like real cognitive repair um it's when you have deep dreams so if you're someone who can't remember dreams or you don't seem to have dreams you're definitely not getting enough REM sleep any High performing exec entrepreneur you need REM sleep um slow wave sleep is when your body produces 95 of its human growth hormone so just think about that for a second 95 of your human growth hormone gets produced during this stage of sleep you're not getting stronger in the gym right or working out you're breaking muscles down you get stronger during slower sleep so the more you get to that the better okay and let's take the person who spent seven hours in bed that person could have gotten a total of 30 minutes of REM and slow wave sleep or they could have gotten a total of five and a half hours of REM and slowly sleep like that's a like a massive massive difference that's a huge Spectrum the person with 30 minutes I guarantee you has all kinds of problems in their lives the person with five and a half hours I guarantee you is very happy very high functioning and what's like um what's like really strong if an eight-hour block was you know I'm in bed for eight hours what would be like a good level of REM and slow wave sleep if you can get over 50 of the time you're spending in bed to be uh REM and slow wipe sleep like you're you're doing pretty well uh and so I I I'm in that camp and and I'm also still optimizing my life more to be uh a CEO or an entrepreneur than a human right if I was just fully focused on being a great human I would probably spend eight to nine hours in bed right and I wouldn't look at my phone before but and things like this right um but because I'm still optimizing for being an entrepreneur I uh you know I spend more like seven hours and better you know seven and a half maybe if if I get a little extra sleep but I've managed to make that time you know like the three to four hours sometimes even four and a half hours of REM and slow wave sleep so I'm getting the REM and slow wave sleep that like a a person who might be spending eight or nine hours in bed is getting because I figured some stuff out that makes me sleep better so that that's sort of one whole category right there which is sleep and anyone listening to this should try to figure that out for themselves because it's it'll just dramatically change the quality of of your life I'll give you another hack I wear these blue light blocking glass before bed and they've got a red like kind of a red tint to them and uh if you think about laptops uh iPhones whatever all of them are emitting this light that is telling your eyes and your brain to stay awake and uh if you're like me and you're using your phone or reading an email you know closely before bed uh because you know you're you're doing work or you're staying on top of things uh it's gonna affect the way you sleep but if you wear these glasses it's like a get out of jail free card and you can look at all that stuff right up until the moment you go to bed and it won't affect your sleep so uh so that's like one example of of how you can hack both sides of it have you um you said you've been around all these uh interesting athletes and you also have access now to like millions of pieces of data who are some of the biggest freaks in nature that you've been around is there like Judy in Iowa that's getting like nine and a half hours of slow wave sleep and she's your hero you got like a picture of her on your wall yeah or like uh like all these athletes that you've been around like is there anyone who you just like you've seen them in real life because they're like Mutombo incredible yeah well you're like we first started working with LeBron James this would have been uh 2015 2016. his sleep data I could probably point to the one that was LeBron's which is kind of amazing like uh and it makes a lot of sense that that he was so good at uh and has been so good at recovering in his career because he's taking care of that third of his life and and sleeping great I think it's maybe the most REM and slow wave sleep of anyone I I've talked to um named Alex Honnold do you guys know that name is from free solo yeah yeah the climber the climber right so this is a guy who who uh you know climbs mountains without a rope essentially and uh and does these insane Feats that are extremely dangerous so the interesting thing about uh REM sleep is researchers were able to find the more REM sleep you get the less heightened your amygdala response so your amygdala response is is fight or flight you know that's what signals to your body to to to be nervous or to to get animated so it makes a lot of sense that the guy who's capable of climbing uh you know rock climbing these environments that no one's done before without a rope uh has this insane ability to sleep because that's probably in part what makes him so calm uh as he's doing these activities so I thought dude I just I just Googled uh Alex's name and then REM sleep I think we just gave you the promo of the century man like this is this is the marketing this is like it should be it comes up the first thing that comes up is like a TED Talk not uh your company talking about how you sleep more you get more REM sleep then you're able to like take a little bit more risk and be calm I mean that's like a really that's like a really interesting um uh play here why not on those athletes do you think it's a sort of like intentional thing like you think that they you know like is LeBron or Alex are they doing something that's making their sleep that much better or do you think because they happen to be great sleepers that a lot that is what allowed them to become such great athletes and such great performers I mean there's certainly there's certainly genetic things that make people better or worse than sleeping but uh there's also so many things that you the individual can do to enhance your sleep uh sleeping at a very consistent time so going to bed and waking up at a very similar time we'll just um we'll just unusually Elevate the quality of of your sleep often sleeping in a very cold room a very dark room a very quiet room a room of high air quality athletes who are serious about this stuff will you know measure all of that and dial it in I still think athletes aren't sophisticated enough about sleep and Recovery given how important it is to their overall performance but those are a variety of things you can do we talked about blue light there's certain supplements that work better or worse for people magnesium melatonin interestingly hard harder harder sleep drugs like the ambience of the world uh they they knock you out so your sleep latency is short but the quality of the Sleep uh is never that high so again back to that percentage of time that you're in rem and slow wave it it is rarely you know maybe if you're someone who'd normally be at 30 you're going to be at 20 percent dude I've uh I was a a 400 meter Runner division one Fortnight runner in college so I used to be like fairly competitive and I knew a bunch of basketball players yeah and I knew a bunch of basketball players who ended up going to the NBA because I I was friends with them in college and uh dude it's shocking how bad myself included how bad most competitive athletes are when it comes to like a diet and Recovery like I didn't know anything I just like I would eat like Ranch and pizza every day and uh a couple of my friends who went and went went on to play in the NBA like we're just eat McDonald's like on a regular basis it's pretty amazing how like some people are still freaks even though they don't do any of that nonsense you know uh it's pretty wild and we've worked with a lot of athletes like who yeah they used to play video games from 11 P.M to 2 A.M you know you got a game the next day in front of a million people you know and it doesn't occur to them that that actually is going to affect their performance and then you look at the data and it's like okay you're you've got a red recovery even though you didn't even drink alcohol because you stayed up late staring at a screen whereas if you you know had gone to bed at the same time they started playing video games here's the difference in what your your performances Sean you gonna make fun of me or something no I don't know I was gonna ask actually uh this is a personal question naps where what's what's the word on naps because I am a prolific Napper in fact one of my life goals is to be able to take a guilt-free nap every single day and uh I know athletes are pretty big on naps as well but I don't know if you could get to those deeper stages in a quick you know in a one or one and a half hour nap uh what's the word on naps remember Winston Churchill of you to have a daily nap that would yeah that'd be pretty good yeah that's a that's a good way to put it yeah yeah like he's the coolest he's the coolest person I can think of who who really pioneered the daily nap as a as a hardcore uh uh yeah it's a hardcore nap I'll I'll I like that I think that sounds better because my nap marketing is pretty pretty soft right now I need to I need to up it I need to have a Churchill nap in fact I'm gonna brand it as I'm gonna brand it as a Church Hill nap dude I I do it every day as well yeah yeah yeah yeah about two o'clock for for about 30 or 40 minutes every single day and you get in bed or you just lie on a couch kind of thing no I only go Sean you go to bed I only go to bed for nighttime sleeping and then I I refuse to lay in the bed I go to a different bedroom I have a nap bedroom and I have a master bedroom really yeah interesting and you wear a sleep mask or anything you just close your eyes I wear a sleep mask but I get knocked out like I wake up two hours later and I'm like I'm a whole different human being I feel like wait and you could sleep at night after two hours I can't do two hours two hours is a real nap yeah Churchill is that really what you do you do two not every day but that's my goal my goal is to get that to be an everyday thing right now it's in every third day Sean it's like here's my life advice young man you gotta get a solid 16 every day life's cream cheese I'm not a big nap person personally I I almost rarely ever take naps but I think that they're certainly uh plenty of research that shows that for most people getting a nap versus not is gonna make them uh feel better and uh perform better I certainly think a lot of athletes uh take them in the afternoon or even some will take them almost right up to the time before tip-off or when they when they have their their uh event so and they because I think one of the reasons for them is they also need to Peak in their performance much later in the day than most people right so like an NBA game might start at 7 30 or 8 and they're playing until until 9 or 10 or whatever and so but whereas most people are winding down at that time but they so they kind of need to shift their their Peak Performance later in the day whereas most entrepreneurs are trying to be you know Tip Top at 9am or whatever yeah I think that's right the challenge with naps is that the percentage of time that you spend in in uh trying to sleep is often lower as a quality standpoint so that's why I was kind of interested in whether you guys get in bed or whether it's more casual because you might up the intensity of the setup of your nap to really maximize the the quality of the sleep to try things like sleep mask or try you know a couple little things and you might all of a sudden feel even better after your nap are you the only founder are you are you a solo founder well I I was fortunate in that I met two really talented uh Engineers when I was graduating from Harvard so uh one is uh John capilupo who for 10 years was our chief technology officer and the other is a really Nikola he's still with me and he's our uh Chief mechanical engineer uh and the combination of of uh the three of us uh really built really built the company now uh a lot of it was algorithms development you know computer science data science having the right um prototypes and yeah so it was it was uh it was very technical out of the gates well what um um but you're you're the the you consider them co-founders or just uh uh meaningful uh contributors consider them co-founders I mean I I came up with the the idea for the company uh uh you know years before I met them but but they've been an amazing I mean amazing piece of of the whoop story and critical what do you um so you're the CEO you're you're uh and founder of a multi-billion dollar startup what what do you do with uh I assume I don't know if you're liquid or not um or if you have a lot of your Equity so tied up what are you gonna do with all your money when you eventually do get liquid uh do you have like any big aspirations are you just like a boring guy who just like when I've taken secondary along the way any secondary yeah I have I have it's uh well look it doesn't it doesn't actually change your your motivation all that much in building the business that was something that I remember someone's saying to me uh at various points when I had the option to sell some shares and uh I think it's really just made the quality of my life higher and you should post your sleep before and after the secondary be like do I sleep easier at night now by the way 50 million in the bank yeah it turns out I do actually I do sleep a little easier at night taking secondary I remember when I was first getting going in my career and I heard about these secondaries and I was like that's [ __ ] I think it was rooted a little bit in Envy but I also was like you got to be all in and now that I've like done a little bit of stuff I realize having a safety net and this is like a very obvious thing to say so I sound like an idiot here but having a safety net particularly like a meaningful safety net of of liquid net worth I think 100 makes you better at building your company and I think taking secondaries it changes on a scale sometimes it's too much but taking secondary I think will make you a better company Builder do you agree with that I do especially if you're like a growth stage of company I don't I don't think I ever sold shares until whoop was worth at least a billion dollars um and they were for Rounds that were super over subscribed so I but I do think that's a fair I think that's a fair lens to look at it from I've read about people taking secondaries at the you know series a stage or something and I don't know everyone's I could look everyone's circumstances are different so you don't want to you don't want to judge but um I do think for a company that's at a later stage where you're trying to you're making this calculus is this a company that's going to be acquired in a short period of time or is this a company that we're trying to build to be a standalone business and I think if it's more the latter you want your your Founders or your key your you know your CEO you want you want folks like that to be uh not sort of looking at their bank account wondering when they're going to cash out on this thing you want them in a mode of and I can keep going for a while uh and you know really optimize the business so yeah I agree I agree with you what do you do with your money do you just do like boring uh Vanguard uh or like index funds or or or do you do something a little more risky and what do you like to spend spend your money on I wouldn't say I'm the biggest spender of money um but I I mean I've enjoyed investing in stuff investing in startups meeting Founders I've enjoyed uh backing stuff that my friends do uh or start I if you go out to dinner with your friends do they just bill comes do they just sort of look at you and wait now or uh oh yeah they got they got T-Rex arms suddenly that that wingspan shortened up big time couldn't even get to the pocket anymore no I mean look I think it's uh it's great of course to be able to be generous too and and uh take care of people or cover bills or whatever um I I think it just sort of creates a peace of mind for you and in an important way if you're gonna be uh trying to do something for the next 10 years what companies did you want to start uh before that because I'm looking at your background so you said you're from Long Island you live in in Boston and went to Harvard so that's amazing but you studied economics like you it didn't look like you had and then you worked at a bank right or you're just like an intern at a bank you were I know my wife's from Long Island it look you're going down that's a very typical path of just being some like Banker type in in the city uh but you kind of like took a left somewhere what uh what other companies were you thinking about starting I wasn't thinking about starting companies at all actually and and your observation's right I sort of I thought in the back of my mind I would go work in finance after I graduated because that's what a lot of people seem to do and uh and I had some background in finance because my dad had worked in finance but you know internships are a great thing to figure out what you don't want to do so I worked at a hedge fund after my profession here I worked at an investment Bank after my sophomore year and I worked at a private Equity Firm after my junior year and the question I asked myself at each of those places is you know did I want to be my boss's boss her boss's boss's boss or uh you know if I could be one day and uh and I just didn't I didn't feel that pull I didn't feel this like gravitational pull towards it and uh at the same time I was becoming sort of obsessed with this idea and I think I ultimately became an entrepreneur before I really knew what an entrepreneur was it wasn't like I was choosing between three or four different ideas it was just this one idea that I became obsessed with well in the last uh decade that you've been doing this you know any entrepreneur I think sees other opportunities you see things that are pain points for your business that you're like man somebody should make this easier or you'd meet a bunch of other entrepreneurs and you realize oh wow there's like a whole universe of potential businesses that that can be started and be successful um a lot of people listen this podcast to try to get ideas to think about oh what what's what's possible what's possible what could I be doing right now and um so do you have any uh business ideas that have come to you you know as you've been running whoop that you're not going to go do because you're running but like you know maybe somebody else could do it I have a lot of sort of funny tangent like business ideas that are uh sort of silly business ideas that you you know think of uh I'm in the shower or whatnot uh and so we can we can rough on some of those and then I have you know I have some that are more don't don't tell us which ones are the serious or the silly we probably will get them all mixed up ourselves anyway so take one off your list and let's let's hear it okay this is a very funny one so the the idea for the company is is carb pipes and it's uh it's vocalist lessons while you're commuting in the morning so you're in your car and you've got someone who's teaching you how to sing and you know you're you're uh carpet yeah you're in a safe space so you could you could you can belt it out exactly so those are the types those are the types of ideas I feel like that I think of a lot I'll give that one I'll give that one a b Sam uh F I think I I always wanted to sing look dude you you have so much listen you have so much data so I both are having car pipes no it's stupid you're you're you're a brilliant man and you just had one dumb idea I'm allowed to say that you both Sean and I have both invested in a continuous uh glucose monitor companies um I don't know I don't know if you ever I I think I had an opportunity to pass on your company will or somehow a deck made it my way and I and I was a fool and I didn't do it or maybe I just didn't have any money I think that's what it was I think I think I just didn't have any money I think I was just I just didn't have enough cash um I mean I want to know like which of these wearables do you think are gonna be awesome and which wearables in the future are going to be uh are gonna be a thing you know on the Pod what we've talked about I don't have a background like you so I'm just kind of riffing here but I've always thought it was ridiculous how you can have like a cancer or something bad inside of your body growing and uh you know I've had family members who have passed away and it was like you know had we just gotten this MRI or CAT scan like six months ago you would have been fine and I've always thought it's very strange that something can be in your body and it's just a matter of you just didn't get it measured uh otherwise you would have been you could have been fine I've always thought that to be quite strange and whoop actually told me one time when I had covid and I thought that was sick and I'm like well sick you should tell me if I have like cancer as well you know what I mean uh that's that's a that's something that's always fascinated me yeah and I would put I would put all that sort of in the category of like uh obvious Innovation that's coming um the combination of body scans blood work and continuous monitoring through a non-invasive wearable um will ultimately be able to predict a lot of things that that uh you know are disease States or or uh leading indicators uh for death and so I'm very optimistic about how profoundly uh the healthcare space the relationship with your doctor I mean all of that will change it's which so so obvious and then the other thing is and and artificial intelligence is a very popular expression these days but AI will be enormously valuable for uh analyzing a lot of uh a lot of these some more complicated scans uh to look for things inside your body that might be off which otherwise required you know an expensive Radiologists to look at or something which startups do you think that are at like the sub 100 or sub 50 employee count and maybe sub 300-ish million uh market cap or uh valued uh like below that do you see in the health health and wellness and anything related to that category that you think is going to have a similar trajectory as you guys and has a bunch of uh meat on the bone for for growth and upside you know it's funny because I I think I've spent so long thinking about health and wellness it's almost like the bar to invest in a health and wellness thing is is too high so I actually find that I don't invest in all that much related to health and wellness like I'm racking my brain right now I think of something that I'm involved in that's and that's directly Health and Wellness a related company that I think is quite quite powerful is called whisper which I am an investor in and it is uh they've essentially built technology that allows you uh that can transcribe uh your thoughts which is is pretty powerful technology if you think about it uh the ability to sort of think something and and it gets written out uh so I really like deep Tech stuff like that that feels feels like magic feels like the future and how that how does it do that you're wearing like a brain scanner device type thing and then you literally think something and it writes it how what happens I don't want to butcher this but the the short of it is it looks like you know an old Jawbone might have uh one of those Bluetooth uh sets and and that's you know that's what the Technologies form factor looks like you literally just think something and it writes it or you have to like sort of whisper it uh uh I believe it's using your brain waves what's the URL of this uh it's whisper.ai okay I just saw it it looks like a little uh it looks like a like a hearing aid yep oh that's cool how much money have they raised you know uh I wanna say something in like the 15 to 20 million range wow that's pretty fascinating this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better so here's a category of work that's a little more serious obviously you guys have seen uh everything that's come out in terms of deep fakes and this ability to create videos of people that are almost indistinguishable from uh from a real video right I think that there there's going to be like uh a talent agency of sorts that's for non-living people so you know imagine if you're uh if you're Tom Cruise towards the end of your career the same way Justin Bieber just sold like the rights to his songs maybe Tom Cruise sells the rights to Tom Cruise and you can keep making movies with Tom Cruise for the next 100 years or another version of that is you can have uh an actor like Tom Cruise who's completely artificial have you seen the Tom Cruise deep fake on tick tock totally it's incredible it's the same have you seen this thing yeah it's amazing you know who did that Sean we talked about it uh [ __ ] uh the South Park guys is that deep Voodoo or that's somebody else I thought it was deep I thought deep Voodoo did the time Tom Cruise what am I wrong Miles Fisher Miles Fisher oh yeah yeah yeah yeah and uh he's the one who doesn't I think it's him and this other guy because he kind of looks like Tom Cruise but there's a whole technology I think that doesn't even need a human involved which you know would just essentially take the fact that Tom Cruise has made 50 movies and be able to yeah but that's interesting you're like instead of selling your back catalog sell your future catalog basically so you can sell your likeness to your light you could create a AI likeness and just license it out to whoever wants to you kind of use it which is obviously has some you know some potential like you know ways it can be misused but seems valuable enough where people would figure that out have you guys heard of Michaela I think her name's uh is the name Michaela the Instagram influencer who doesn't exist you know what I'm talking about yeah yeah it's like a model that is completely made up right yeah yeah but now but now she's got like a boyfriend I don't actually know if they're together or not anymore but she's got like a whole cast of characters now and I've been getting into it and they raised a bunch of money and like she's getting ad deals it's super fascinating dude it's super fascinating and what's more fascinating is I think that if I if I had to guess the way that they're making the the way that she looks they're using AI to come up with like the ideal uh like the ideal person that both men and women are attracted to or like want to like follow and be into and I follow her boyfriend and he's super skinny and he's little and drag like androgynous and I'm like [ __ ] they don't like yoke boys anymore like you know these and so it's kind of funny to see like what they're like making is like the ideal person it's very fascinating but the business is making a lot of money I believe well on this pod a while back I had said uh somebody needs to create a deep fake only fans model because I was like oh you could just have a virtual only fans model that even kind of looks a little virtual that's okay and now this is just a money maker for you right you're like basically like some sort of virtual pimp if you created these these AI only fans characters and a guy did it so so a guy reached out and um and so he created it he's like he basically used his girlfriend who's like a model or whatever as the model for it and then created a AI clone of her and now we're like setting it up and we're gonna see how it goes so I'm really curious to see if this thing like takes off or not so are you actually interested in this business are you are you gonna be oh my God this is uh so interesting to see if this works or not yeah but like how do you work with like softcore porn all day I'm not doing anything I'm just like getting the update he just DMS me and says check this out and he'll be like you know we got the account made or we're gonna you know he'll start sending me updates on how much money they're making right I just want to see how it how the experiment turns out I don't have to sit there and like train her think about the investor updates that will sends he's like you know here's like screenshots of our new prototype you know like we've effectively we've we've gotten uh people's REM sleep to improve by five percent by just adding this little feature here's a mock-up and they're like What's it gonna look like to you it's gonna look great I don't know I don't see what the problem is well that's that's actually a so a theme that I think about is like okay 50 years from now what are things that the the future generational look back at our generation and say oh that was so crazy that that was happening then like there's a lot of easy versions of that for us today right where it's you know you can say smoking on uh you know smoking on airplanes or um you know the number of people that died giving birth or uh you know uh people dying from just traveling across the country right like so there's all these examples of that and then if you try to pull it forwards what would they say about things that feel sort of a little too normalized today and yeah what what are things that your grandkids will say like really Grandpa like you know slavery and you're like I don't know it was just the norm back then right like what are those what are those things today that 50 years from now will seem either like crude or rude or whatever in some way right like I think the health monitoring is an obvious one it's like you just didn't know how you were doing and it's like yeah we just didn't know you go to the doctor once a year maybe and like yeah they just randomly measured my blood pressure once a year right that was that was my checkup that's that's to me the most obvious one that will seem like wow you guys were really capable you just rolled the dice with that one huh your whole your whole Health thing and that that's just going to be so different in the future the number of people that die from car accidents seems like it would be on that list dude I was driving last night on a late night like two one lane road and a huge truck went by me and I it shook my car and we were both going 80 miles an hour like you know passing each other and it does seem in about 20 years it's gonna be so archaic we're like can you believe that we are basically one sneeze away from like an 80 miles an hour like car crash all the time like you just just literally 10 feet away five feet away sometimes it it that is good that's gonna be that's Gonna Be Our Generations smoking section in restaurants that that cars two cars going that's really it's gonna be like smoking or non-smoking like you used to drive these cars going in opposite directions and you were 10 feet away from each other that's what it's going to be like I think and like my wife is vegan and she's like yeah like that the thing that's gonna be you know the 50 years from now is like you just killed animals and ate them like what what why like that you just thought that was I bet it's like dude I bet Will's got a total opposite take out here yes that's what I wanted to hear what's your take on uh sort of like vegan carnivore plant-based you know all these different you know ver more extreme versions of diets have you seen anything or where where's your head at it was the data say around that the data says it's highly personal uh so you could put two people on identical diets and they could have literally the exact opposite effects on those on those people I remember uh I mean take professional athletes for example that you guys remember when LeBron got really skinny it was like around the Olympics yeah and it was you'd been playing with Ray Allen so Ray Allen got him to go on the Paleo diet and because Ray Allen was obsessed with the paleo diet and again it's an example it was amazing for Ray terrible for LeBron like terrible uh and so there's every version of that for uh for the rest of us for me personally I.E uh I ate three meals a day I try not to eat crap uh I eat carbs I I've you know I would say I have like a Mediterranean type diet a lot of meats and fishes and vegetables um I don't really drink that many calories mostly drink water and coffee so so that's my diet I also think diet is easier if you like the right things and then you can kind of eat as much as you'd like or as much as fills you up versus having to count calories in part because a lot of the calories you consume are really bad calories so those are my quick perspectives on diet dude have you seen well have you seen um Brian Johnson do you know who that is yeah the uh uh he created a really cool or is creating a very cool company um that measures brain waves yeah yeah but have you seen blueprint well that's his whole age reversal uh he's like a human he's like a human whoop band yeah yeah he wears whoop and uh and so that's how I know him and uh he's come on the podcast before I think he's coming on actually soon is his uh is he like in the is he in the top like one percent of of data because if not he's doing a hell of a lot of [ __ ] with his lifestyle if that doesn't work if that doesn't give him some off the charts readings on his uh on his sleep and his his strain then I don't know well I want to be clear that I don't have access to every single person on whoops data but but uh I think some of the stuff we went over because he was on a podcast maybe a year or two years ago and he was telling me some pretty good stats then and it sounds like he's dialed it in even more sense so I'll definitely listen to the podcast you guys through them well so listen to this Sean this just happened I think this morning it was released so basically he was on our pod and he looks like a freak you know like he's like chiseled he looks awesome and I don't know how old he is actually he's like yeah yeah but he like he's he's looks great and but you know he does all this insane stuff that you'd expect a billionaire to be able to do he's got like a 30 doctors like helping him do all this he's he he you know whatever well it just released that or it was just released that you can spend I think like a lot like a 1.5 or 2 million dollars a year and you basically can he's gonna like anyone can use his doctors and go through his system in order to what he's trying to do for the listeners is he's basically it's kind of like this thought exercise but he's taking it seriously which is he's trying to reverse his age which you can do through like improving your blood and losing weight things like that so reverse his biological age faster than his chronological chronological age goes up because in theory if you do that you live forever obviously that won't happen but it's like an interesting like thought exercise but now anyone can sign up and apply to use like all the crazy [ __ ] that he's doing you're gonna do it Sam it's like two million dollars a year no um also like I have a here I have a thing with all the fitness people and Brian I I called Brian out for this and he actually answered it well but I'm like do you ever experience Joy like like like like so I don't drink alcohol and a lot of people say like oh I've been wanting to do that and I'm like well do you have a problem and they go no I just thought I've been like then what like it sounds dope then just get drunk every once in a while that like you know that's like a that's like a life worth living is like when you have things to celebrate and like you can build camaraderie with your friends like yeah just do it you might live a little shorter you might be sick for a few days but like you know like experience Joy that's good and so with Brian I was like Hey do you ever like have birthday cake for your kid's birthday like do it he's like no I've only cheated like once one meal over like two years or something like that and I was like well you happy and he said I'm happy so my opinion of as okay great you're winning but for most people I don't know experience Joy a little bit like be healthy and also like get effed up every once in a while I think that's good advice will I have a I have a similar thing that you'll just you'll you'll hate slash disagree with which is uh on my Twitter I have this tweet that's pinned that just says here's some semi-controversial things that I believe and one of them is um you don't need a sleep tracker great sleep is obvious and uh I think you would probably disagree because it's kind of the premise of your life right now but you gotta admit pretty catchy and there's some nugget of wisdom in there there's some nugget of Truth in that in that belief just because it sounds good doesn't mean it's true yeah I mean I think that might be true in like extremely binary terms you know oh I had to wake up for a 4 a.m flight or uh you know uh the the alarm kept going off last night like yeah okay those are bad nights of sleep but I I think it's it's a profound lie in the sense of if you're actually trying to understand your nightly sleep and routine like I think there's just a lot it's a think about it this way it's a third of your life that is a complete Black Box you have no idea what's happening during that third of your life and and science has proven that that's a third of your life that dramatically affects the other two-thirds and if you're good at sleeping it decreases every form of potential disease that you can have like it is the magic pill so I don't agree with your Tweet but I respect tweets tons of Retreats right we do it for the retweets around here and uh I I do think that that Sam's points are good what good one though as it applies to a tweet which is if you make all these things seem you know like discipline in spite of Joy or or sort of soulless uh then then of course there's some kind of a rebellion against it right and so I've heard people talk about sleep tracking in a way that makes sleep tracking seem profoundly not cool and and so I understand it through that lens but I think the reality is you can measure things about your body passively that give you a great insight into you into your life and make your life better right yeah okay so what do you think's gonna happen well 10 years what's your what's the what's the vision here you're gonna go public you're gonna sell this for 10 billion dollars what do you think is going to happen I think we'll ultimately go public uh I think that it'll probably be sooner than that time frame that you gave and I think we're gonna build technology that's able to predict a lot of massive life events uh as they pertain to your health and and along the way provide a 24 7 coach that uh helps people meet their goals well beyond Health you know psychological goals professional goals uh just because of the the value that understanding your body can provide dude you've stuck it in the face of all the finance Bros you're saying I didn't have to go that route and I still crushed it I think that's awesome I've got so many New Year friends and they just in uh Long Island friends and they do the same thing over and over and over again I'm like you're selling your soul man this is the worst and uh it's so cool that you kind of saw that route is not maybe for you and you you're gonna just crush it uh we're big fans of whoop um I've never tested the aura ring so I've been loyal to to my whoa uh I've been calling it I call it whoop and whoop so my apologies I actually didn't know the right way to pronounce yeah what is the right way food I could like kind of like whoop too like I would never say I'm a whooping ass today so you know like I kind of I don't know yeah the founder of it or Sam yeah what do you know if you wear it inside out it's whoop yeah I never knew how you pronounced it but my wife and I have our our paid subscribers how much should we I think we pay you 300 a year I don't even remember dude I paid you for two years and I just didn't have my band I lost my band and then I just kept the subscription going so you know you're welcome on that one but now I got my band back and now I'm getting the value yeah yeah if you reach out to membership services they'll send you a band no problem if you're a subscriber the Hardware's included I mean that was one of the more that was like obvious now in hindsight but uh in 2018 we changed the whole business model to being a subscription where the hardware was included how much was that like a huge I mean your economics drastically change totally I mean we used to sell the product for 500 one-time fee everything included then we went to you can sign up for as little as thirty dollars like picture the just all the cash implications gross margin implications everything that happens almost overnight when you do that and it was also about the business moment because okay companies founded in 2012. if you're changing your business model that profoundly six or seven years later you're also admitting you haven't figured out the right business model six or seven years into building a company so uh yeah that was all that was all quite quite uh painful and concerning but we you know we created a really cool business model that that now has been amazing yeah now you're gonna get maybe you can make you're gonna make an argument I don't know if you're gonna get it but you're gonna make an argument that you get those SAS multiples yeah and then I think there's a fair case for that yeah I don't know what your churn is but that'd be that'd be badass because I mean that's that's you know five times more valuable company um well dude this is awesome yeah thanks for coming on we took you a little over time sorry about that but uh but thanks for coming on will this is this is fun and uh yeah everybody go get some sleep and by the way Sean right from you that's a big pivot well I I said great sleep is important I just said great sleep is obvious uh you know directionally you know which way you're going whether you track it or not and then once you get once you get going in the right direction then start measuring it and optimizing it did you have a Twitter thread that was killing uh clubhouse get him that blood is on my hands yes wow that's yeah how's that what do you think on point and all the clubhouse investors who blocked me because they thought I was just being a hater you know the um my door has a little mail slot for apologies and uh they're welcome to go ahead and slip the slip the apology back in yeah no I'm connecting the dots on some tweets of yours that I've I've read now uh because I also remember that sleep one I think about it that was my version of the of the clubhouse thread for you uh I don't know that business very well but it certainly seems like it's uh not doing as well as it was in the middle of Kobe well I think what a hypocrite Sean is by the way he's got he owns a whoop yeah whoop whoop he owns a he owns a loop and he's still saying you don't need a sleep tracker that's [ __ ] man call him out will yeah well I I definitely will now well I'm waiting for the version that like just Auto charges or like stays charged for like two years so I can just leave it on because uh I'm a notorious lose [ __ ] guy so you know I'm on my 18th airpods I uh you know I've gone through three whoop bands and uh it's the charging that gets me every single time same what's the plan dude is a 30-day charge gonna happen anytime soon or is it for a guy to get an infinite battery around here yeah just do better and by the way the the modular battery pack I think was a good Innovation at least so you don't have to take it off but but uh you know originally I was hoping we'd be able to do it like watches were there certain watches first movement yeah keep it alive the reality is that because we collect so much Health Data we're driving the battery pretty hard and the sensor is pretty hard so uh in some ways it's great that we've gotten to four or five days but but uh customer feedback heard okay we'll work on the two-year model for both of you no that's been my same thing which is that's why I don't wear an Apple Watch is I think it's so stupid that you have to charge those things all the time I think dude I lost my wedding ring on my honeymoon because I just lose everything same I had I got mine tattooed on my hand because I lost it so much I'm not smart enough to get away with this absent-minded Professor [ __ ] where it's like oh he's so messy but he's brilliant it's like he's you know you know above average it's like that doesn't have the same doesn't have the same uh you know excuse power for me that's all right you're you're good enough that you can screw up every once in a while but uh yeah the battery thing man you guys got to figure that out but we have I think we have Will's email in the calendar invite so Sean you just gotta you're just gonna message him hey Will lost my band please hook up thanks right I will delete mail I'll delete tweet affair well losing it because they wear it all the time so you must be taking it off too I got also got little kids and my little kids are like oh bracelet toy you know they just think it's the theirs and so they just steal it when it's charging on the counter and they now I lose it so you know whatever well dude thanks for doing this um your uh your PR guy John is my good buddy John uh hooked us up with um uh Ariel helwani you like UFC uh Ariel and John are good buddies and Ariel's like the face of like UFC journalism he hooked us up with that he made the introduction to you so uh we we owe him a shout out but I appreciate you coming on this is awesome are you big UFC fan oh yeah we both are yeah we're both huge into it are you uh I'm not a huge fan but I mean I observe it uh from a distance I I think the athletes are like you know some of the more uh impressive physical specimens in the world yeah besides the whole brain thing besides that they gotta put that away that's just what I I slapped dude that is the dumbest thing man on the slap League what that is so I wanted to be here I watched three minutes of the preview and I was like you just when I thought I was out Dana White you got me backing dude that is the dumbest thing ever are you really are a fan of that no one's saying it's I think it's adorable you know and they get knocked out so for those listening who don't know we're talking about it's basically I think they have weight classes but it's usually always like the big old fat guys looking like they're supposed to be strong but they look huge and they just stand in front of each other and they smack each other five times right is that the rule it's five slaps and but they almost always get knocked out it looks like yeah you just take turns open hand slapping each other but the slap is like a thud it's not like a slap it's a basically a punch and uh yeah it basically results in a brutal knockout like every every single match which is pretty crazy it's and then their faces are so swollen have you seen that like when their jaws are so small dude and they wear earplugs because they will rupture your eardrum you know if you've ever gotten hit in the earlier Sam did you see the trailer for it like they released the preview that was like supposed to Hype you up introduce the league and they're like these people come from you know everywhere they come from nothing this guy was doing this now this has given him this opportunity and he's still alive and then one guy goes I just want to change the world man change the world one slap at a time brother what are you doing we're democratizing slap Chris Nowitzki who's done all this concussion research uh uh at Boston University is one of the the key guys from for doing concussion research in the NFL he he was in the WWF wasn't he he was like a professional wrestler yeah and he had a bunch of concussions and uh and he was like it's it's just half a step from um having people just stab each other on live TV and then saying who makes it yeah we should also give get ratings right there's this idea of pain fatainment you ever heard this term it's basically I get the idea of it from yeah it's a great great name for that reason right which is we love entertainment of people suffering you know and so like whether this is TV shows like Survivor or Naked and Afraid or whatever where they have to suffer in that way or it's somebody suffering uh in an emotional way when you're watching Dr Phil or Jerry Springer and somebody finds out they got cheated onto their Maury tells them they are not the father whatever there is a you know they used to have executions publicly and people would come and watch the execution literally like you know whatever in France in the old days and so there's this long history of people enjoying stuff watching suffering uh as a form of entertainment and uh it's this crazy thing but it's it's something that that does exist I'm not saying it's good or bad but like uh I do think it's uh I do think it's gonna work for that reason there's some Darkness there yeah well thanks for making this happen dude we appreciate it yeah this was fun thanks for having me guys yeah we'll uh we'll be in touch because you know I'm gonna be emailing you all my complaints about my warp but uh and maybe I'll be one of your investors whenever you IPO but this is awesome and we appreciate it do you uh you can give a shout out by the way what's your do you use social media at all well I'm at her are my handles well thanks for making this happen we really appreciate it we'll talk soon they will talk soon guys cool [Music] thank you

every time I've had a company sale when we sold bbo to twitch when we just sold the milk Road you have been our we call the deal Doula you help us you know go through that labor process and come out the other side with you know the happy ending I [Music] guess suly welcome to my first million uh you're subbing in for for S part today and like every substitute teacher it's always the best when they're there um we we're going to do a bunch of things we're going to talk about some of your the companies you started companies you've invested in things are you know some ideas you have you were the first ever episode of the podcast so if people want to hear your life story that's the place to go episode number one um we've come a long way from there did you think this is what would happen uh I always knew the podcast was going to be big and uh I think from the very beginning you were like let's do bar stol except for business and that's what it's become and it's huge and I actually think it's going to be way bigger in a year than it is today like three times the size a year from now than it is today uh yeah I hope so that's the uh that's the goal uh we did the kind of barol thing except without hiring anybody it was like okay we will just be the jackasses and then like Let it go from there um all right so I got you sent me this doc which is great because there's a bunch of topics on here that I kind of want to jump into you uh I guess we should set the the the the like groundwork here so I'll give you a very short life story so people understand who you are you um you worked at a job for like a couple years you did like the traditional path you worked at Microsoft you quit you decided to start your own company this is right when the Facebook app platform comes out so you start building like silly Facebook apps that go viral so uh think things like superlatives which was um like which of your friends is most likely to do X and uh it would invite those friends to like do it too and it grew like crazy but it was like a silly Facebook app so you didn't know what to do with it but you ended up selling it so you got that was your kind of my first million moment so you sell it um you're how old at that time like 24 25ish 26 maybe uh yeah 26 26 take that and you go on the next big wave which is uh mobile apps are going to be a thing you are creating games I think maybe first on Facebook and then on the iPhone when when the iPhone app store comes out you're like oh this is going to be big you create a company called tiny uh or tiny Co and um end up somehow you raise money from andreon Horwitz you're living the dream things go south as the economics of that business change and then you go all in in this Hail Mary strategy which again episode one for the whole story you go all in on this hail Mar strategy of like we're going to get the rights to Family Guy and you end up some how as a startup that nobody's ever heard of getting the rights to the license to to make the Family Guy mobile game you did it for Harry Potter and a couple other big IP things sell that company um and then that I met you after that so I met you kind of when you were selling that thing we met at a a dinner that Sam was throwing cuz you were speaking at hustle con and immediately we hit it off we were we made some big plans we were like you know you were talking about Tony Robbins I was like oh I'm a Tony Robbins guy you're like really I don't even know about Tony Robbins tell me I started gushing about my experience there whatever and I was like yeah we should do that here in San Francisco like let's do it tomorrow morning let's have a our own power session with people like us who were just you know electric and uh yeah we were like uh Tony Robbins is amazing nobody is doing this um in this kind of modern way let's put up some Facebook ads today um and then tomorrow let's have 50 people in here and try our hand at like being Tony Robbins for a day we did the thing where you spent 20 minutes being like this is great this is a great idea this is this is a no-brainer and we just keep talking about how much it's a no-brainer how much it's a Sam dunk we're going to do it we're using all these terms never did it 10 years later we've still never did it but we became good friends along the way I still think it's a great idea and it would be the most fun weekend ever yeah I think I still think we should do it we uh but then we we kind of got uh I guess from there you you did a couple things so your brother started native deodorant you kind of helped him with that you started another company which we don't talk too much about then I was starting my e-commerce brand you have helped me out a lot with that and are kind of a a shareholder in that business um and when we were every time I've had a company sale when we sold bbo to twitch when we just sold the milk Road you have been our we call the deal Doula you help us you know go through that labor process and come out the other side with you know the happy ending I guess um so that that's kind of like how our interactions have been like on a business side and then become great friends uh since then so that's my intro did I miss anything um I love being the deal d by the way uh when we sold tinyo we had this Banker named dick filipini and he uh ran he was our Banker ran the transaction for us and I told him that I loved what he did so much that I just wanted to work for him for free for six months after this so I could see all of the deals that he was doing and uh he did not accept my offer and said no you you can't do this dick is great he helped us for free when cuz bio was the bio deal was going to be too small he does bigger deals like I think like $100 million do plus type deals um it was too small but he got on the phone with me several times that the process talked me off a ledge multiple times when I was like I'm just going to say this he's like no well you should probably just wait see what they say um and his advice was basically just like don't F this up you know son and he was totally right he helped me a ton and actually I still feel the guilt that I didn't like send him a gift after I think I texted you like a year later I was like what's Dick's address I need to send him a gift I can't believe I didn't and here I am still four years later have not send that gift dick I'm so sorry you were so helpful and I will I will still send you this gift the deal another deal that dick did that I thought was super interesting was he sold app Loven to a Chinese company for uh $1 billion and the Trump Administration blocked the deal or the FTC blocked the deal and uh instead of it being a bill dollar sale the Chinese company invested $100 million into App 11 and then couple years later App 11 so everyone I thought would be devastated like the founders were like we're going to become so rich overnight as we sell this company for a billion bucks transaction doesn't happen I assume Founders are sad and upset then a couple years later the company goes public and at some point it was worth $30 billion as a publicly traded company so such an amazing transaction to not have have uh closed well they got the best of both because they whatever the company was putting I think it was 1.6 was the original 1.4 1.6 was the original purchase price and they were going to put in a few hundred million dollars to own 70 or 80% of it and then instead it was like the year went by nothing happens and so with that anxiety came this big payoff because the business grew like crazy in that time so they're like hey okay same deal but now you own like 20 or 30% and so they got the money they got liquid on that but they only had to give up a tiny fraction and then they sold it then they went public um you know later for for way more so that turned out you know pretty much as good as it could go right like scario uh just had to wait a year um speaking of kind of like Acquisitions I got I have a milk Road related question for you first which is um you saw you saw both the Acquisitions that I did from like sort of start to end and I shared you know it's like in high school when it's like the boy texted me this should I reply this should I say this like no no no that looks too needy say that like change the period to a comma and then just you know cut that last line like it's that level of help that that you were doing with me um what's your I've given kind of my debrief of the acquisition I'm just curious what's your uh what was your takeaway or what was your what are some nuggets that that you would you would share from uh from watching that go down um I love the deal structure that uh milk Road ended up with which was a bunch of cash up front and then um a bunch equity in the new company where those two guys are wanting to grind it out for years and build a giant business and uh those guys in my head you know some percentage of the work that they do is just creating value for you and Ben and that's awesome so I love that deal structure uh the in my head uh kind of having been through this a couple times I feel like a lot of the um you know text the new Nuance of words that you care about when you're trying to sell your business the buyer doesn't care about that much um and it's more of a emotional thing than a practical thing where practically the buyer is like I want to buy this business because of the Strategic reason and the revenue and the profit and a lot of the things that um you can be squeamish about or uncomfortable to say or not sure how to say things um I think a lot of that stuff doesn't matter one of the things that I learned uh actually when I was trying to sell tinyo was um we ran a sales process where I was trying to sell the business and we talked to a bunch of uh acquirers and we got pretty far along with one um and then the deal didn't happen uh and then a year later we went and sold the company um successfully and the um there was a bunch of stuff that I was trying to keep close to the chest and I was like oh people aren't going to want to hear this people aren't going to want to hear that and what was great about a banker and some somebody like dick was uh he was like no actually this isn't a big deal just tell these guys this and uh they're not going to care about that so it took uh this kind of un discomfort I had around like things I thought were secrets that I needed to take to the Grave with me and he just made me comfortable telling them about that Sam Sam did something for me in this process so as we were selling the milk red I was like yo any kind of tips or advice you've had in when he sold the HubSpot and he goes oh on that same note he goes just do uh just tell them up front all the shitty things about your business that they that might scare them away cuz guess what they're going to find those anyways when it comes to due diligence and you're just going to be you know four weeks in or 6 weeks in emotionally invested and it's going to get ugly later and they're going to feel like they found some like you know big wart on the deal at that point in time um and he goes just tell them all the skeletons your closet now and be like here's all the reasons you shouldn't buy this company if these bother you you now know them and you can decide for yourself you know if that's a deal breaker for you this was like not the very first thing but shortly after like we went to a dinner and everybody was interested we hadn't even fully negotiated the deal but I just said they're like you know any questions you guys have or you know any any concerns I said well you know I want to make sure like you fully understand this business um and you know I've been through this a couple times and I just I know like um it's better to just be fully transparent so I said you know here's all uh I made a list of the reasons why you know you shouldn't buy this here's all the skeletons in our closet and you can look at these today and you could you can decide if this is too um too concerning for you you know let's talk through these now and we did it and later after the deal was closed we did a debrief and they they basically this is how you know they're smart they were like what could we have done better in the acquisition process like you know from your point of view and we we asked the same it's like how was that for you uh was that good for you it was good for me and it was like we we told them uh they told they gave me that feedback they were like you know you said something at this dinner where you were just like here's all the ugly parts of our business and like let we just tell you about them and we could talk through them they go that built so much trust cuz we didn't know you very well and immediately we were like oh okay we felt we felt at ease and um we felt like we could trust you guys going forward and so that turned out to be a big win and that's the exact opposite my you know I think the entrepreneurs instinct is hide that you know as far put it behind your back you know if they if they if they ask for it you show them but like don't scare them away and in and in fact what you want to do is like find out as quickly as possible if there's a real match here or not and use that as a tool to build trust uh versus to build distrust by not disclosing it up front the other thing I've seen entrepreneurs do that I I um think is also kind of uh the wrong Common Sense out there is uh when you ask an entrepreneur if they want to sell their business entrepreneurs are told to say no I do not want to sell my business and they expect that the buyer is going to come over the top and say even if you don't want to sell your business we're super interested in buying it we'll do anything it takes uh please come talk to us and in practice that's not at all how it works uh often times a buyer is looking at a bunch of different businesses to buy at that point in time and so they'll reach out or talk to 10 different businesses five of them will say no we're not for sale and they'll say okay great we're knocking these five off we're going to focus on the five that have said yeah we are for sale right and so what's the way to say yes without seeming desperate there or seeming too too eager to sell because you don't want to do that either I think the way I've done it before is um one when I was ready to sell a business I would uh find somebody that I knew was interested but wouldn't have a good offer and get them to make an offer and then say cool uh go that enables you to reach out to other people and say hey we have an offer to sell the business and we're thinking about uh whether or not to do that and you are somebody that we think there's a great strategic fit with so we thought to talk to you before we did something else yeah yeah so kind one way to do it if they come inbound it's sort of like um you know we have had interest and nothing you know nothing felt felt right you know we really like our business um but you know we respect you guys and if that's something you you know we we'll obviously be open to listening uh you know we we we owe ourselves that right and so so you kind of you just say we like our business we had interest it hasn't we we didn't really nothing went too far because we weren't very you know weren't too keen on it but you know really like you if you want to talk like we're open to talking there's no you know that's fine yeah um yeah I think that's a good setup and uh I think buyers who are experienced can kind of read between the lines pretty quickly uh because what you just said is like I'm wide open somebody please ask me out for a date I'll I'm ready uh you know and I'll be a cheap date sign me up exactly but like it's the signal it's the signal that I'm interested without like um without begging you uh but it's like to be clear I'm interested yeah yeah it's perfect it's like looking at somebody across the bar for and catching their eyes um their eyes for one second and then smiling and looking away there was a another meeting we won't talk we won't name the name but you were a part of a few of the meetings as we talked to different people from milk road and it was the first meeting with one of the buyers and you you immediately called me afterwards and you were like wow and then you said uh there's this phrase a fool and his money are easily parted and you immediately sniffed out that this person was sort of an idiot um and like you know would would would be and sure enough they made the by far the largest offer um and you know turned out to be you know they turned out to be not not exactly who we didn't go with them because that but of of the three or four people that we talked to this was one of them but you sniffed that out immediately what what tipped that off for you and uh what can you say without getting us into too much trouble um you know there's a lot of people who are charlatans nowadays and uh they'll often lead with a lot of like flattery and not substance um like it's very easy for me to tell when somebody is like hey this is who I am I've done XY I started this company I sold it I started this company it didn't work out they're just like honest about their resume and there isn't tremendous amounts of puffery that with a Google searches you can be like actually that's all not true right and that's what happened with you've said a lot of words but you haven't said anything yet okay that is uh you know either I'm not understanding what you're trying to say or you have nothing to say basically yeah that's right and they don't lead with like numbers and information they lead with uh like flowery language that doesn't go anywhere so I'm curious um what are some business ideas that uh you think somebody could start that would be successful either at the smaller scale like I think this can be you know like a clear business that'll make a few million bucks that I just think you know if somebody out there's looking for a way to get Financial Freedom this is a way to here's a big idea somebody who is willing to grind that out should go do this um the big idea that I like the most right now is um Robin Hood for Real Estate so uh you know Robin Hood makes it easy to invest in uh the stock market um and the way I thought about this is I've got a ton of friends who are you know in their 20s that work at uh Facebook or Google and they make a ton of money but uh what they do with it is they just stick it in their uh bank account or in a savings account or a CD uh sometimes they'll invest in the stock market um I think it's so hard to be able to invest in real estate and there was a turnkey way through a mobile app to be able to invest into real estate uh I think that would be huge and I think it's really different you you did this um investment and I followed you uh in a company called jar in India and so they make it super easy to invest in gold in India and so you can invest with a dollar or $50 or $5,000 and just buy gold like a one click it's just if you believe that gold is a good thing to invest will make it easy for you to do that thing that you already think is a good idea exactly and so it's a oneclick thing of like how much money do I want to invest today and then uh they the best way to do it is to kind of set up a subscription where every month you're like cool I'm buying $200 of gold every month and 10 years from now it's going to be worth millions of dollars uh I think the same should happen with real estate there's a bunch of companies that are like cadra and um funr or Crow Street whatever those are like but you have to look at the individual deals you have to they're targeted towards um people like me who like investing in real estate and who are sophisticated about it and want to know what it what the cap rate is and the location and the year of construction and all this stuff um I think there should be a oneclick way to be able to go buy equity in rental properties that generate income and uh it should be marketed to um people in their 20s it should be marketed through Facebook it should be set up so that every you basically log in and are like cool you want to invest in real estate how much do you want to invest every month $200 great $200 is now happening in real estate you're now investing $200 in real estate every month and boom it does an a from your account every month on on the customer side and invest in that real estate and the income that's gets generated go goes back and reinvests in more real estate and that's it and so it shows uh this is how much you've invested so far and here's how much it's worth boom okay love it give me more what else you got uh what else do you got hey hey hey hey whoa who who what's going on here this is the you're the you're the guest of honor here I got uh I'm dumping ideas every week here I'll give you one that like I think is I'll give you one that I get asked a lot which is not actually what's a big idea but what's the easiest way to get to like a million dollars um and I always think that like the easiest way to get to a million dollars if I'm if I need to get to a million dollars right now here's here's what I would do I would um I would create an agency that's going to Target a really specific part of a business that makes money already and just figure out how to make more of it so for example email marketing for uh e-commerce brands or conversion rate optimization for for companies so you basically say hey visitors coming to your site we can help you convert more of that traffic into sales and I think there's such an easy play where you basically just create content so you create content that basically just says like here's the before and here's the after look I changed these three things because I call this my you know my hot cold hot method and um we boosted Revenue by 32% by the way if you want somebody to boost your Revenue by 32% work with me and I think that this is like a such a bootstrap easy way to get to 100K a month in Revenue right like you get 10 clients paying you 10K a month it is not hard to get 10 customers to pay you 10K a month when it's um a part of their business that's already going to produce like already producing hundreds of thousands of if not millions of dollars of Revenue and you're going to provide you know the turnkey service so you take it off you take the headache off their plate but you do it better than they're doing it because you're you get seen as a thought Leader by putting out like 10 of these case studies and this this happens all the time with ad agencies um email agencies conversion rate optimization agencies but you could do this with anything you could do this with sight speed you could do this with like any number of things so I would just go and you could start with start at zero and become a quote unquote thought leader expert just by publishing like very simple before and after like kind of case studies um and you start by not even having a client you say hey if I was this brand here's what I would do look when they do this it sucks uh you know they this is a dead end for them or you know they should steal this good idea from this other company and so you could put together case studies without even having clients and so to me this is like the easiest like if you are willing to work hard and you feel stuck at a job that maybe pays you 100K a year and you're looking how do I go from 100K to 900k how do I go from 100K to to you know 750k a year this is the like all all it takes is hustle uh approach to to that side of type of business and then those businesses can be sold so like your job you can't be you can't sell your job right like if I write a book I might write that that might be the title you can't sell your job just like my my on line case for why you should start a business instead of have a job and if you get a business like this to 900k and you know 60% profit you could sell that agency or that Consulting business for maybe two or three times you know IA and so you could sell that you could make 600 to 800k a year and then sell it for 2 or three million um you know after a couple years and so that's a very easy Pathway to Financial Freedom easy meaning it's simple not not that it's no effort but easy that like anybody can do it and it doesn't take being the genius with the one idea who beats all the competitors in the space yeah I totally agree with that I think there's a bunch of other examples in my head like um just setting up a Facebook pixel and doing in a way that's actually optimized um and perfect and following all the Facebook guidelines I think that's super hard and I think there should be some guy who's like I'm the expert at this right um and I take care of that for you and I gave a brand of e-commerce but like you can also do this for just hey everyw legal practice every dentist you need websites I make websites for dentists right so it doesn't even need to be like you're the best at doing growth for D Toc Brands it could be like hey in Minneapolis Minnesota I make the best websites for restaurants in Minneapolis Minnesota or legal practices whatever and just through cold email or you know some communist C Emil LinkedIn referrals you can like get 10 customers to pay 10K a month yeah I think you could pick any of these um big sectors of the economy like accounting law medicine Dental um be anything Senior Living could whatever you know yeah yeah and I'm just going to go and build a online thing that um makes their life easier through marketing to them making it easy to make a website uh it's insane how many of those old world businesses are still like don't have a good website right don't do any Google ads um so I think our friend Nick Huber does this thing where he's like he basically has a Playbook to make a self- storage unit run better and so his thing is like I'll buy it at some multiple but I know I can run it at 30% more efficiently or 40% more efficiently so I'm getting value I know within 9 months I have a turnkey process to make this thing generate 30 40 % more e and so he does that buying the properties but you could also just take that Playbook and say hey Self Storage owner I will do this for you I'll do it risk-free for you man you pay me nothing unless I deliver this outcome if I increased your Revenue by 30% or your your your net profit by 30% that would be you know that would be great right and here's my playbook I do these three things you would agree that you're not doing those three things today very well right okay fantastic how about I deliver those to you risk-free and when I do I get to keep you know half the value for the first year and then it drops down to 10% after that and you could do this for Senior Living you could do this for Self Storage you could do this for any business that's like out there once you find a good like whatever best practices this is what Alex Heros did with his gym launch thing he's like hey gym owner you want more customers like he used to own his own gym developed best practices and then realized the the value was not in his gym being run with best practices but taking the best practice and selling it to all gym owners and so that's what he that's what he did and I think you could do that with like pretty much any any Niche business what do you think about Niche content creators and kind of trying to build the same thing by creating content in a specific Niche like um you know eco-friendly sustainable products that kind of thing so what would somebody do there so I'm a I'm a content creator what am I doing there in in this example um making YouTube videos Instagram video Instagram reals and Tik toks about um that content for for the business to marketing to business owners as like hey business owner here's what you should do to no not to business owners to Consumers just being like this is how I live a sustainable lifestyle um kind of pick anything that you're passionate about and make a bunch of YouTube videos about it or content about it and I think that can be a big business like you know Doug deiro with cars right um see I I don't like those as much because I a I think it's a good thing to do because good things come of it I don't think they're very reliable at creating successful businesses most content creators don't make successful businesses right so if you just look empirically at the numbers you're just like okay of the 2 million twitch streamers and of the 10 million YouTubers like Who's Making Over 10K a year and the number is like astronomically small um and so you know the problem with those is that everybody wants to do that and there's not a clear way to like get the value out um it is good to do because you will learn you'll become good at content you'll meet cool people it'll lead you to the thing most likely but it's not usually directly the thing um when it's consumer facing if it's business facing I think it's pretty easy then to say oh yeah I mark it to the owners of self- storage units I create the best content for them you know you could go that's what Nick charma did right Nick charma's like hey I'm gonna write the best newsletter for a Ecommerce store owner and I'm just going to put together awesome information case studies deals whatever for them and like that's not for the consumer it's for the business owner and he created you know what what should be like a $5 to $10 million your business when it's fully mature um doing just that and I think you could do that for basically the owner of any business construction businesses you know whatever any know doctors lawyers whoever any any type business if you if you focus on that you you get good at doing that so I think that one I like I don't like the consumer facing one as much because I think the numbers would show that they don't make very much money the way that they currently do them and like you know I I have this problem too where it's like um what's the most competitive thing is like being like a content creator what what are most people doing from like you know even like a 12-year-old can do it and I have this problem myself where I'm like oh I want to create a bunch of YouTube content and I'm like man this you know I'm competing with every 15-year-old in America and they're better and faster and have more time and have nothing to lose and are willing to do way crazier stuff like wow that this might be the wrong game to compete in and I you know I'm still trying to square that for myself like is this the right game or the wrong game to even compete in um I could have said that about podcast in general too right so like you know some of the best things I've done have been like in that category and it worked out just fine um but it does feel a little strange it's like against my own business advice to like don't compete in the thing that everybody is trying to do because most likely you know you're just playing game on the game on hard mode yeah the way I've seen it done well is like um there's this guy who's a realtor in LA and um you know smalltime realtor and he started making these YouTube videos that were walking through Mansions I watch that guy he's great uh yeah and so he just like made 10 of them and were like was like this is fun and then he got access to more and more uh places and just made really high-end video walkthroughs of La mansions and you know his job was already to be a realtor so he was doing this as a way to get new clients in LA and then um as he did it more and more it became a business of its own and he stopped being a realtor and now we'll fly around the world uh because people will be like I'm trying to sell this house make a video of it and it'll go make a video and a million people will watch it in three days because he's got so many YouTube subscribers so I think where you're combining it with like a profession that you already have it probably is a good fit like there's some guy who's um SMB acquisition attorney on uh Twitter and so it's just a great way for him to get Le um yeah new customers well I also think like um I don't know if this's a good thing or bad thing but that it's that 30s age thing where it's like I used to think about a business and only look up like wow the skyscrapers are huge in this field I'm I too am going to build a skyscraper and now I'm like cool before I do that let me just go quickly look at the graveyard of people who have tried to do this and like when I was in my 20s there was no graveyard I didn't think about the graveyard I'm like music startup love it everybody loves music right like what could go wrong and then when you're in your 30s you're like don't touch meal Network startup let's do yeah I did social networks for like seven years or six years uh of my 20s because it was like the skyscraper was so attractive and like there is some beauty in just doing that not even paying attention to the graveyard like I think the people who win will just do that and it'll work and their success formula was like yeah I didn't worry about the graveyard why would I do that um but as I got older I was like man you know what's more fun than trying to build a social network like winning is really fun and so like let me just make sure that whatever I'm doing like the odds are not like 99.9% chance of failure um like that's become and if I'm going to do it okay I'll go in eyes wide open I'm going to look at the graveyard and say I'm still going to do this that's kind of what happened with the podcast like you know what I'm still going to do this even though I know that most podcasts nobody ever listens to um whereas before I did not even pay attention to that and I didn't you know but I don't I know if that's a net positive it might be a net negative actually in terms of like how uh you know the the the the strength of that kind of like the ignorance yeah there's this guy Bobby kodic who's the CEO of Activision and um he's like I can be CEO of anything I could be CEO of a toilet company or CEO of Campbell Soup the thing that matters to him is success and momentum and you know there's so many people who are like you're the CEO of a games company that's what I my entire life would be made if I could just be that and he's just like success is what matters more than anything else and I'm kind of closer to that as I've uh gotten older where I'm like um success is the thing that brings me joy more than the specific category or product that I work on the thing that I think you've done um really well Sean is you've seen friends who will have a successful business and you're like let me just clone this business in a different category like you know you did that with Sam and um the hustle with milk Road and then uh you saw an e-commerce business with Ramone and the way that he was doing it and you're like I can do this too um so I think that's a really good way to to do it that's like kind of underrated uh and most people don't do where they're like I see this person as successful um I'm just going to do the exact same Playbook but in a different product category or different sector yeah I call it having a blueprint like if I don't see that there is a blueprint of success in a category and that it is replicatable like okay I can look at how the guy started Snapchat but if but that doesn't seem very like rep yeah I can't replicate that and so but when I saw an e-commerce or I saw oh the newsletter business I thought okay not saying this is easy but I like I understand this this is simple enough for my dumb brain to get how a business like this works what does the cost what do the where's the revenue come from where does the growth come from got it um did they have some unfair Advantage did they did they start at the right time and that there's now is like you know not the right time or whatever I try to just figure that out but if there's a and so now with new things I just look for that like first we're going to go searching for a blueprint I'm going to talk to people until I find a blueprint like okay I want to uh buy companies cool Andrew Wilkinson is a good blueprint what does he do how does it work and then do I want to like do I believe that I could replicate that in my own way in my own sector of my own style um and if I don't see a blueprint I don't really get that excited at this point because I'm like why would I do it without a blueprint when I can do it with personally I'm like that or same thing if I'm going to do it without a blueprint all right that's cool but I'm going to make the announcement hey I'm choosing to do this without the blueprint and I got to go in Eyes Wide Open on that so like all of my rules I break all the time but I say them and I do them because I'm like I'm cool violating this rule but I just I'm not going to do it subconsciously I'm not going to do it blindly I'm going to do it knowingly and I'm going to make that trade you know knowing exactly what I'm trading off by making this decision versus uh you know how I you know used to do it where I didn't really I didn't even know what I was looking for um you know when it when it came to that I want to finish with some rapid fire can I do some some quick ones and then I just want you to say your reaction of this okay so I'm going to say this first category is things you've told me that I thought were funny and I want you just like react or elaborate sort of like explain this tweet um I don't know what the hell mental models are I used to think I was dumb for not knowing what mental models are now I think everybody else is dumb for thinking about on model some version of that yeah that's right um in Silicon Valley it's so in Vogue to be like Oh I'm applying the you know this cognitive bias theorem to this situation um and you know everyone in Silicon Valley that's smart talks like that and so I was just like why do I when I see something I don't see it in that same way and I just thought I was an idiot um and I always solve a problem like from scratch like tabala Raza like it's the first time I've seen it and I just like that way of doing it so I gave up trying to find mental models um all right another one you started your first two businesses on what I'll call wave so like the Facebook app app platform I think launched the same day you like had quit your job and we're like What can I do next let me just do this um you saw the announcement you're like I'll just do that I have nothing to lose um same thing with the mobile app store launch I think you were one of the first big iPhone games uh um what are the waves today what would 22-year-old suly be doing now uh probably something in genetics or um AI uh yeah probably one of those two things I it's the biggest sectors okay what um you uh seven years ago we were at dinner and I was just asked you a question I was like why haven't you were like I want to build like a big company a billion dollar company I was like why haven't you done that already uh you you're so smart you're so great why like what's what's gone wrong and you said to me I don't think I understood what a billion dollar company was before what did that mean uh I think you need to have a certain moat and uh there's a bunch of things you need to get right to build a billion dollar company you need to have a big Market you have a clear way of getting customers that um makes economic sense uh and you need um a product that's really good uh so even today I feel like I've got a very clear path to be able to build you know 100 $200 million businesses but I haven't quite figured out how to build a billion dollar business outside of taking uh five or 10 100 $200 million doll businesses I think there's a different code to build a billion dollar business than aund million doll one excellent uh what would you do if you were Mr Beast I would start a y combinator for creators and um maximize the uh basically find uh the next Kim Kardashian the next Mr Beast and uh support them and own a piece of them and be a king maker where I'm making other kings um you did a lot of startup investing I think you've pulled back some from startup investing give me the uh the the bullet point version of your take on Startup investing um I think startup invest uh I think competing for deals sucks I hate trying I find it very demeaning trying to convince somebody to let me invest $50,000 in their round uh friend of mine was raising money and got a term sheet from Andres Horowitz and Bill Gurley at Benchmark and went with the andrees Horwitz term sheet and Bill Gurley was so mad that um he called the founder up and like yelled at them for two hours and sent them 15 angry emails and uh Bill Gurley is one of the most successful people in the industry and the fact that he still has to do that made me be like this is a industry with no moat I don't want to like have to go um kind of beg or try to twist people's arms to let me invest in their startup um the other thing that's happened is trying to turn um $50,000 investments into $2 million over a 10-year period um doesn't really do anything thing for me anymore so my first startup investment ever was 100K investment a company called chart boost in 2011 or 2012 and then the company sold in 2021 and I made $2 million so that was a 10-year time span um so I I think having to wait 10 years to get uh Cash Out is really annoying and makes me like it a lot less I think the valuations have also gone really crazy um and companies are so much more competitive like uh there's a company called divy home that raised at a billion dollar valuation and there's four other divvy homes out there um that are competitors to it uh so the combination of high valuations and increased competition makes it really hard to make any money as an investor and I've evolved from being um interested in kind of making these 50k checks into trying to buy a maj majority interest or a 30 40% interest in businesses that have revenue and uh profit or a path to profit I think that's a better way to invest for me because I'll see money back and be able to take that money and reinvested in other new businesses what's the biggest investment Miss you've had and biggest hit you've had um biggest Miss was uh coinbase my uh at tinyo we had had this guy who worked for me named Adam mber he was roommates with Fred the um coinbase co-founder and so Brian Armstrong and Fred um were fundraising for their series a they got a term sheet from andri Horwitz and um Benchmark and a bunch of other firms and so they called me and said hey should we go with Benchmark should we go with Andre Horwitz uh you know we at tinyo rais money from Andre and Horwitz Mark andron was on the board and uh I was like go with Andre and Horwitz here's what's awesome about them and um on that call if I was like hey by the way can I put in 25K into this round uh I feel like they would have said yes and that 25k at their IPA was worth $200 million I think it's probably did you not ask because you didn't believe or you didn't ask CU you didn't think about it I did didn't ask cuz I didn't believe actually that's the Hest answer yeah crypto Bitcoin these guys are building PayPal for crypto and Bitcoin that's silly that's just PayPal um what about biggest hit biggest hit well let me ask you you wrote something on here you said could have invested in Facebook stock I thought you I read something that you had bought after you sold your company that was on the Facebook app platform you had bought Facebook secondary shares did you do that or or am I missing that um I did this really stupid thing uh that I'm still embarrassed of to this day which is I uh signed a contract to buy some Facebook stock like $150,000 worth and um the stock price you know it was private but in the private Market the price went down by 50% and I called my father and was like oh you know this happened to me and he was like don't worry about it just buy it and um you'll be fine it'll go back up and uh instead I didn't buy it um they Su I think they might have sued me and said hey you signed a contract to buy this and then I said okay fine I did and I paid them uh $75,000 to not buy it versus 150k to buy it yeah yeah I was 150k buy it so I paid them 75k to not buy it and I was gonna go buy um some from somebody else who was selling it and um they backed out so I didn't end up buying it and then while I was uh buying it from the other guy somebody else came to me and was like hey um I've got Facebook stock to sell too and so I hooked up a friend of mine with that Facebook stock and he bought 50k worth of stock and that 50k ended up being worth like $8 million uh for him which is kind of amazing um and uh I was actually raising a fund to be like we're just going to buy Facebook stuff yeah cuz that's what I read I after we had very first met I was like who is this guy I Googled you and I saw some article where you had sold your app on the your Facebook app and you were like it was like what are you going to do now and you're like actually I think Facebook is the good investment not like my app and you're like I'm going to just buy like millions of dollars of Facebook stock if I can um and I was like wow this guy is super aggressive and interesting like I what a great in hindsight well this was now many years later so I I was like you know wow that must have turned out amazing I didn't I never asked you about I never knew the full story yeah this was in 2008 during the great financial crisis so everyone was running away from everything and Facebook was valued at $2 billion in the private Market at the time um and you know hadn't IPO and was unclear when it would IPO um was you know probably at a 100 or 200 million Maus something along those lines um and actually I met this guy who's uh in New York City and was like hey I'm trying to buy this stock and he's like that's a brilliant idea and I was like yeah I'm trying to Ma you know get the best price possible and he's like you idiot don't worry about what price you're getting just buy from everyone who's selling it go buy it um because this price is so cheap that it doesn't matter matter don't worry about whether it's two billion or three billion or four billion just go buy buy it all and uh I just kind of [ __ ] it up yeah easier said the done for sure when those moments happen uh it's happening right now in crypto it's like I know so many people that were like H I missed it I wish I got in blah blah blah as it was going up crashes back down to you know eats at a th000 Bitcoin was at 16,000 you know like a month ago and it's like hey you know if you did want to buy like now would be a pretty good time to buy probably and they're like oh I mean this thing is who knows now and they're the same people that 3 years from now are going to be like I wish I had bought again and there're they're just never going to buy they're just going to constantly sit on the side and wish that they were buying and never buy at the times they should and always wish they could buy at the times they shouldn't that's me right now because I've got like $40 million or $50 million in US T bills that like mature every 30 days and um I'm keeping them on in like shortterm T bills because I'm like I'm going to find some other investment whether that's the S&P 500 or something else there will be other Investments and now is the time to go buy them um the a couple months ago the S&P 500 was at like 3600 and that was my trigger to go buy it and I was like ah it's going to go to 3500 I'm going to wait till 3500 it never hit 3500 I am still sitting on those T bills did not buy S&P 500 yeah very very hard to do this sort of thing but like uh maybe this is where the mental model works the cognitive bias or whatever whatever bias this is I got it uh you know there's someone out there who knows all these biases and they they're right I have all of them actually my father is really good at this in um you know I sold my first startup and made a million bucks in 2008 um he lived in Florida and was like all the St uh real estate prices here are at 25 cents on the dollar I'm going to go buy it and so he bought a house I sent him the million dollars he went and bought a house for $150,000 two weeks later that same house was selling for $75,000 if it was me I this is literally what I did I would have freaked out and said [ __ ] I don't know what I'm doing I'm going to stop this is not working instead he bought another house for $75,000 and he just kept buying houses um like for the next two years uh all the way on the way down as the stock market as the real estate prices um bottomed out it kept going down and then even on the way back up as they were increasing he would just keep buying them and so as a result he owns or we a family now owns something like 100 uh you know single family rentals in Florida and what's the line there between degenerate Gambler because I've done that too when I'm losing money and playing poker or with blackjack or whatever what's the line between degenerate Gambler and genius maybe there is no line maybe it's how the result turns out yeah I think it's a result but also it's a psychology going in where you're like I know this is going to go down I don't care because I I know I can wait 5 years or 10 years and this will go back up and he was like this is below replacement cost so if you were to build a new home right next door that was the same home it cost you four times as much as I'm paying for it right now so yeah amazing our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better you have a very honest LinkedIn and I saw a guy who I think one UPS you and I actually want to tell you about this business in a second amazing so Google this guy Justin Yoshimura so Justin and then Yoshi M so I want to read you this guy's LinkedIn he goes I'm currently the founder founder chairman and CEO of CSC Holdings one of the dime a dozen quote unquote unicorn startups so already I'm like wow unicorn startups Diamond dozen I'm trying I've been trying for 15 years to make a unicorn he's like these are diamond dozen and then he goes after being told that nobody would ever hire me I quit the bureaucracy in the neg negativity of Palos verde's high school so already just like holding a grudge against his high school to start a Marketplace for unlocked cell phones anybody who sells cell phones ringtones or any of that [ __ ] they're like the best they're great Hustlers so already you know bonus points so he's got two points first making fun of the fact that he owns he's a CEO of a unicorn second High dropped out of high school and sold unlocked cell phones he goes which was acquired by Family office when I was 19 years old more recently I started 500 friends a marketing loyalty thing we merge with whoever and eventually acquired by whatever and then he goes I Angel has 50k to 1 million in interesting companies run by interesting people then he names a bunch when he names the companies he names the round he invested in another key another key thing that only real investors and honest people do um which is that they you know you I invested in Ms in the seed round I invested this one late state right versus what most people do is they'll go buy you know Airbnb shares in the public market and call themselves an investor in Airbnb right it's like we know we know what you're doing here I've seen big Venture funds do that too where they're like oh this is a hot company we want to invest in the secondary in the series d a couple million bucks just to be able to put on our website small amount at any valuation don't care I'm just buying a logo basically yeah um so then he goes besides uh besides business and things I shouldn't be discussing on LinkedIn I love animals dogs many cats especially Persian himalayans dolphins whales he names like 10 animals manatees Turtles and he goes despite this I'm not a vegetarian Bas mainly because I lack self-discipline however I do want to clarify I don't eat any of the animals above and I would judge you for doing so especially considering that the prevent belief is that eating wild animals at wet marks is what caused Co where is where is this LinkedIn profile going and then then he goes I've been included in many vanity lists such as Forbes 30 to30 Inc 500 whatever 40 under 40 but thankfully I stopped advertising these on my LinkedIn headline when I was 19 after realized I was being a douchebag for a formal bio go to my Wikipedia so first just a deep breath to digest this guy do you know have you ever heard of this company CSC generation it's it's pretty interesting so what he did was he started buying up all these like kind of antiquated Furniture companies so it's this it's this kind of hush hush thing but they own Z Gallery which like half my house is like from zerie um he owns uh what are the other ones here one Kings Lane he Lo he owns surla lbla so he's bought like Sur laaba for 89 million z g for 20 million one King Lane and then he started making offers to buy I heard about him because um my our buddy I don't know if you know metab but metab uh sent me this link he goes this guy would be great for the Pod and metab is like 100% signal to noise ratio if he sends me something a book I instantly buy it so this was like instantly just put it on the list do research on this guy so this guy's 32 years old and he's built basically like a sort of like a billion is let's call it dollar Company Rolling these up and what he's doing is he's making them more like e-commerce and digitally like Savvy uh so he'll close down half of the retail locations that aren't performing he'll get the e-commerce side to build up he'll take all the customer data that they have and he's like dude they they have like years of customer purchasing data but it's in a machine that's like 20 years old that they can't even like literally extract and like put into an email database or like find you know put it into Facebook ads or anything like that so he's like we take this he's like we built a system to buy these companies and he's trying to build like what constellation software did for small SAS companies he's trying to do that for large furniture companies he's like he's like that's my model they built a amazing intake engine to buy like 30 30 software companies a year and like unlock more value from them I'm trying to do the same with Furniture companies and this guy gives like no interviews uh um he's just this one guy and the reason he's on people's radar now is because he started making these wild public offers at these old school Furniture companies so he went to them privately he's like I'd like to buy your company and they're like you know they're in Nebraska they're 65 years old they're like you know my father's father built this table in this furniture store like what are you talking about and he here's this 32-year-old kid who lives in LA and they're like no we don't we don't want your kind here basically so they don't like his offer so he's like okay this is getting me nowhere so he just started releasing press releases saying I'd like to buy this company for 20 or 30% over the public you know share price right now please respond Bor uh you have not been productive you have not responded to my offer in private you have not told me a counter offer you've said neither yes nor no your shareholders deserve this um publicly so he's publicly making offers on these two public companies and that's how he's like now on people's radar because he was like pretty much doing this under the radar before this what do you think of this uh this guy and this idea that's genius uh I love it because there's just so much unlocked value in these businesses and he's focused on a specific vertical Furniture I have no idea why he's focused on that vertical but just that kind of focus will allow him to be able to um take the same product sell it across a lot of these different retailers get crazy improvements in margin by combining the scale of all of these and the idea of doing it going after publicly traded companies that are like undervalued so good and so he he said so they're doing they're doing over a little over a billion in Revenue now out of their thing and he said he's targeting Furniture because they're undervalued they lag um they're like kind of like uh they're sort of like lagging and they they who could benefit the most from like a digital glow up he's like it's these companies that are like basically not participating in the right way in like the digital world and the economy and e-commerce and and whatnot and so um he goes a lot of these School Furniture companies have a ton of customer data it's an old physical server in their warehouse software is 30 40 years old the company that made the software is out of business you can't even like get them to update it he goes um I'm just trying to get it to be modern we've built a platform and a process to unlock the value of this customer data I'm always a little a little uh skeptical of that type of claim but um he goes I have I have no desire to have my own brand um he goes constellation software has no brand they're just a $40 billion company that goes 33% a year 10 years ago the stock price is 100 now it's 2,000 they created a platform to buy these companies and unlock the value and tuck them in they had infrastructure people in process they created a machine to unlock value in this category I don't think anybody's done that in retail that's what we want to become wow uh first of all I just love the tone with which he speaks and like the humility and is just kind of like this is what we're doing it's simple there's no magic to it um it's obvious in fact why isn't somebody else doing this okay nobody else is we'll do it and that's kind of amazing so I bring this up for two reasons one on the tone uh he reminds me of you your LinkedIn is the same way where you'll be like I invested this company kind of got it was kind of like a Yelp for this is I don't know these guys can explain it better and like no no investor would write that on there or you you'd be like I kind of got acquired Aqua highish I don't know good outcome for the guys you know okay for me um you you're very honest with like your portfolio which I thought is good and and unique nobody writes on LinkedIn like that LinkedIn is basically like you know it's like those dog shows it's not like owning a dog it's like those dog shows if you watched a dog show you'd be like is this what owning a dog is like it'd be like no that's nothing like what owning a dog is like um so I I thought you like that you also when I started my Ecom Biz you sent me a on line email I don't know if you remember this you go you go with my last business we realized that we just have to do this one thing differently than everybody than like the current status quo and it would work we didn't need magic it didn't need like 10 genius things we just needed we just had this one fundamental thing what's the the one thing you're going to do that's going to make this work um and like you know that one question I was like spinning for like a week cuz I was like I don't know I don't have a good answer to this question does this mean my business is going to fail uh but this is a great question and I stashed it in my great questions list I thought okay I need to find that for this business but also for every business going forward what is the one thing that needs to be true or like you know is true about this uh do you remember sending me that no not at all but I think uh that sounds like the sort of thing I would do it for some reason it reminds me of um my first company I started uh I started with a A friend of mine from college um and we sold the company and after we sold the company we got into a fight and uh he sent me this email that was like 50 reasons this company succeeded despite your existence and I was like ouch and so I went and read it and uh you know he got to like 25 good reasons and then uh 26 he was like you get the gist and for a little while I read that email um like every day for like the first year that I got it and then after that I read it um like kind of once a year every year to just be like what is it that he said and what was the truth to it um I don't know why it reminds me of that but uh that was such a great um great know we great email there was some truth to it enough where I could kind of be like cool let me just take this feedback and action it in the future um and is also ironic in that um you know he uh he didn't he kind of gave up the startup game kind of shortly after that man you you really broke him as a partner well he actually tried to do a other startups and then I think um and I think got into YC and did a YC funded startup um but I think it's you know startup game is a hard game and so he was just like this this game isn't for me after some number of years um and the other thing that's crazy actually is uh so you know I started that company then I started tiny Co and we were raising our series a from Andre and Horwitz and he found out and um he sent them an email saying you shouldn't let this guy uh you shouldn't invest in this guy call me and so they called him and you know he was like basically read that list of 50 things and uh you know it almost killed the killed the deal because they were like yeah we're we're worried about investing in this deal because of this um and uh it's funny because there's so many things that um people uh there there's so many things that people will like admonish privately but uh but kind of celebrate publicly like Travis the Uber CEO when he heard that some comp some VC fund was investing in Lyft he stopped what he was doing he drove down to that VC firm and said here are all the reasons you shouldn't invest in lft right and that seems crazy uh but because he was successful brilliant and uh there were a couple other things with like Mark pinkis and Zinga where he did the same thing so um it was just a funny experience going through that with him and the kind ofre horwood series a and uh it's funny now because somehow uh 10 years later we're uh great friends again and uh you know he got married and I was like the best man at his wedding which is insane all right happy ending to this you um you also have been talking about this kind of like buy a public company thing so cuz I'm I'm like yo what's next for what do you what's the next big swing what are you excited to do and uh you've talked about this so let's let's go into some of those that idea because I don't think most people in the startup game think or talk about going and buying a public company or or you know sort of a hostile takeover what what have you uh what's the idea here and why might you do it um yeah so I've been kind of trying to figure out what to do next I think after tinyo I was like Wow startups are hard I'm going to try to take it easy and uh now gotten to a place where I'm like cool let's do something big again um and starting a new company from scratch is really hard so I've just been like is there a public company that I can acquire um where I don't go through that zero to one phase that everybody loves but is really difficult and go to a place where something's already at a five or 10 and uh can I then take that and scale it as an as a way of kind of running a business um so to me the perfect business out there to acquire is this company that was that's this is number one on my list is a company that was a$3 billion that's currently a$3 billion do company but in the private Market was $10 billion so it was worth $10 billion before and now as a public company it's worth $3 billion uh the company is Squarespace Squarespace ad I feel like every the only time I ever hear squ Squarespace is in their ads now yeah Squarespace spends uh so much money on these like podcast ads and uh you hear about them everywhere on podcasts or um places that you wouldn't really you don't see companies doing like direct response advertising like I never see them on Facebook but I always hear about them on podcast which I think super weird and so the stock is down you know 50% since the IPO they're at this like kind of 900 million Revenue run rate now uh it's a subscription business with more than four million subscribers um I'd love to buy it because I think it's a great company that's super undervalued uh it's not being run to maximize profits so it's being run in a way that um keeps it at break even so I think you could run it to maximize profits get rid of those podcast ads focus on Direct response uh Facebook ads to get new customers where's the F in their in their spending they do a ton of like uh de non-direct response ads that are like TV ads or podcast ads that I think are great to have this like halo effect around the brand but I don't think those are the optimal way to maximize return on ad spend right and so they do I think 300 or 400 million of marketing spend so that's one you could make that more efficient or cut that down where what is the the other is it like like you know like Elon buys Twitter he fires half the staff type of thing there's like a huge headcount or what else is like uh fat in their system yeah I think they've got a ton more people than they need and their headcount costs are like 225 million a year and their headquarters in is in New York City and I think you could just cut that team materially and um you know get rid of the the New York City headquarters cuz it's super expensive to be there yeah Sam was talking about I remember back in the day like uh one of the earliest podcast talking about Casper and he's like Casper you know how I knew Casper was going to fail they had like 150 employees in New York and it's like why are you why are you hiring all these people in New York you don't need these people should be sitting in like you know South Carolina Omaha and like you know these other places like why is your customer support you know somebody making you know all this money in in New York he's like that's the first thing you got to do is just get rid of New York and he was like so adamant about it that's was like his number one rant and this is at a time when Casper was still like seen as like kind of like one of the like Rising Stars like now I think Casper's kind of taken a beating in the in the market and all that stuff um I think might have gone private again um because it yeah Casper went private couldn't couldn't last publicly I guess but the I remember that was his like number one thing like I say no more I don't need to read the p&l uh I just saw how many employees work in New York I could tell you this business is Miss managed from day one there's this great Carl icon story where he buys a business uh that makes like um subway cars and uh they've got a huge team in New York and a team somewhere in in Middle America and he goes the team in New York and is like there's three floors of them in some fancy Midtown building and he's like so what do you guys do and uh you know they show him all these presentations for two days and he's like okay I saw the presentation so what do you guys do and they're like we just told you and so there he's like all right let me go visit the guy who runs the Middle America thing that actually makes the railroad cars and so he goes to visit them and he hangs out with the guy and the guy's super charming and at the end of the day he's like so uh you know there are these guys in New York what do they do for you uh do you need them and he's like no those guys don't do anything in fact I got four guys that are just there to manage those guys and all the questions that they bother us with firewall yeah if you get rid of those guys I uh think the business will continue to grow and uh we'll be fine and so the next day he goes back to New York and fires three floors of people it's like that seene an Entourage where Ari Gold just walks in with the paintball gun and just starts blasting everybody that's basically like the the New York uh the New York firing by Carl ion yeah he tells the story with such a smile and and um actually he tells it as like this was pretty early in my career uh so it took me like a couple months to do this if it was now I would buy the company and fire them like the next week and so how how does somebody actually do this how do you go buy A3 billion doll company because you're rich but you're not $3 billion doar to spend on a company Rich so how does somebody do this yeah um I think three billion the three billion doll thing is probably too much for my uh you know personal balance sheet but the way you would go about it is is just like the guy at CSC generation is doing which is um make a public offer it's the same way Elon mus did it uh you first make a private offer then you make a public offer you um make sure that all your financing is lined up when you do the public offer and you know the way that US Stock Market works and um shareholder rights laws work is uh board has to respond to that offer and they have to have a really good reason to not take it if it's if it's at a material premium to the current stock price um otherwise they're going to get sued out the Wazoo by shareholders right um and so yeah that's kind of how you do it okay so that's that's one way you um let's do some of the other things let's do so that's from big idea to fun smaller ideas so you uh you were telling me something like you helped your buddy I don't know High School friend or college friend or something like this sell their dental practice what uh tell us teach me about that I I don't know anything about that yeah uh this was a chance for me to be a deal Doula so this uh friend of mine called me and was like hey I got a quick question for you um somebody I I started this dental practice you know 10 years ago somebody um came in to make an offer should I take it and you know I thought it was going to be one phone call it ended up being like 60 hours of work with a bunch of phone calls with him and and the buyers of the business um and it was super cool to see the inside of a dental practice and how uh the p&l looks and how a company gets acquired like that so he has a dental practice that's massively profitable that he runs in a way where he's optimizing for his lifestyle so he does seven figures in iida has a 50% net margin all while working three days a week and uh I was just like oh my God three days what is he doing the other days he is making up new hobbies that uh he's getting excited about like uh he's never gone fishing before and he's like I got all this time to kill cuz I don't have bought all this gear now I have to learn this hobby yeah so he'll go find a new hobby and like buy the gear find somebody in town who uh is good at that and go with them so actually I hung out with him um recently and he's like let's go fishing I was like when did you take up fishing he's like I got so much time so he works three days a week and uh he's not optimizing the business for iida he has a big waiting list of patients who uh want to become patients but he doesn't have the time to see them he has one dentist that works for him and a bunch of dental hygienists but none of that is being done in a way where he's like optimizing for revenue or Profit just optimizing for his quality of life so this private Equity Firm um is doing a rollup of all of these dentists in that area and it's super interesting how the um private Equity so they've got a company that's going around and doing this rollup of of dental practices the company is um run has a CEO which is a dentist super nice guy uh super well known in the area and admired by admir and liked by all of the other dentists in the area so he's kind of like the figurehead of the company good cop good cop then uh they've got a COO who is this um hardened guy who's bought tons of businesses and worked for a bunch of private Equity firms and as an experienced acquirer and you don't even like talking to him after you know five minutes and he's the bad cop so good cop and bad cop go in and you know good cop does all the Charming saying this is going to be a great acquisition look at how it's turned out for me bad cop um does all of the numbers and negotiating so they bought this business and uh they bought it with a really simple premise they bought it for a 7x eida multiple and they're like we're going to go buy all the dentists in this area that we can and we'll sell it at a 15x eida multiple because we'll get to a scale of you know 2030 million in iida that's just the valuation Arbitrage right which is basically that small eida businesses like let's say you're doing a million or 2 million they'll sell for 7x but if you had 20 million of iida in a business it'll get acquired by a larger institution it's an easier buy button to buy 20 million a year of iida for 15x that's that's and so all you have to do is kind of like accumulate roll up and and put this together to get to that next stage of buyer yeah exactly right so that's one aspect and then the other aspect is they were like there's all these things that we can do to increase revenue for this guy's business one we're going to add another dentist eliminate the waiting list anyone wants to see a dentist they're going to be able to see a dentist within a week they added another dental hygienist chair so the dental hygienist chair cost like $10,000 and um my buddy uh just didn't go buy one and uh kind of put a dental hygienist there to increase dental hygiene Revenue um they even told him that uh there's all these things they can do to maximize to increase the amount of money they get from insurance companies so they were like there's this one instrument whenever you're doing a cleaning just pick this instrument up you don't even have to put it inside the mouth of the patient just pick it up for a second and then put it back down and then you can claim it this higher Insurance code and we're going to generate more Revenue so he called me and was like you know is this moral or is this immoral like can I go back to these guys and say hey I don't want to do this this doesn't seem right he said as he's holding the tool up for 45 minutes just to see what happens that's right uh and then because they bought all these other Dental practices in the area they're able to take one dental practice and say oh um you need braces or you need a root canal or you need whatever uh oral surgery procedure we're going to refer you out to somebody and so they used to he used to refer to people who are just kind of third parties and now you get to refer to people that are in the network already owned by the private Equity Firm nice yeah okay that's great so you see that machine and you're like wow this is amazing uh what's your kind of like big takeaway from that experience because I think most people wouldn't take the time to go do that uh you did and I think you probably got something out of it what what what was your big takeaways uh well I thought it was amazing that it was a win for the private Equity Firm and just being able to see the rollup strategy and and how good it was for them up front was awesome I also got to see it from his perspective and from his perspective it was also a huge win it was an easy transaction he didn't shop it around um it was a way for him to retire and become the richest person that he knows he owned the real estate of the dental practice so he got to keep the real estate and now the choir pays him rent every month for the real estate that he owns and uh now he gets to go because he was working three days a week which is a lot he now gets to uh take month-long vacations to Europe or Africa or wherever he wants to go for fun with his whole family yeah that's amazing I also like the I'm the richest guy know that I think that's a funny thing that actually does happen in a bunch of like especially smaller towns and uh like Niche things it's like if you can make $8 million or something like that you are you you know you're done like you don't need anymore and you you feel like there's a beauty in that like if you're in Silicon Valley you could build a billion dollar business and like you might not get invited to the big boy table still uh right because it's like everybody knows 50 people that are more successful younger smarter and uh you know more ambitious than them and so there's like this never ending you know like race that you're on if you're in Sil Valley New York LA and that's just not true in these other places and I think there's some there's something great about that yeah it's amazing the only way to win the rat race is to opt out of the Rat Race and uh he has opted out and uh has thereby won the rat race and it's so funny to compare my life to his cuz um I spent so much more time working and uh you know have made a bunch of money so that maybe I don't need to work as hard or at all uh and yet I continue to work and he's like I'm chilling and uh you've thought about that or no it's like just not your nature um I have one of my goals for 2023 is to like take it a lot easier workwise and spend a lot more time uh doing as many fun things as possible like I'm in LA right now they have this thing called the Porsche Driving Experience uh so you go and go with a bunch of friends uh they've got Porsches in a racetrack and you get in a Porsche and just drive it around the RAC as fast as you can without killing yourself you know when we got back from the weekend getaway that we did I gave a debrief and I talked about this one observation I had which was that at that thing there was PE we met people or we were hanging out with people that were of like four or five different life phases so there was like um you know uh you know Victor and Judy basically like you know 12-year-olds and their mindset was like yo wake up it's time to play like they literally woke us up with a boom Box by the window just playing like you know testo or something like that and they were like come on the pool's already warm and then we can go to the sauna then we can play golf then we can play whiff ball we can play this play that like they were just and like from the moment they woke up to the moment they went to sleep they were like let's play so that was like the you know 12-year-olds and then it was like the 20-year-olds we met that came over that night that were basically like building the nft projects or doing the like Tik Tock in the Tik Tock DDC brand that was just taken off and they were like I don't know how to describe it but they were kind of like in that hustle of like they kind kind of thought they had it all figured out but they don't but they don't realize that yet but that lets them do some cool [ __ ] cuz they don't know what they don't know yet so they were just like young stallions like just you know full of exuberance and didn't understand where the limitations were what the drawbacks were but that's okay they'll run head first into that wall when it comes but they're having a good time doing it and then there was like me Ben like we're like in our 30s and it's like you know the 30-year-olds are sort of like okay I'm I'm you know I still have enough energy to do things but I'm not dumb enough to just do them blindly I don't have that that that great ignorance yet I I really like kind of overanalyze things almost and so the whole time we were like trying to think through our next project trying to like sit down and map it out and pros and cons and all this stuff and um and then there was you guys who were in your 40s and you were like you like Ramone yeah yeah you're like oh Ramone's like throwing out his back playing pickle ball and like you know you guys were basically some combination of like let's have fun like let's go surfing let's play sports like yo seiz the day I don't know how much longer I'm going to be able to do all this stuff constantly like I'm doing it and you know like I guess like there was like an element of like you know yeah business stuff is cool but like life is a lot cooler than business um where the 30-year-olds and the 20-year-olds were like no winning and business is a lot cooler than life um and like I remember just continually trying to be like hey guys all right you guys want to just sit down and just whiteboard for a minute and it was like you know just sort of like I was feeling this urged to do that and I feel you guys were this urged to like the sun is out let's go outdoors and like but let's wear our sunscreen cuz like we don't want to die it's like this element of like I want to live and I don't want to die that's where you guys were at and then we hung out with like a 70-year-old guy and he was just sort of like you know I want some action I'm I'm bored I want some action and like you know um I want to contribute I want to give back and like that was like a big focus and like uh you know it's just fun to have like this energy around me so that was kind of one observation I had you know hey is that is that accurate as far as you read it or am I am I making stuff up here yeah it's super accurate uh Ramon and I were like it's Saturday night and we have a bunch of entrepreneurs who are just like trying to sell us on their business and just like get themselves excited and meet people on network and me and Ramone were like it's 9 o' I think it's time to go to bed and these guys are like no let's stay up till 2: a.m. let's talk about business ideas let's start a new business tomorrow oh my God this guy selling mini katanas on the internet through YouTube and Tik Tok wow uh so was a real funny thing and then you know you and Ben were like let's talk about new business ideas here's a new business idea what do you think what do you think what do you think oh what about this what about this and Ramon and I are like how about we jump in the pool like just take an ice bath yeah so it is funny to see these different seasons of life life and um yeah I'm trying to kind of adjust to this new season and uh for example now on Saturdays and Sundays I try not to touch my laptop at all and be outdoors and with friends as much as possible well that it's hard to make that shift in that season I mean even at the beginning of this podcast like I'm going to buy a public company and take it to the moon and then it's like actually I'm going to like enjoy life and like you know whatever you know do family things and things like that it's it's it's hard to even be congruent in a 1-hour podcast with like you know a a kind of like Direction um so you know I think that's that's I've observed that amongst many many people it's like very hard it's very hard to stay congruent uh I I noticed this about myself like I'll be like oh I love this content podcast thing this is great I think I could be the best at this and then and then I get all this positive feedback where it's happening and it's like growing and people like it and then I'm like yeah but should I start this business doing this to be thing and then it's like wait what happened to the whole like I want to do this content thing it's like ah I don't know like I just it's hard to be congruent and it's e very easy to get distracted and get off kind of like Mission when you're used to doing one thing and you know you can always go back to that well and do it and there's this new thing that you think might be the right thing for you but is different and maybe a little unfamiliar a little less familiar I met this guy who uh started a company called solo stove and sold it um and it then later went public uh named Spencer and um he was like I started this company I work really hard I sold it now I made meab bucks and uh I'm good I'm financially independent I um he doesn't invest in any startups he doesn't invest in any private Equity Funds or VC funds he's like when people are like do you want to invest in this that the other thing he's like no I'm good he takes all his money and puts it in the stock market in the Vanguard vo the Vanguard S&P 500 Index doesn't think about it at all and uh he says that everyone else who uh is like this is an entrepreneur starts a company makes it and then goes back and starts another company they're only starting another company because that's the only thing they know yeah and he's like they just keep building a new prison for themselves that's bigger and brighter but it's still a prison in and uh why would you do that and so I had this call with him and then for a week after that I was just like walking in circles uh like muttering to myself what am I doing with my life what what am I doing why am I starting new businesses what is all of this um so it's really interesting to see people on the other end of the spectrum I think I told you that once when we I remember at uh some Park in San Francisco and you were telling me about your new thing and it was working great and I was like I was like that's I was like that's great and I'm like uh I admire that you do this with such ease it's like watching Steph Curry shoot three-pointers like wow you just can start a business and it just works like this that that that what happened to all the hard gritty stuff that I feel all the time like you're just doing it that's amazing U but then I also told you I was like I feel like you're playing the same level of the video game again and like you know you kind of beat this level like shouldn't you just like go to the next level uh I don't know what that level even is I don't even know what that means maybe it's not even business business um but like you know I said that and I felt like a real dick afterwards I was like that was a stupid thing to say I remember like feeling like you know that I was I first felt really bad I was like that was just kind of like a a I don't know like that probably didn't feel good to to say that or to hear that and then I was like also like I was like well do I believe it and like you know would I want a friend to tell me that if they felt that about something I was doing and I was like yeah I think I would and I was like I think he doesn't take that stuff seriously so you know that's no problem um but you know like I've felt that and and I've I've Fel seen that now in many people the same like build a prison of your own making and like you said the only people who win are the ones who sort of opt out of the Rat Race and it's really jarring when you see that and you're like wait what you're leaving but you could do we're still here and they're like yeah we're still here and they're like yeah that's great um I'm going to go wander over here and I'm like oh my God you can leave this room like I didn't know that was possible it's like it is honestly very jarring when you meet the like one out of 100 people in Sil Valley who do that yeah it is uh stunning that people do that and um it's so interesting uh when you meet people who do that and like what they choose to do with their time like you were telling me about that brain tree guy who's like I'm trying to maximize my life I'm trying to reverse my biological age yeah yeah and so I change my diet I've got like a team of doctors uh nutritionists physical therapists trainers and I'm reversing my age um and that's what he's doing with his time and energy and money it's super interesting to hear when people yeah the thing I've seen now have this thought which is that um my life is actually limited by my imagination and um growing up I always assumed it was limited by you know money or resources and now I realize my life is just limited by my imagination and uh one of the things that made me do is I'm trying to hire a chief fund officer my definition of fun is often like let's work and let's grind it out and I'm trying to hire somebody who's the exact opposite of me to be like no that's lame uh here's like five more fun things you could be doing right now go do those instead and I will literally close my laptop and just go do one of those five things in response to that that's amazing you uh that thing you just said that my life is limited by my imagination I think that's probably like I don't know how many minutes into the podcast video but that's a that's like a Golden Nugget right there like that's something I'm going to think about a lot what uh say more about that like either how you thought of that or what's an example of that yeah um you know it's funny cuz I'm uh living with my brother right now and the two of us wake up and we're like it's Monday morning let's go let's grind it out let's go let's win the ball game and um yesterday we like played padal tennis for 4 hours until our limbs fell off and that was way more fun that whatever work we're going to do today okay um and so I just want somebody to uh like I don't spend enough I spend all this time being like actually what what's happened for me is as I've seen more businesses and gotten older and more experience I feel like this is a little bit of a hyperbole but I feel like Neo in The Matrix where you show me a business and I can like see through it and actually see the fundamentals of the business and have an opinion about whether it's a good business or not or I see opportunity where I'm like there's aund million business here and it's just a matter of like doing the work and executing it and it could be a real business um so I spend my so much of my brain power thinking about that stuff and very little of my brain power thinking about how to have fun and like other cool things that people do in life I spent a ton of time reading the Wall Street Journal and talking to entrepreneurs but very little time talking to uh Instagram influencers or just people who are like balling out and having a great life um and so I just want to spend more of my time and energy imagining fun things to do like I love magic I would love to have a magician show up randomly in my week um like while I'm at a restaurant a magician shows up and is like hey everybody I got a magic trick for you and then does a magic trick at the table I A friend of mine told me that him and a bunch of guy friends would go to Vegas every year and one year um this guy was in charge of planning it and he hired um like five little people in uh tuxedos to follow them around and then a bunch of um like the Brazilian Carnival dancers to follow them around the whole weekend and so everywhere they went everyone was like who are these guys they got into every Club they got free drinks they got to all these people coming up to them and uh they had a dope weekend as a result and you know lots of people just go to Vegas and Like go to the hotel and Gamble and these guys just through their imagination had a better way of doing it yeah amazing um all right this is this has been good uh where do people find you you're you started tweeting so so shout out your your handle and then we can wrap it up yeah uh my goal is to get to 100,000 Twitter followers by the end of the year so I'm going to be tweeting a bunch more um my Twitter handle is my full name uh s u l m n a l i yes all right great thanks for coming on man you bet thanks Sean [Music]

you got caught okay you got God and okay I think we should create a set of the Forbes 30 to 30. I think we need like the Madoff 1000 um we're all the grifters and con artists that are that are out there [Music] all right we don't normally let Ben have ideas but we let the man out of the cage he's got an idea in bed what you you texted us this morning you want to try something what do you want to try we're doing a new segment fellas we're just gonna we're going quick through the news and we're having you guys react people want to know what the fellas think about what's happening so we're gonna we're gonna find out or call it I'm gonna call this the boys react I've been trying to make this the boys thing a a thing for a little while now and it hasn't happened but as I taught my daughter yesterday we never give up and so the boys react is gonna be uh we're gonna react to the news here so Ben you have some news segments uh or new stories I guess and um Sam Sam actually likes the news Sam Sam's into the news dude I I read the news like crazy you don't read the news I'm an anti-newser I just love drama you know Preppers I'm like whatever that is where you avoid the news at all costs yeah I just like gossip I'm a big fan of drama my life's pretty boring so I I need I need drama I love the comment sections too somebody said this the other day I think it was like Nepal or one of these smart guys they go um the goal of the media is to make every problem your problem go that's pretty true that's kind of like what the news is it's like oh there's a flood in this County I don't live in [ __ ] let me watch this for 20 minutes why do I care about this this has nothing to do with me all right but anyways sorry let's start with the most interesting one Ben what is it we're starting a little close to home uh your friend Nikita beer uh his social app gas was acquired by Discord for an undisclosed amount what do you guys think about your buddy Nikita being acquired by Discord give the background Sean about this guy like because it's a pretty he it's a caper I call this a caper you know what that means no a caper it's like a uh a scheme but like uh it's like when you would rob a bank you know you'd be like what's that great Caper fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me he just fooled the tech industry twice dude he sold the same app so he built an app called TBH that was like uh you know let a teenager go on and it basically quiz you about people in your school your friends and be like who's the most cute boy in your life and you're like oh Sam it's like who's the most likely to be famous oh it's Ben right where you just do that right and then they would and just like it was eight years ago yeah download my app and of course that [ __ ] worked he did that and like it immediately went viral because it went viral Facebook buys the thing because Facebook has like a system internally that says like viral Team app and then it's like must acquire must acquire viral teenage app you know I get that young blood in here and so they acquired it people had said 100 million dollars I don't it's not 100 million dollars uh but but I think something more like 30 40 million bucks and um and this was in 2017 2017. he sells the app promptly the app gets shut down within like a year because there was never any retention in this app he then sits at Facebook for four years and vests out the entire every cent of his earn out which is just hilarious in its own right um and all he did was just tweet all day you know like you know he worked in the new products division and uh you know half released some apps I guess and then he he leaves you know what's it called recidivism Sam you're yeah you're a person guy he leaves the jail of Facebook and he does the same goddamn thing again he creates another teen app for compliments he tells us this in advance he goes yeah I'm gonna I'm just gonna make an app that makes like uh 10 million dollars in three months and we both kind of laughed it off and we're like is that even possible and then he pretty much did it I think gas app has made 7 million in gross sales in like three-ish months so you know pretty much called his shot which we do respect but also we have to clarify one thing Sam Ben said he's our friend is he still our friend after how insufferable he is in the group chat so he is insufferable but I kind of like it a little bit uh I think it's pretty hilarious I love a good troll I think that you're missing some of the data here so he sold the company to Discord there's no release on price or anything like that but uh some people can make guesses but basically between leaving or being at Facebook and Discord he creates this Mystique I call him the Jewish Great Gatsby he creates this kind of Mystique where he's got this really lovely home in La I he's single or at least he's not married and he like hosts really fun parties and then he posts on Twitter about like his opinion on going viral and all like Legends likes or quote Legends start following him and they like message him and they he's created this Aura of sophistication and of like he knows what he's doing with apps which is true it's all true he's very talented but it was pretty cool how it was like kind of systematic so he has the talent he has the skill but he great job of also flexing that he had the talent and he had the skill and people start flocking to him and when he starts launching this thing and here's the analogy he's like he's like the guy who Moved he moved to a new high school as a sophomore and then didn't try to make a single friend but he just went to lunch and he was just totally content sitting by himself he wasn't a loser he was almost too cool to have to try and because of that everyone's like who is this guy does he have a is his girlfriend in college oh my God and he would just be like you know texting his college girlfriend that you don't know if you know if they exist but he just built this Aura this Mystique around him by almost not trying whereas everybody else on Twitter is like hey follow me for more threads about how great I am right and he's he's trying to do the exact opposite where he's just like only [ __ ] posting and um you know just hinting and posting little screenshots that make you think he's up to something big at all times yeah you're like who's this kid coming up to school as a 16 year old in a motorcycle you know like this guy's got a neck tattoo like I can't confirm that he's a badass but like all all sides point to it that that was his thing and he never he didn't deny it he didn't confirm it so it could be true it could not be true but the fact is is that he created this app something happened to it like there's a crazy rumor with the app that it was used for child sex trafficking which wasn't true he changed the name of the app then he changed the name again a third time and it takes off and he sells it uh we're recording this on a Wednesday I believe it was announced yesterday this is a wonderful Caper not to say that Discord didn't get value I have no idea what the truth is uh the truth is probably like they're gonna make something cool of it who knows but he pulled it off he called the shot he pulled it off and he did it in such an obnoxious way and that's how I love him you know I love guys like that I love what he did and honestly I love the way he did it too but the problem is he's like a fart a fart is amazing when you're more than six feet away but you don't want to be too close to the fart like you know the fart's not funny when you're right up against it and so that's the problem with this is if we were too close to it we got we had to hear him and he loves smelling his own scent I love smelling his own fart too and so you know he will in our group chat just post every like Twitter mention where somebody's like oh my God Nikita has done it again Nikita is the best it's like bro I don't need your Twitter mentions posted here uh you know for me for me to see uh it is completely he's an insufferable fart but I do respect what he's pulled off yeah it's pretty funny so this is like an interesting thing I can't believe he pulled it off but he called his shot I respect that I think it's cool also he's done a thing like you know um Mr Beast does this thing where like if you go talk to a pretty serious business person they'll like reference Mr Beast like a Mr Beast ISM where they're like um well Mr B said uh yeah yeah Jimmy just says you know we just try to make great videos as if like nobody else tries to make great videos or he'll be like uh or he'll be like you know we just um we're willing to put more into our content trying to make the best content possible blah blah it's like and then if somebody goes and looks and they're like bro you you your your video is put your hand on this car and the last person to take their hand off you know the last person with their hand on the car keeps the car like this is not like you know you're not stupid Spielberg over here but didn't we talk about this where we're like look we're gonna do this thing and we're gonna send them a welcome letter and we're just gonna make it really delightful it's just gonna be a beautiful totally well done just beautifully done and if you do it like that people start to buy in they start to eat that little puppy chow and so similarly he um Mr Beast does this reality Distortion where he makes you believe that he is the deepest thinker he's creating the most epic beautiful well done content he is really thoughtful it's just so it's like you know watch me fart in people's ears it's true that people I'm on a fart kick today people um people do like it the content definitely works but it creates this almost this Mystique around it and I feel like Nikita did the same thing where he'll tweet out [ __ ] where he'll be like um just move the butthole a Little Closer let's read out like uh you know the you know um the underrated metric and social networking is density uh by far more important than spread and he's like you know like if you're still measuring K Factor you might as well still be using a Blackberry right and he was like no three that [ __ ] that makes you think like damn this this [ __ ] knows [ __ ] that I don't know about social networking I would be like there's only five people on Earth that can tell you about building social networks the problem is they're all unhirable because their name are names are Mark Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey and Nikita here so and and so by the way I I think there's levels to this there's levels so I think he does a great job of creating it's like bro you created a app that lets me say which which girl in my high school is the cutest and then it texts her somebody said you're cute right like yeah it there's Beauty in the Simplicity for sure but they almost make it sound more complicated and artistic than it really is and uh and trust me it's not we're not we're not like every other social app you see we're changing the world one popularity contest at a time we are we're democratizing popularity he went on um on like CNBC or one of these like reduced networks or whatever and they were like we have here the founder of the hit teen app The Sensational app yes Nikita what inspired you to do this and he's like you know we just believe that teens you know the world needed a little more positivity and that uh we wanted to create a safe space for whatever dude the only safe space he wanted was it was a vacation home in in time you want to do you know you you wanted to fly private hey boys that that is amazing yeah his next app is gonna be called plebe uh but in all seriousness he pulled it off I think it's cool uh yeah I make fun of him because uh because of how obnoxious he's been for four months on this group chat but uh but you know deep down uh he's my kind of people I respect uh I respect what he's done and I also respect the massive troll that he's played on everybody here so this is good speaking of trolls who didn't pull it off uh Ben we got to get to the next story before we get to the next story though we do have to remind everyone we have a gentleman's agreement here everyone follows it if you follow if you listen to us it doesn't matter what app you're listening to you have to go to our YouTube page and you click subscribe that's the gentleman's agreement I have my pen here am I going to need this for the gentleman's agreement do I need to sign something or what do I do you actually don't see all you have to do is go to our YouTube page and you click subscribe you don't even need a pen that's how easy it is we made this Gentleman's Agreement incredibly simple you go and you subscribe and then we work for you and we make this content for you and we reveal our life and dedicate Our Lives to you it's simple that's the gentleman's agreement I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better next topic from someone who pulled off the caper to someone who did not JPMorgan Chase bought College financial aid platform Frank for 175 million dollars it has now shut down the website and claims that they fabricated more than 4 million accounts on their first email to their customer list they got a 70 bounce back uh founder Charlie Javis I think it's pronounced denies that this is fraud and claims that JP Morgan is just inventing reasons to not pay her fellas boys who do you believe well JP Morgan this lady was on uh like that's easy uh this lady was a Forbes 30 under 30 and then just like a couple years later sells her app for nine nine figures 100 million plus and uh it's pretty hilarious they even found they tracked it down I believe where they talked to the developers it was a it was like a they hired one freelancer I think who they said hey can you like make some test data to put in here and he starts doing it and they're the the guy was like I think this is fraud I'm out so they found those emails and then they did it again with another contractor and who actually did do it and they convinced the contractor that it wasn't fraud and so they've kind of like honed in on this that it seems quite clear that it's fraud uh bold move very bold move very easy to catch though really stupid like this seems like really a foolish mistake yeah this is like um JP Morgan's got a little egg on their face for not noticing this because this is pretty easy to notice I mean the fact that they sent one email and 70 bounced back right like that that sounds uh like it wasn't this really sophisticated you know botnet that you know was simulating real users it was just a bunch of fake fake emails in a uh uh you know in a database so you know that sounds pretty easy and also it says Uh there's there's an email with her she's asking the professor who ended up doing this will the will the fake emails look real with an eye check or is it better to use unique ID right so like you know handed the cookie jar as we say around here that means you got caught okay you got got and okay I think we should create a set of the Forbes 30 under 30. I think we need like the Madoff 1000 um we're all the grifters and con artists that are that are out there um you know I I think that you know maybe the Caper Caper 20 or something like that we got to come up with something here and we need to just annually I think we should just do a show but we just rank the best cons of the year and uh and give them their due let them put that on their bio dude I'm down and what's crazy is this is so so when I sold the hustle we had I think 1.7 million subscribers we used this service HubSpot paid for it and it was a service I forget the name of it but I believe it did two things we uploaded our whole email list and then I think HubSpot uploaded some of their email I don't remember exactly how it worked I think they did it and it showed the crossover like how many we each shared in a huge amount of emails I imagine HubSpot has like hundreds of millions I have no idea a lot of emails and then I also think it checked for fraud and it was like a couple days to do this it was pretty simple um there's just a few other services where they make fake data and the reason they do this is if you have a sensitive thing like a bank startup you put a whole bunch of fake data in it and it like makes up people and you can test your data because you can't use like you know obviously real Social Security numbers when you're testing certain things and they would make up fake stuff just to test the software make sure it all works Sonic I think it's called tonic.ai it's the and then says the fake data company we talked about them on the Pod I love this idea I've been trying to invest yeah I forgot I need to invest in this yeah I think it's a cool thing and so also with gpt3 whatever it's called I was like thinking I'm like dude I should just I'm not gonna do this but maybe I I was like I should just make up fake fake reviews for all of my like products and you could just like make up fake reviews or you could like make up negative reviews for all your competitors products but uh and I was like are you looking for a nomination to the Madoff 1000 we'd be happy to have you but you do need to formally submit the application in yeah and we have to make everyone pay a a 500 application fee too if there's no con going on on our side what are we doing here yeah yeah yeah yeah well don't you want to win the award it's an award yeah you did a thing with milk Road where um we have this philosophy which is like we should be we should bank that in the future we're going to cut out all advertisers and be our own Advertiser I mean only promote our own product our own service in this newsletter um that's the only way to hold yourself like accountable to not just acquiring like shitty subscribers right and so we we had started this new growth Channel we're like oh let's try this thing out we heard there you know the rates are pretty good we tried it out uh we tried it for like a week and we're like oh the numbers look pretty good we're getting cheap signups they're opening the email that sounds great and I was like hey just you know just for just to double check here why don't you just email all those people that signed up and um just ask them like you know a simple question like you know hey like ask them a one-line question that would be quick video you're in for them to answer just be like hey I just wanted to know blah blah blah I'm the founder of this thing just wanted to know blank uh because they're opening the thing daily it looks like okay fantastic surely they would they would reply to an email from the owner of the thing they read every day right um and he was like dude guess how many I forgot how many there was like a couple thousand people on this thing he was like guess how many people replied I was like well you didn't say percentage so man this is a number of people who replied I was like I don't know like 400 500 and he was like two we got two replies turned off the channel oh my God I was like Wow and I know a bunch of other people that are still buying from this trap this like you know this uh this marketing player this traffic source and I'm like well they're they're just dumping money down the drain if they're doing that dude seeing uh Billy McFarlane and the thranos lady go to jail um like this woman potentially could go to jail it's pretty crazy that like what do they not think like just like eight months in advance it's like man this isn't like internet play games this is like go to prison games you're this is really screwing up a a hundred plus million dollar acquisition and 70 of the users were fake that is crazy you go to prison for that type of stuff that is wild and it's just crazy to think that no one's there and they're like uh Charlie um you know like are you do you like generic Oreos and bologna sandwiches if yes then this is great because that's what you're gonna be eating for like the next nine months in prison Oreos that's that's nice well not not when it's every day and watered down Kool-Aid but like it's just it's it's pretty wild that people don't think ahead but uh this is such an obvious scam also JP Morgan you guys suck man you guys gotta be on top of the ball like this is such a this seems pretty easy to to figure out yeah fair enough all right what's what's next all right um Bitcoin and ethereum are up 23 over the last week uh crypto's rallying uh one major cause is continued rise of inflation 6.5 annualized in December the question for you fellas is crypto back no you want to just end it there I don't know well I will give you that's a great answer Sam [Laughter] um I get to say like I told you so no I don't get to say I told you so yeah in fact I might maybe take the other the other L did I did I sell book road too early did I sell the bottom um no I I think that a lot of things are rallying right now why because people did I think it's just a simple answer people did an end-of-year sell-off in December for tax loss harvesting and a lot of people will re-enter and then that creates some upward momentum and when there's upward momentum that makes people think hey is it coming back is this the rally uh did we do we hit the bottom is it time to buy back in and so people are buying back in um I don't think it's because inflation in December because guess what we had inflation in October and November and September and August too like where where was you know if if inflation was driving crypto up it should have been up all year last year not uh not down and so I don't think that that narrative holds I think it's much more likely that the same way that tech stocks are having a little brief rally um it's uh it's kind of like New Year optimism uh people being done with their kind of like in crypto there's no wash sale rules so you could sell book the loss for tax purposes and buy back in one minute later uh if you wanted to and so I think people are just buying back in and I think there's a little bit of people chasing momentum that's my guess have you ever looked at the correlation between G-Wagon prices use Rolex market and Miami penthouses and how it relates to crypto did you see uh yeah Ben Google that did you see uh uh I'm just gonna start telling Ben just in Google random stuff that are ungoogleable uh did you see that there was a guy in like you know how we have this Facebook group for MFM that we don't really check often but there was a guy who was like posting in a bunch and he created this website where you can sell your nft at a loss for tax purposes it's kind of interesting it was a great idea honestly um what's it called I forgot I'm gonna forget the name uh Ben might actually know it um it was called they advertised in the milk road so I remember seeing it there and being like oh wow this is actually a great idea hold on chat what did you say it was like a really it was like a white guy with like blonde hair looks like unsellable what is it unsellable nfts yeah yeah that's it unsellable nfts and so basically um if you wanted to book a a loss on your nft they would basically let you instantly get liquid on it and get it right back I think is the is the idea um which is just a very useful simple tool so you know get on that guy for creating that that was a smart smart idea so is this the segment Dem boys Dem boys react is that it I think I think we're not from Dem boys yeah I think we're still the boys until until we get a little more street cred go to the YouTube comments and tell us is the boys gonna stick can I make it a thing because I sure sure would like that yeah just type it as a thing or not a thing in the comments I just wanna I'll do I'll read the poll and if it says not a thing I'll only continue for another three or four years if it says it's a thing I'm totally validated all right that's it [Music] foreign [Music]

so he's got uh is it the daily wire is that what it's called daily wire so this is like a subscription Media company that he created because they're just sort of like anti-mainstream media that became a big thing like fake news and F the mainstream media well why don't we create an alternative the daily wire and the daily wire does some insane numbers it's like only in year three or four or something like this very new and it does over 100 million a year in subscription Revenue yeah and have you heard of their their spin-off Jeremy's razors dude you've got to go to this [Music] foreign dude I've had a hell of a of a of a day I'm not gonna say who but check this out a friend wanted to come skateboarding with me so naturally he got a concussion so I took him to the hospital by the way did you even get like an hour of skateboarding in or was this like five I got an hour in I got an hour in uh yeah and then he was getting hyped up seeing me do stuff he fell hit his head take him to the hospital to get his concussion checked out turns out while we while we were there while they were getting the scan their appendix ruptured and they get rushed overnight or they get they have to stay there overnight get rushed to the a different hospital emergency appendix surgery so this head injury basically saved his life and they were like I don't know like this is just a gift from God but you definitely could have died from this did the appendix get damaged in the skateboard fall or no just separately happen to be the same time separate it's just a weird turn of events very separate so that's where I've been so I'm a little disheveled but I'm wearing my cool guy jacket now that's my new thing I'm gonna be the token cool guy you could be the nerd congrats no this is real leather bro this thing this ain't Tesla vegan leather but I'm in my cool guy outfit so I'm good to go yeah um cool is what I would describe that as so that's uh all right where where shall we start where do you want to start are we still is Sam still showing up to the BYOB empty-handed or is he bringing ideas to the table where are we at with this whole uh well Sam does research thing I know you started with a doctor's note there so is that your excuse for why you don't have any topics we I just went over a lot of my topics I was the one who did the topics um oh you want to talk about your new seed oil only diet isn't that what you told me that you're doing a seed oil only diet so like seed oils are all the rage right now is it just in my world we start talking about them and now I'm seeing everywhere people are so anti-seed oils my friend Dennis was like screw it I'm only eating seed oils from now on I looked yesterday at the bag of um I was like you know what I kind of want to have one of these little little bag of this little pretzel thing for a second I just let me just check the check the stats on this I was like ah it's not so bad not too many calories whatever and I looked at the the ingredients I saw canola oil on there or something like that you know sunflower oil whatever these things are and it was a Sam voice in my head that just told me these things kill you and so I decided I decided to put it down I drank a big tall glass of water instead so pretty pretty big net win there for me yeah I don't know why it's bad for you but someone on Twitter told me it was therefore it's true if it's if it's written down on Twitter or if it Rhymes or if it's like a cute phrase I automatically believe it alliterations Rhymes or four people I don't know either any one of those three and I'm in let me tell you uh two things one you said something about like oh it's beautiful it's well done and it reminded me I uh yesterday I found anime what would be an amazing DDC product not amazing like hundreds of millions of dollars but uh a DDC business that is I know would just it would work it would work really well it would be very profitable um I'm looking uh if somebody wants to operate it I I'll I will just simply give you an idea in a Playbook and then uh I'll take my share and we can we can start this company but basically it would require somebody who's good at things that are beautifully done so this I think requires the feminine touch so I'm sort of fishing in a dry Pond here with this with this podcast but uh to our four female listeners if any any of the four of you you've got a 25 chance each here to uh to step in and take it or um to one of our male uh listeners if you I don't know see a female today let her know about this opportunity I'm looking for somebody who could do something that is uh the product is beautifully done it would be a successful d2c product I have no doubt in my mind uh you just need to be good at a couple things you know an aesthetically beautiful brand and short form video content tick tocks or getting them made by other people if you don't do them yourself but easier all right you have been the palm of your hand tell me what it is um I can't tell you on air because I don't want everybody to copy it I will tell you off air wait really yes dude this was the lamest segment ever is that really it that's really what you want to do that's really what I'm going to do here if it happens then we can we can reveal it uh and if it doesn't happen then I'll also reveal because I have nothing to lose at that point so just not yet I I was gonna remind people this is usually a segment where I remind people of our Gentleman's Agreement where we work for you now but all you have to do is go to our YouTube channel And subscribe that's a gentleman's agreement it's called The Gentleman's Agreement because I can't check to see if it's true so it's just based on trust but all right I'm in The Penalty Box but I'm gonna fight my way out okay so here we go I tweeted something out the other day that I think is very interesting and reminds me of the Doug demuro a YouTube Creator yeah a YouTube Creator who's not just gonna make money off YouTube ad Revenue but has built a business that they built basically a 50 million dollar plus Empire off YouTube why did I ask this question well your boy's gonna start doing YouTube content but your boy also wants to make more than 50 million dollars doing this process and so I wanted to see who has done this before because I'm not really interested in being a Pioneer the Pioneers get slaughtered right so I don't want to be a Pioneer doing this I want to be sort of a fast follower so I was looking for examples and I got a bunch out of this tweet I want to read some of them off to you and see what you think about these first one by the way when you tweeted that I don't know if it's because I know you well or if everyone like could read through the lines here but it was very much like uh tell me what to do with my life yeah yeah yeah yeah like hey can you just um can you validate my parking pass here yeah I need some need something so first one's right up your alley more plates more dates more place more dates you probably know this story a little better than I do I didn't know he was doing this because I watched his videos he doesn't really pump product as much uh or at least in the clips that I've seen if you watch closely he does not not in an obnoxious way right so this guy Derek super likable guy uh puts out great content I'm not even really interested in like testosterone and like steroid usage and something else occasionally I am with certain athletes but usually not but I find myself just watching this guy's videos because I like this guy a lot um apparently he's got a brand or maybe two Brands one brand uh you know the name of it yeah one's called Merrick health and the other one is called gorilla what's real mind gorilla mind yeah so gorilla mind if you go to gorilla mine gorilla mind is getting I want to say almost two million uh between one and two million uh visits a month right so let's say a million visits a month I think it's pretty safe that this that this brand is doing about a million dollars a month in Revenue so 12 million a year in revenue on his uh supplements brand I think more I I would take the I would take the the more on that one yeah uh yeah that's a I would say a conservative estimate uh would I wouldn't be surprised if it was as high as four million a month um and supplements are an amazing Niche to be in right like everybody wants to be in the uh everybody wants to be in the supplements Niche so um so that's great just gave me by the way two pronunciations of Niche uh back to back just to appeal to both both sides of the aisle you totally redeemed yourself and then Merrick is this trt clinic so they basically do kind of like you know uh help men you know stay young so hormone replacement hair loss sexual Wellness all this stuff um this thing's got to be doing pretty well too and I think they also do the semi-glue tied stuff uh as well I don't did he start this or what because it has like 200 employees on LinkedIn is just a partner or he started it I think he's an equity owner I don't know if he's the guy but I think it's he's he's so popular that it appears as though he's a a main guy and he's definitely pulling his weight I know a lot of people he used Merrick health I don't know anyone who uses gorilla mine I think gorilla mine's a horrible name for a supplement company uh but I trust Derek I think The Branding on this is wrong but it's interesting and it's what's really interesting is like he sells creatine do anything about creatine it's awesome for one and number two it's basically like have you ever heard of creatine it's awesome I'm almost positive that creatine is like a commodity like it's almost like all the same uh and and he's selling it but he has an upset here he has a he marked it up because it's Derek um but yeah that's a good example of a Creator killing it and by the way these examples I specifically said I said you get kicked out of the party if you come here and you say Joe Rogan or Mr B started like it has to be somebody else like not the examples everybody always talks about so here's here's a couple others okay so here's some that uh I'll go in order of the ones you know to the ones I think you don't know so another one you know Kayla I don't know how you say her last name Kayla izinis I think so no I think it's like it's new or something I think it's pronounced a little bit different but but if you're if you're one of the four women listeners they 100 know who she is trying to pronounce like uh Hermes or something like that on this podcast or like Hermes yeah you know I got a lot of [ __ ] for that um yeah one time I heard you pronounce it you're not exactly good at pronouncing pronouncing things my mouth doesn't fully work yeah I got a thick tongue uh so she created this app so she's like a fitness influencer type person ends up creating an app called The Sweat app I believe they sold it for 400 million dollars so her and her husband or boyfriend and then they broke up but they kept building the business together I don't know what ended up happening there but it sounded like there was some drama uh 400 million dollars on this exit so I thought that was a great example of not just saying cool I'm gonna hold up a detox tea and you know get paid five thousand dollars for a shout out I'm actually going to create a business off of my following um Mark Rober so Mark Rober yeah he's a former NASA engineer he makes like engineering videos like oh I built the world's biggest T-shirt cannon I love this guy he built it yeah he's a really likable guy he's like you know the science teacher everyone's favorite science teacher type of guy he has a monthly subscription box I think that does like it's like a science kit and you're like you get to build little products yourself and that's a great idea super on brand uh it's 25 30 bucks um this thing is I I think doing millions of dollars um a year pretty safely he's got a very very big following 23 million I think on YouTube I mean he's like one of the big guys yeah he's been around for a long time um okay another one you probably know Ben Shapiro so Ben Shapiro is um by the way I'm gonna make a little prediction you don't agree with everything he says but you kind of love this guy yeah yeah I'm objecting I also feel the same way yeah I like his nerd Swagger and he's he's just fast-mouthed he just like says things very succinctly and quickly and I don't believe in most of the things he says I believe maybe some of them he's pretty religious uh and I'm not into I'm not into religion but he says a lot of stuff that I'm like dude just the fact that you came with that like pretty brutal reply so quickly I respect you yeah it's like a rap battle right like you just at the end of the day you know whoever kind of insults the other person the fastest and the best wins and uh he does not have a thick tongue like your boys uh do so he's at that thin time yeah he's good man so he's got uh is it the daily wire is that what it's called daily wire so this is like a subscription media company that he created because they're just sort of like anti-mainstream media that became a big thing like fake news and F the mainstream media well why don't we create an alternative the daily wire and the daily wire does some insane numbers it's like only in year three or four or something like this very new and it does over 100 million a year in subscription Revenue yeah and have you heard of their their spin-off Jeremy's razors no dude you've got to go to this so go to it's just Google like daily wire Razer company but so basically uh dollar share or Harry's razor was one of their spots so basically Ben Shapiro's conservative or he's right-wing whatever he's you call him and so naturally like the left hates him um and the right uh loves him because they feel like they're being canceled all the time and so Harry's Razors was one of their biggest or big advertisers and they bailed they you know said you know we're not going to associate with Ben you know you're screwed up and so the founder or one of the co-founders and CEO of the daily wire his name is Jeremy and so if you go to Jeremy's razors you'll see the website and they made this crazy video where they just said like it's actually pretty hilarious regardless if you agree with them or not but they created this video that's like a hype video and it was launched nine months ago and it has 22 million views and they're selling millions and millions of dollars they basically just took the Harry's razors like it's pretty much their site is identical to Harry's Razors but they just go taught Jeremy's razors and it's like and the picture is this guy who's he's like smoking a cigar it's basically a big middle finger to uh to Harry's Razors on the about page it says Harry's in the daily wire had a deal they paid us we advertised their razors but after we said that boys our boys and girls are girls they probably condemned our views as inexcusable uh and misaligned and you know what uh you're damn right our values are misaligned we value truth and the right to speak we Embrace masculinity and the courage to uphold it and so that's like the whole shtick it's Us Versus Them regardless of what you feel about that if you think it's right or wrong very uh they capitalized on something and it's and it's doing well this is so good this is uh wow this is an amazing amazing little case here the video that's the like ad the launch video for this it starts with a it's like it's like professionally made and basically starts with like you hear like a car and you're in a parking lot and it shows like the parking signs and it's like um you know the daily wire and then it says god king and a guy pulls up in a McLaren and he gets out with a like a blowtorch and he goes inside and just blow torches a bunch of like Harry's um like merchandise and just sets it on fire and it's like uh such a such a smart thing to do to take this like great business model right the the classic kind of Gillette you know um Razer cartridge model and then just be like no this is the one done by by us for us right like um yeah that is so smart and I feel like that just opens the door for them to do this in five other categories yeah it's a very very intriguing uh case study of what these guys are doing so yeah that's a good one can you write the word Jeremy on a stick of deodorant yes you can all right Greg can you write Jeremy on a tub of toothpaste great yep you sure can uh what else can I write the word Jeremy on that's not there's now a guy running around grocery stores being like we can write Jeremy on that we can write Jeremy on this oh my God guys the opportunity is massive yeah they're like hey Republicans like sunscreen let's do that white people get sunburned this is yeah totally work yeah interesting case study all right what else is there all right so then there's kind of like the Emma Chamberlain a lot of people talk about her coffee thing people know that um uh Pat McAfee killing it you know he kind of did he did a hundred a four-year 120 million dollar deal with FanDuel for his NFL show which is pretty insane um that's like a absolutely insane like brand deal to pull off okay then there's some others that I hadn't even heard of so he's also the host of like WWE do you know that he's like an announcer there he's kind of Crossing I went down a very deep McFly Rabbit Hole one night because I was like I think I love this guy he's amazing and I was like I'm doing this for the Pod This research and then three hours in I was like this isn't for the Pod this is for my soul I I just enjoyed this is watching this whole journey and I was also like I don't think there's even a story here for the podcast I just think I really like this content and I'm and I never talked about it I just did three hours one night and I just never brought it up there was one time where I thought about our setup and I'm like we should do it standing up because he stands up when he records and I love it he also wears a tank top which I know you love yeah so win-win um all right so here's some others that I didn't even know who these people are Danny Austin you ever heard that have you ever heard of this person no okay so she created a brand called Divi and it's basically scalp care for women so she basically took a problem in her life which was I think maybe like as she was aging or postpartum maybe she was struggling with hair loss which is actually pretty common for women to struggle with hair loss um like I know my wife like after we had every time like you you go kind of like after you have a baby uh like your body's just producing whatever different hormones and there's like they all like complain about like you know their hair thinning or hair loss it's a very common thing so anyways um she creates a brand she first was just talking about the struggle and then she stole the solution so her content was everyone's like oh my God Danny so vulnerable so authentic oh my God so like I'm so glad you're speaking up on these issues and like you're a beautiful queen you're so beautiful this is like don't worry about it and then she sold a solution which was like the scalp care thing and she did 20 million dollars in the first like 10 months or something that's crazy so it just like took off right away like a rocket um so I like that one there's another way do you ever watch dandruff videos on Tick Tock that's like my favorite type of content people just like flaking off dandruff you ever do that people like people like popping zits too dude because I got crazy dandruff if I like itch my head there's gonna be a snow day I'm always looking for like a good a good dandruff shampoo and I love watching dandruff videos on Tick Tock it's a huge Niche don't wear black around Sam yeah not good um so there's this woman named Mindy McKnight this is another cool example so she started a brand called cute girl hair where she was because she was just doing hairstyles YouTube yeah great name honestly amazing name uh yeah she was making YouTube content just doing hairstyles for her girls that's cool content oh here's how we do this hairstyle here's how we do this one um it's kind of like you know what your big sister should have taught you or something like that and uh I think her story is like she has five kids I might butcher the story because I just I don't remember this was like a couple weeks ago when I saw this but like I think she's got five kids or something like that and they all have different hairstyles or textures they may have adopted or something like that and so she's like her content is showing like this wide range of like hairstyles and how you can make them all look cute no matter what your hair is right that's great she does a launch with Walmart and it's the second biggest launch with Walmart she just they're doing nine figures in sale so over a hundred million in sales um and her YouTube channel has five and a half million uh Subs um her twin daughters have YouTube have a YouTube channel with seven million Subs right like this is just kind of insane how big that launch can be when it's like total alignment between Creator their personal story their content and then the product once they have the distribution and so that was pretty inspiring to me I really like that and now uh now I have a good excuse to spend all day just making fun content for free and being like don't worry one day this is all gonna become actual like this will this will be real work this is not just me getting to play around and like you know be on YouTube all day all right well what else is there I mean cute girl hero great name what else you got uh well okay I just gave you seven but like we can keep going if we if we like Oh I thought you had a few I there's one one guy that I find very fascinating that I saw someone mention on your thing Gooseman I didn't know who this was a lot of people mentioned him so Guzman he's I guess a fitness influencer he's got athlete or something like that alphaly yeah his I don't know if his knit I think his Niche is like Texans I think he's hispanic so I think he has like a huge Hispanic following but basically basically he's like a rip a rip guy but he like has like weaved in his family into his content so you like know about his life and he's like a family guy he launched something like a 50 000 square foot gym called Alpha land uh so probably not in your wheelhouse but it's called Alpha land and uh sister Branch for uh dudes yeah you go there to watch what's going on is that like a gymnastics like part of the stream we stretch and watch other men workout yeah it's called Alpha land it's like a 50 000 square foot gym I forget where it is San Antonio or Houston or Dallas or one of those folks one of those places where you'd expect an alpha land and uh and he also has a clothing line and I think he's killing it I think he's doing a he's big business right I like say you acted like you hadn't been there or don't have a membership but like um uh okay yeah so this is my these are my 50 million dollar creators and all these people I think have built off of their YouTube content uh United Empire that's easily worth 50 million or more uh you um you you made fun of me for not preparing and you prepared that list I think I knew more about all of them than you did yeah because you were you're like a real consumer of content um right like I'll be like oh they use this technology in this music video you're like yeah I love that music video and I'm like I haven't watched a music video and it literally it's been 17 years since I've watched a single music video I went to your house and you just had music videos on TV on Loop I love music videos I was like this is what you watch and you're like I just leave it on [Laughter] I ran out of questions because I was like wow this is just a different thing that just doesn't happen in my world no I watch music videos constantly so yeah that's one of the ways I know about stuff also my wife is a little bit younger so she just turned 30 so when we were dating you know only a couple years ago she was like in my 20s okay yeah well hey I said younger than me and she's got a younger sister so I'm kinda I'm I got my toe in the cool kids Market yeah you like you see people you leave the house you take supplements you watch music videos you watch movies you read biographies you do a lot of things that like you know I simply don't do I'm like a I'm just like a heat-seeking missile for like what's the interesting story and then my stories are typically like uh did you know that there's this and then for most normal people are like yeah I love that I love their Channel you're watching them October for years you're a potato what you see is what you get you can pull the skin back a little bit it gets something new I'm like you're an onion bro there's layers there's lots of layers it goes all the way to the core the layers don't stop yeah but french fries are made out of me and I think that that's kind of a win dude all right let me tell you something interesting and this is more so I want to put this on record that I brought this up about two years ago but have I remember when I told you about the company bring a trailer yeah yeah you said um you said you were talking about um car companies or auction companies or something like that and you were like dude there's this thing you've been told that this is like a long time ago before a long time ago you were like dude there's this thing called bring a trailer it's sick you can just buy a car on this auction thing I don't even know how it works exactly you're like it started by this guy Doug no you're confusing two things it was the guy from uh inbox or whatever right yeah yeah so it was started the main guy I forget his name Nathan I think the the non-main guy but also co-founder I think his name is Gentry Underwood and he started uh this company called mailbox which is like an email thing that sold for uh reportedly 100 million dollars to Dropbox like before it even launched because it built up such a huge waitlist and it sounded like a cool product I don't even think it got launched but anyway it's this website called bring a trailer and if you go to it it just looks like almost like a Blog it's a it's fairly unsophisticated honestly I think it's WordPress and what they do is there's this neat niche of car enthusiasts who like things from like the 70s to like early 90s which I don't like my jacket yeah yeah exactly like my jacket and it started out small but it sold recently and it was recently ish announced that they last year in the trailing 12 months sold something like 1.2 billion dollars worth of cars in one year and they made something like 100 million dollars in net revenue with like 80 employees and you go to their website and it's so basic and people love it and there's this guy named Doug demuro who has a YouTube channel where he reviews all types of cars and he does it just within like an iPhone and he like always has like have you know like a bacon collar have you heard of a bacon collar it's like where you wear an undershirt on your on your shirt in your white shirt the collar is all like shuffled or like the the the white sleeves are like coming down below your Polo you know what I'm talking about okay so your undershirt is showing is that the idea yeah where you're like under like he's like it's like where you're wearing like imagine a guy wearing cargo shorts and like an Old Navy T-shirt with like a Hollister Polo above it and like you have a bacon collar like he just looks totally disheveled it's incredibly unprofessional looking okay I got the definition shirts that have a wavy neck due to being stretched out or from improper care yeah it's just like it's just like the very typical like oh my shirts look yeah you're a bacon color guy so that's what this guy is Doug's a a bacon collar guy but he's hilarious and he's lovable and he's likable and he's built this YouTube channel like he'll review like a two million dollar Ferrari as well as like a thirty thousand dollar Honda Pilot and it's right pretty hilarious he's got three or four million subscribers on YouTube now I told you about two years ago maybe I forget what maybe three years ago he launched this new company called cars and bids and it's very similar to bring a trailer and so I predict that this is actually going to be a multi 100 million dollar exit and I want to make my prediction there now that that's going to happen but what's really interesting here is curated auctions I think that's very fascinating because the reason it's fascinating is if you go to eBay have you been to eBay in the last like five years I have not dude no like not a lot of people do of course A lot of people do but like not a lot of people do and it's because it's one of those things no one goes there anymore perfect description it's got like 100 million visitors you don't know any of them yeah it's too crowded no one goes here anymore um and so it's one of those things where like you go to eBay and you like that one it was really the timing that I enjoyed it you go to eBay and you get overwhelmed with options and there's a couple of businesses that I've been looking at where I'm trying to think of what a curated auction could be because I think it's like I think it's cool and it feels it's just a beautiful experience you know that's what we that's our phrase it's just like one option but it's just beautifully done yeah it's beautifully done really well done anytime people can say like hand crafted or like Ultra Premium uh that's what this is and I really have been digging this I invested in a company that is doing this for homes because I've been looking at like what are big ticket items that people will buy online that they previously didn't but they will because it's more well curated so like for example we talked about uh I can never say it right but hodinki we had Kevin Rose the founder they sell like you can buy like a forty thousand dollar watch online and they do a really good job of editorializing it so I've been thinking what are other categories where someone can buy something online that's 30 to 100 000 even a million dollars plus but if you curate it nicely and you describe it nicely with beautiful photos so in the same way that Airbnb I don't know if you know this but they used to send out photographers to the really nice listings because they're like we charge a thousand dollars a night with better pictures you can charge fifteen hundred dollars a night so it's worth worth it to us to help you make your [ __ ] look better what else is like that that these curated auctions can can work out because I think they're really really cool companies to to run and they're really hard to break once they work once they work it's like the people working there you guys are important but like the community has taken you are you are just a um uh you you're just there to to help the community it's no longer your business that you're pushing down people's throats golf equipment golf equipment golf equipment really how much is an expensive how much why do you say that well you have an Enthusiast Market you have a kind of like a knowledge gap of uh which one should I get what's better what's worse blah blah blah you have a super premium price point and I think a golfer over the course of their lifetime is going to spend you know probably upwards of ten thousand dollars on equipment and I think that so because I think because I think the the thing you want is like cars you want a high ticket right you need you need a high ticket you need ability to drive high ticket customers to something and so I think that's one where people will nerd out on the content and um and get there but I have other this what you said by the way is a perfect lead into two things I want to talk about wait let me say mine livestock livestock like animals hell yeah dog dude my my so listen to this my cousins they're they're cowboys so they Buck Bowl it's called if you ask them what they do they'll go I Buck balls which means they live in rural Oklahoma and and when I went to their house once and instead of like it was a Thursday night and instead of going like the community softball game we went to the community rodeo and there was only like 20 people in the stands but they are practicing their Rodeo which is basically you get on a bowl and bowls are mean bulls want to kill you even if they even if you raised them they're just like mean and they get on these bowls and they Buck them off and the bull the person who stays on the longest gets a prize but the bull who bucks the hardest based off of like judging wins a prize and some of these balls cost 50 Grand my parents bought into a bowl for fifty thousand dollars and they get a portion of the like The Offspring like the the the sperm that they they sell and they get a portion of the winnings from the bowl they make money off of it yeah and they it's like what kind of money are we talking here what did it do the return's not like that great but like you like I don't know you get a couple grand every once in a while so it's like not that great and like the bowl can like break its leg and you're screwed but but should we go have these on a bull it is pretty interesting to own a bowl but it's a it's a huge sport in certain parts of the country my cousin went to college on a scholarship for bucking bulls for being a rodeo guy and so and all these folks they they it's cash so they'll come to the rodeo with like 10 30 40 grand in cash and they're like playing right there on it it's very fascinating you've never been to a Livestock Auction sure haven't uh dude it's dope but it's awesome I do think we should go have these on a bowl uh if there's a bull dealer in the audience uh hit us up we are uh we're in the market for one uh and we'll live stream our our bull purchase um yeah this is great okay uh okay so livestock that's one yeah sure I like that our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and it actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better all right I think I've kind of done this but I went even deeper down this Rabbit Hole so I got to bring him back as a new Billy of the week [Applause] [Music] a million dollars isn't cool you know it's cool a billion dollars [Music] the new Billy of the week is an old Billy of the week it's Sam Altman and you would think Sam what uh somebody you know you got nothing new to say here well Sam Altman we all know Sam Altman we've talked about Sam Altman dude Sam Altman's Sam Alvin's onion status he's got layers uh okay so I want to read you some of the interesting I went down to Sam outman Rabbit Hole last night here's why he did an interview and I was I was watching you got to explain who he is for the news okay for people who don't know Sam Altman is he's uh like an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley he created one company he didn't go that far called looped uh sold it for 40 billion bucks then he but he admit he went through y combinator the big accelerator down here when he was like 19. and the founder of why common are super impressed with him and kept him on his partner and eventually named him president of YC which is like one of like it's like being named the dean of Harvard after being a Harvard student because the dean thought you were so special and so that's literally what he did he became the president of YC grew YC he then created he then created the non-profit open AI he then left to go work on open AI open AI is now behind chat GPT which is like one of the fastest growing like Tech waves that's out there basically in artificial intelligence platform that's I think they launched Chad GPT and I think got 10 million users in like 10 days or something ridiculous like that it's worth 40 billion dollars companies worth you know somewhere between 20 40 billion dollars now and uh he's the you know the leader of that thing too plus he's a prolific investor was Investments all right so I got some of those facts coming but that's and most people know Sam Altman I'm not bringing up a surprise if you listen to you probably know who he is okay but here's some of the things I didn't know um I was listening to this interview and they go um you invested in this Fusion company and I'm thinking okay if you're gonna still don't know what the hell that is but I know smart people talk about it okay great and they go uh you led the investment okay that's fine he led the investment so you put you wrote a 375 million dollar check into helian uh and I was like what you know like rewind what what did this person just say and I literally went back and I re-listened to it and I was and I was like oh I didn't know Sam Altman has like a giant Venture fund like uh surely he's not writing a 375 million dollar check himself as far as I could tell that is what he did he wrote a 360. check himself and that got me down this Rabbit Hole up where did how did Sam Altman get so wealthy uh because I've heard several stories now so for example when he started open AI or even when he was president of YC he donated 10 million dollars to um a science research uh like um a project that he created right like science research nonprofit to donate 10 million dollars means you got a lot more than 10 million dollars and at that time I was like how did he get 10 million dollars because again his first startup which he was like whatever 18 or 19. sold for 41 million dollars out of that he said that he got five million dollars so somehow he parlayed five million dollars and in a very short amount of time about four or five years was now donating 10 million dollars that was the first thing wow it was that short that didn't make sense and I was like okay so he's you know this is now you know maybe six years Max later okay then what else did he do he also um donated to you know when he started open AI but they didn't say how much and then this 375 million dollar check so I started going back and trying to figure out what's going on so starts looped sells it and that's about five million dollars from there how old was he uh at that five million dollars like 22 23 yeah something like that I don't have the exact timeline but I think he's in his young early 20s is pretty safe to say there um he then uh starts investing in startups and so he's investing in startups second investment is drumroll please the best investment of the decade stripe so he's one of the First Investors in stripe um that was his second investment and there's this like thing that I've noticed which is uh in d2c Brands they call your first kind of like couple months um your golden cohort it's like I noticed this about our customers and my Ecom brand but I noticed this across many Brands uh which is your first that first batch of customers you get for some reason their LTV is way higher and it kind of makes sense because it's actually like the people who immediately get it with your message are willing to adopt your thing before you're a big brand they probably really have the problem or they're heavy enthusiasts um there's some there's an equivalent thing in investing for some reason it's very common for People's First sort of five to ten Investments to do extremely well uh in the world of Angel Investing when you're for for great investors often their best hits come early like uh Chris Saka who's one of the best early stage investors of all time his or one of some of his earliest Investments were basically you know the combination of Twitter Uber Instagram you know things like that and they came in kind of the first 10 15 deals that he did and I feel like that's the only stuff he did like those were the hits and then everything he did so well he retired right he became a billionaire and essentially retired from the game because he was like well my first fund was like whatever 6000 x I'm good um Sam said that in his first 40 deals um at that at that time he had invested in 40 deals um he was two years in and he said that uh five of the companies were doing really good and then it was like what's really good mean it was over 100 x so what's up that's not really good that's ridiculously good so what's a what's a fifty thousand dollar how big of it maybe 25 000 what's 100 times uh 25 000 well you're violating the no public math rule but is that 2.5 or 25 million so 50 000 turns into 5 million for 100x wow okay and so you stack five of those that's pretty good right off that that was like okay where do you get all this money how was he doing all these deals was he just investing out of that 5 million and the reality was yes he was investing personally but um I texted a friend so I was like yo I'm looking up Sam open like did he write this check personally how did he get all this money and this is somebody else who's young smart and friends with Sam and that crew and he's like I think it was I think this check was personal this 375 million dollar check because I think so but it might have been an SPV and I was like um I was like dude I feel like there's like some underground uh you know like team Prodigy thing where like there is if you're if you turn 18 years old and you're like a Phenom Peter Thiel just gives you 100 million dollars and I was like I was laughing and I was like you know I think you're in that club too and he was just laughing he's like oh yeah Peter does actually back it so I go and I Google it sure enough Sam Alvin right after he saw his first thing races a 21 million dollar fund from Peter Thiel they're 100 is dude I know a few of these prodigies there is there is a club they exist so people talk about like uh like you know oh just like what do they say uh you know it's that boys club and I can't ever break into it unfortunately that's true it's real they exist you and I aren't in that club maybe we have our own club but these type of like Elite clubs they're real they're 100 real so somebody said something they were like you know Sam they're asking Paul Graham I think they're like What's what stood out to you about Sam because from the very beginning I've talked about this before from the very beginning I think 2007 2008 Paul Graham wrote a blog post about who are the five most impressive people he's met in Silicon Valley or who does he admirer look up to or whatever and it was like Steve Jobs Larry and Sergey from Google and Sam Altman and it was like what one of these does not belong one guy invented Apple another guy invented Google who's this kid I've never heard of and he was like um when I talked to Sam Altman I think oh this is what it would have been like to talk to Bill Gates when he was 20 years old and I was just like what an epic call for a guy who's now gone gone on to do some pretty amazing things there was a story I'd never heard though or two stories I thought were pretty remarkable um I think there was a situation where at his school when he was in high school there was a protest from like the Christian or Catholic you know some some protesters that were like you know uh protesting the I forgot exactly what it was he's from my hometown he probably went to he's from St Louis where I'm from and uh he he went to a Catholic school if I had to bet I think it was a um I don't remember exactly what the what the protest was but it was like uh you know uh here we go so basically um a Christian group boycotted an assembly about sexuality so they're gonna have an assembly about sexuality at his Prep School John Burroughs yeah John Burroughs in St Louis and so Sam Altman basically takes the mic announces that he's gay and then asks the school whether they want to be a repressive place or a place open to different ideas baller and and then baller right yeah and then the college counselor goes what Sam did changed the school it felt like somebody opened up a big box and then all the and then all kids of all kinds got to be let out into the world like you know it just kind of like it drew a line publicly that's a really good uh way to describe it by the way and that is that is just an amazing story I love that story um he also talked about like okay I want to read you some other amazing quotables because this guy's kind of remarkable and we just respect people who kind of like what you say let the freak flag fly that people who just like do life their way and their way happens to be different than like the craziest thing that he did was he did a speech about announcing something big and he wore two double popped collars that were pink and green I love that guy I thought I remember seeing that I like your old conference like a big deal a life highlight for most people um there's all these amazing anecdotes from these these articles that I was reading so one because um so they got uh so they got in uh him and his brothers he's got uh Brothers Jack and uh Max and so they uh one of them started this company called lattice and like you know he had some phrase about what lattice was doing and uh and so uh Sam invests in Asana the a different company and he writes this blog post about like you know just quickly you have the morning of kind of writes this um where's this blog post where he goes uh how did he goes he goes he goes um yeah I uh you know I invest in a sauna because I think it's great it's gonna make people more productive because they do a b and c and it turns out that a b and c were like the same marketing material that Jack his brother was using for lattice and so the article's talking about it's like Jack's like super pissed he's like dude you just invested in them for the exact you know that's our mission statement why are you saying they do it and Sam's like oh dude like I'm so I totally I must have just totally spaced like I must have heard you say that so many times over the years that like it just kind of became like a a set of words I know I totally didn't intend that edited edits it but Jack's mad calls the mom and it's like you know Sam did this and they're and Sam's like are you still mad at me or whatever and they're fighting and then they're like and then the end the story goes like uh like and then Jack looks over at a board game called Samurai that's on their bookshelf in their home and says you know Sam won every single game of Samurai when we were kids and always declared himself the samurai leader because he's he always has to win he's always in charge of everything this is oh and then says Samuel been shot back you want to play speed chess right now know I read this and I was like that's literally like if Chad I told chat GPT to like make up a story about like young Silicon Valley nerds who are compared of a competitive streak you know like oh yeah it's called Alpha land you gotta take this outside and play some speed chess instead of see who's the real man yeah that's Alpha land in Silicon Valley yeah so I thought that was hilarious there's another one that I thought was a kind of an amazing thing so did you know that at some point he basically sold what did he do he sold um yeah so the The Story Goes he decided to get rid of all his uh you know Comforts except for uh you know three or four things so he kept a four bedroom house in San Francisco he kept his cars because he loves cars it was like a mclareness he has two McLarens and something else he kept a property on Big Sur in case the the world ends and um and then he has a reserve of 10 million dollars and he's like the annual interest should cover my living expenses and I could just spend the rest of my money and the rest of my time trying to improve humanity and so he's like I just whittled it down to what are the things I really care about yeah what do I need the essentials in my McLarens my 10 million dollar you know whatever and it sounds a little like trite because it's like oh yeah dude like that's it but in reality like if you know people in Silicon Valley like there's a never-ending appetite for more more Fame More Money More Everything um and I actually think that somebody who can sort of figure out do just accruing these these money points doesn't do anything past a certain score so what am I going to do with this money in my time to like make sure I use my you know my time on this this little blueberry cold Earth to the best Advantage right so I I like that he had that another thing that he said about being a prepper that I think you'll like let me read this quote to you uh dude I think he like didn't he like wasn't he like saying you know in case there's like a pandemic or something like that I want a place to go to exactly exactly so um so somebody goes like he goes up to this is the story he goes with these guys at this uh conference or like whatever at this Meetup or whatever he's like so what do you guys do they're like oh we just kind of work and whatever like what do you do for fun he goes well I like racing cars I got five cars I have two McLarens an old Tesla uh I like to fly rented planes all around California oh and uh one weird one I like to prep for survival and they're like survival what he goes he goes yeah I have a lot of friends that are constantly getting drunk and telling us telling me about all the way that the world's all the ways that the world's gonna end and I read that this Dutch lab had modified the uh h5n1 bird food virus five years ago and it was super contagious by the way this is pre-pandemic right it's pre-covered so he goes I read about this lab that was modifying this thing making it really contagious and I realized that the chance of a lethal a lethal synthetic virus being released in the next 20 years was well non-zero and non-zero that's such a that whenever I hear that phrase that that's like oh you either are smart or you're trying to be smart either way you've got my attention dude I have another one that when I was reading this he kept saying orders of magnitude orders of magnitude I love that I just decided that that's going to be the name of my gang and so if you want to join my gang it's called orders of magnitude and we [ __ ] [ __ ] up at levels the next previous level dude I'm gonna have like the the sub committee on that we're gonna call it parabolic or something like that like I'm just going to come up with like crazy names like oh you guys want to join the exponentials or not exactly oh yeah it's the orders of magnitude that's the Crips and bloods we're gonna say exponentials um so then he also says this before opening he goes the other one is that that AI might you know get really powerful or be used to attack us and Nations will use it um and then people were getting he goes he goes you know I try not to think about it too much but I have guns gold potassium iodide antibiotics batteries water a gas mask from the Israeli Defense Force and a big patch of land and Big Sur that I can fly to if the world ever ends that's crazy what a baller there's also a story of him walking around with Brian chesky Brian chesky was about to uh pitch at YC and this is Brian chesky started Airbnb Airbnb it was just getting going and Brian was explaining the idea to Sam he goes yeah yeah that's cool I think it's great can I see your presentation he shows him the presentation he goes yeah I think we can make like 100 million dollars a year doing this he goes Brian do me a favor can you add a zero to every single number that you have up there I need to see a billion in Revenue not 100 million just change all your M's to B's yeah take all your n's to B's and uh that that's good that's actually going to be my new boy stuff as we say sam you just needed our phrase no small boys change all your M's to B's I used to work at this office and they took the exit sign so you know how there's exit signs and uh at offices like above the door they changed the exit sign to say uh they like molded it in such a way so it said IPO so the exit was an IPO so oh it's the IPO side the exit side uh and I always thought that was awesome and we need a new sign that says change it change the ends to B's and uh that's what he did with Brian chesky when he was Fire Marshall would like a word but yeah the only North Will Survive only nerds will get that joke so he had another um he had another um quote about that the m2b thing he goes he goes he goes look I listened to your whole presentation and uh you need to change that they're like are you sure and he goes look either you don't believe what you told me or I'm dumb and I didn't understand what you told me or I don't know math one of those three is is what's true here like either you're ashamed to say it you don't believe it or I'm dumb and I don't know Matt and I thought that's great that's a pretty baller way to say things um I want to read you some of the other uh little like you know isms um okay let me give you some more so uh here's some like quick chat advice so so I'm pretty into my meme of the year is that what I call the midwit meme uh you throw this up on YouTube so you can see it but it's basically like there's the dumb the ignorant kind of beginner on one side there's the Jedi Master on the other and every in between is the kind of sort of like stressor type A personality that's like over analyzing everything and my goal for the for the year slash life is to live life like either the dumb beginner or the Jedi Master it doesn't matter they think the same way um and so and and not be the stressor stressor achiever type A over analyzer type person and um and I'm just seeing that Meme everywhere when I meet people I just classify them instantaneously so are they being right now what do you think you've been historically um I started off for sure as the dumb the dumb troll like my first my sushi restaurant startup that that was the greatest thing in the world my next thing yes uh even just when I applied for my job and moved to Silicon Valley and got a job with a billionaire like I didn't know what the hell I was doing but I was so dumb that I like my Approach was correct I was like well I'll just I'll just reach out to the guy and I'll just send him a letter saying why why I'm the right guy for the job and then I'm Not Really Gonna apply for other jobs I'm just gonna prove to this guy this is I'm good at this job and I just that was my job search right like I didn't do any of the traditional things I just did seemed like the dumb thing to do but that would also be the Jedi move too in that case it's like uh you know find the thing you really want and Chase it with Reckless abandon don't like just put a resume on 500 desks and see who calls you for the job um so you know I'm still a mouth breather I think I'm still pretty far left on that on that I'm still pretty stupid yeah I do it from time to time I'll often do it with my econ Biz like um Suli is my like kind of like Mentor coach on that side and I feel like he's the Jedi guy I know he's the Jedi guy because he's like he said something about Frameworks he goes everyone in Silicon Valley talks about Frameworks I don't know what a framework is and um at first I used to think maybe I'm too dumb like should I learn this thing I don't understand what everyone's talking about and now I realize they're all dumb he's 100 right like uh I'd be like you know hey should we do influencer marketing for the brand blah blah blah he's like remember I told you Facebook ads just write the word Facebook ads on your computer and then every time you think about doing anything else besides Facebook ads look at that sticky note again that's hilarious and he'd be like um if you're gonna call me and talk to me about another idea you better have to be doing 500 000 a month and don't call me about another idea until Facebook ads has got you to 500 000 a month and it's like the Jedi Simplicity is something I like you know Revere now so he had a few um a few Jedi quotes in this imma read you he goes uh Founders will come to me and be like oh you know what what if um you know I'm worried about saying this to my investors because then they're going to think this that might affect our Series be raised he goes just tell them and then he goes uh people are worried about you know you don't know how your customers are going to feel about this just ask them um you're worried about competitors don't worry about them until they're beating you in the market um and he's like oh you want to do these five things you're trying to decide like just pick one and do it most people just simply do too many things do a few things relentlessly another one he goes you need to every every year you need to think about how you're going to add one zero to what you're doing but don't think Beyond one zero and I thought that's a good jediism it's like a way to think it is great without being kind of like just a delusional talker and like you know living in fantasy land um so you had a bunch of those as I was reading this uh that I thought was was pretty dope he's um he's great man he I always see pictures there's that famous conference in Idaho like the Sun Valley thing and you'll see pictures uh oh no the rich guy one the rich guy one it's like we're like it's almost like a Davos but or something like that but it's like all like the who's who I think it's mostly media though which includes everyone so like the Murdoch family and like the people who run CNN and and you see like you know uh there's pre ex-presidents there and then you see Sam Altman and he's wearing like cool running shoes with like cool sunglasses and like his hair is all disheveled he is uh he's very he's a very interesting character Sam offman's cool he's kind of been like uh a little bit under the radar while he's been building his company but he said something the other day uh someone was like we're really hyped about gpt4 can you tell us he goes all I can say is like people are setting themselves up for a lot of disappointment I don't think we're gonna live up to your expectations or something like that and I was like oh that that's a pretty cool response now now I'm interested yeah he goes with he goes with AI there's people who think um AIS changed the whole game and everything Google search is dead AI is going to change everything gpd4 is going to be like you know freaking uh sentient and whatever it's gonna be amazing he goes that's that's wrong and people who think oh chat GPT this thing's overrated it's a big nothing Burger it's uh you know look it makes this mistake it makes this mistake it can you could trick it into saying this stupid thing he goes they're also wrong they're also being dumb but in a different way uh you know they're being dumb because they're not realizing how fast this thing's gonna improve and the other guy's being dumb because they think it's already there but it's not there yet uh you know the truth is like somewhere in the middle and um I just thought that was like a you know a much better like reply um I also thought there was like a couple of kind of remarkable little things that I want to share as well things that I didn't know about Sam Alderman so that first fund that Peter Thiel gave him 21 million dollars for uh in I think three years or so um let's see three years or so he had the fun uh the four years the fund was up 10x already um so you know that's like what people want after like you know a 10-year period in in four years he had done that um the second thing was how did he do it he made like pretty ridiculous bets so he he was like all right if I want to if I want to help create like you know trillions of dollars of progress that's going to come from Science and Technology not just like the next random app and so he's like uh all right I gotta invest in more science technology so he goes for he goes to Cruz uh which was a self-driving car company that eventually got bought by GM for a billion dollars but at the time nobody was funding Crews nobody was funding self-driving cars um it just seemed too hard like Hardware seems like an obvious bet now looking back right I mean that team was like a plus completely non-obvious back then and they were struggling he puts three million dollars directly into that one company and the same thing with this 375 million dollar check that like the lady was like most people can't write that big of a check he goes especially not into an extremely risky thing like nuclear fusion and it's completely right like that's going to be like you know a zero or massive and he's writing massive checks into it and he did this several times he puts like millions of dollars into single bets that he like had conviction on he then reflected on he goes of all the biggest winners um uh he goes I looked at the five biggest winners that I have had in that early portfolio he goes four of the five nobody wanted to fund they were not oversubscribed people generally thought they were bad ideas in fact I almost got talked out of doing them because smart people were telling me why these are bad ideas only one optimizely was an idea everybody thought was a good idea that turned out to be a good idea it didn't even do that well I think well it did okay I think optimize it did go public I think in the end so you know it didn't make it but um maybe maybe I'm wrong about that but like I thought it got bought by pe but like it was it compared to the other oh no it says they have a thousand employees I'm wrong yeah it must have been a hit so so uh the other ones you know zenefits uh Cruz um you know things like that uh basically he was like stripe he's like at the top now Stripes everything but he's like at the time it was 18 year old kid saying we're gonna like work with banks and change the payments industry and they ever Do's like these guys don't know what they're getting into except for like you know a handful of people that believed in them same thing with Airbnb he was early investor in Airbnb that was not obvious so he kind of got really into this like non-obvious but correct mentality which is the the Peter Thiel like school of thought too like um he's like the Investments that didn't work out people also told me those were bad ideas so it's not that all bad ideas are good ideas it's that some bad ideas are actually great ideas and that that's where all the returns are and so you need to be willing to go where it's unpopular which is so easy to like talk about and it sounds like oh yeah just do not obvious things therefore any bad idea I see I should invest in I get so many bad ideas and I think I would say no these are actually all bad ideas that's such a challenging thing to figure out that's that requires so much talent or skill I don't know what it is but it's really really really impressive and really hard because looking back Airbnb that sounds that sounds incredibly obvious but uh it's just crazy that he was able to pull that off yeah it's insane so anyways that's a giant you know Sam Altman gasm but uh the guy's just really interesting he's one of the more interesting characters I think that exists in the tech world so uh so yeah I like some of those quotes I think this was a 10 out of 10 pod you know so here's how I know it's a good pod so it's a 12 30 in Texas where I'm recording this usually I go and take a nap till about two o'clock after we have a good pod um I I require I require sleep and rest and that's how I feel after this pod I'm like I need to take a nap and that's how I know it's good all right great glad to hear it um oh and by the way I'm gonna uh show my tax return on the YouTube channel go subscribe and then you'll see it go my first point on YouTube if you want to see it yeah and if you find the glitch uh you might be able to see his uh social security number it's somewhere in there [Music]

but I actually think there's an interesting business where you can look at anything that someone is having to spend a substantial sum today for something that's going to happen in 12 or 36 months and you help them uh guess the right prediction you can build an interesting business and I'm going to give you an example [Music] okay so let's do it what uh what topics you got today all right I've got one idea based on something you sent me oh wow we're rich yeah but you thanks Sam you're having one idea based on something I sent you something put in the work today look I'm in the final interview stage for my new researcher um but you told me last time you had a lot and uh just hear me out so you sent me this thing called exploding topics right yeah and you said their traffic's killing it and exploding topics don't explain what it is yeah it's basically like a if you go to the website you'll see a series of charts and the charts are basically saying hey this um this thing this trend is is growing in um in popularity I think it started by which keywords were growing in popularity because Brian Dean who owned backlinko a popular SEO blog got involved with it and then it kind of changed to what it is now okay yeah so I didn't know what the underlying what are they looking at to tell you what's trending or not but they'll be like um you know hey there's this thing called Power Dash It's a vacuum cleaner for pet owners it's grown three thousand percent right now right there but you know the volume of that of that search is 320. so not not huge regenerative agriculture right uh growing 658 with 12 000 searches and you can look at that you'd be like huh that's cool I'm interested in that topic maybe there's something I could do here so I think it's similar to what trends was which was I will tell you about things that are getting more popular before they're fully popular in order for you to take advantage of them with content business that sort of thing right that's the idea yes and the people wondering Trends so basically I used to own I sold it I used to own this thing called trends.co and it was a weekly email on an online community that people would pay 300 a year for and we got it I forget what it was when I sold it but I think it was at like six million a year but it very easily could have been like a million a month or so in Revenue but um basically we would send a weekly email and we had three or two researchers and they would comb the web and five interesting things and they would write interesting reports and they would also include one to two Graphics that showed like here's based off of Reddit searches or based off of Google searches or based off of like 20 different data points this topic is growing quickly anyway what uh exploding topics is doing there's another another company called meet glimpse so I think it's meet Glimpse dot Co or.com I don't know and this is just called Trends forecasting and these versions of it including my version they're what I would call prosumer so people who just want to spend 10 to 300 a month on it they're not that big of a deal but there's this whole other industry of people willing to spend 25 100 000 10 million a year all on Trends Trend forecasting and I think it's a very interesting business model and I think it's a very under developed industry and so the one that I brought up a whole bunch is called wgsn wgsn it's basically a monthly report that comes out and it helps people pick which colors are going to be popular what sounds trivial but that's a really big deal if you're Starbucks and you got to go and buy uh 10 million name tags or something like that and you want to make sure that you've got like a good color that is like hit or for example wgsn do you remember Sean how pineapple was popular they helped predict that pineapple the logo is going to be popular their next one I think is the Lemon I think they said lemon is gonna be popular maybe you told me that actually and so anyway that's what this does but I actually think there's an interesting business where you can look at anything that someone is having to spend a substantial sum today for something that's going to happen in 12 or 36 months and you help them uh guess the right prediction you can build an interesting business and I'm going to give you an example and uh let's just say that it's like HR or like work Styles so what do we think we're going to predict um the work the the this particular age group what are they gonna want for working from home in the next 36 months and if you're Google or someone that employs 10 000 of these workers you're like all right I kind of need an idea because we're going to be making X policy we want to know how they're going to react the way it could work and this is the way wgsn and this is the way Trends and a few other things work is you do a combination of surveys so you survey like you need a pool of like a thousand or ten thousand people you can survey and get Intel from and make predictions then you look at like different data so like you look at sentiment you look at uh like what people on Reddit on Tick Tock are saying just what trends are saying and you consolidate in that that into a fairly easy to understand 1 000 to 2000 word email that you send out monthly and then you have a consultant on staff who you can call on a regular basis and be like hey we're thinking about doing X based off your research is that a wise decision and then you have monthly calls as well as a community and a conference and I think you could wrap this up and do it in most any industry and have something that you could charge twenty to fifty thousand dollars a year for and this is something that uh what's his name what's the bald head guy who I like Scott Galloway he did this with uh he did a little bit like this with his company that he sold for 300 million dollars what was it called it was called uh L2 uh but anyway this is my model that I think not enough people know about and take advantage of that I think could be pretty big and uh I wish you had let me guess which bald guy you like that could have been back we could have gone on for a couple hours on that one I have so many that could have been the answer yeah Stone Cold Steve Austin yeah um what uh so what would you do so you what was your what was your idea here of like how you would create like a trend says prediction type business what I would do is I would I would package my product in the way that I explained but I think that most industries that you work in you can figure out some type of thing where you can look at your the buyers of your company and be like or look at any any different roles in your company and be like hey everyone um can I just talk to you and like figure out like what decisions are you making that's going to impact Us in like two years and what type of data do you wish that you had today that would make your decision easier and I'm sure this exists but one version of this I could think of that's pretty valuable would be if I could pull like hey I you know we got a we're able to survey every you know CIO in the fortune 500. and you know we surveyed 70 of the cios in the Fortune 500 here's what they're thinking in terms of their software budget for next year or here's what they're thinking in terms of you know whether they per you know we HR people at the at the you know top thousand companies here's what they're thinking in terms of remote pay or here's what they're thinking in terms of the XYZ and I think if it's sort of like what GLG is uh where exactly expert Network and people will pay people like you and me two thousand dollars for a one hour call because they're making investment decisions and they need to do research and they need actual industry input to say hey what's the deal with this I'm not an expert at this you are but I need to make a 10 million dollar bet and so as part of my research and diligence I'm going to pay you know you and 10 other people like you two thousand dollars an hour 20 grand no problem that's a that that helps me make the right directional bet here and so I think rather than GLG being a one-way thing um I think you could do it as a as a you know kind of like pulse survey to as long as you had the right key key audience that was bought in now how do you get them to actually answer this I think you could a just do it as part of a broader like media thing like if you already have an a newsletter for HR people or whatever you could do it like industry dive could do this um I also think you could pay them and so I think there's some some version of payment rewards that that could go with this because you're probably charging a lot of money thousands of dollars for these reports um but there is another business I want to tell you from a listener here what's it do called Eureka surveys so Google yes yeah the bootstrap company yeah so these guys if you go to Eureka surveys Utah right it just says get paid for taking surveys right make money online here's how you do it and it's like these are the small small time version of it so basically you go you download their app um let me pull it up did he say we could say their revenue he told me it but I don't remember they told me once I think we could we should just say it maybe generically but like you know seven figures in Revenue bootstrapped off this um off this product idea and you know kind of amazing uh kind of amazing that they are um doing so well and I I think that this is like a really great business he acquires I think in his case I think he's going for kind of younger audience sort of like you know gen Z Millennial college students maybe stay-at-home moms like you know more of the average average Joe type of consumer and able to survey them and they offer gift cards in return like the brands who want to run the surveys offer gift cards and it's a great way to um it's a great way to you know get insight you know quickly like for me if I have a brand right I have a brand I want to run a survey like this um that's pretty that's like pretty um time intensive for me to go do so I would need to go to a service like this if I want to get an answer well so that's my idea for for Trends forecasting I think this survey once interesting there's a lot of competition in that space but I still think it's interesting but that's like a simple this is like a fairly simple straightforward thing it's a lot of work but huge business I think um all right what do you got um Okay so I'm gonna tell you um a couple names I'm gonna throw a couple names out at you you just try to tell me the pattern Leonardo DiCaprio Kevin Durant Ellen DeGeneres Luka doncic George Clooney you might be thinking movies you know everything Sports and maybe celebrity investing where am I going with this no they all play Pickleball pickleball is this crazy crazy thing that is exploding it's not gonna be new to most people here but I'm just sort of late to the party I played for the first time the other day when we did our kind of weekend getaway for Founders things and we played it's a lot of fun and I was like I get it I totally get while you guys haven't it took you that long yeah I don't leave the house so it's not an in my house activity so therefore this is the first time I got exposed to it right like you know like I'm those people that that like you know came out they're like coveted what they don't know what's going on um that's what happened to me with pickleball and so I started looking into it and I think there's something I think there's a bunch of little interesting things I want to hear kind of what you you find interesting this but I'm gonna throw some stats at you so my My overall take is pickleball is exploding um here's some opportunities I see and I think it's gonna be huge it already is getting huge but I don't think uh but I see some potential traps and I'll tell you what those are okay so first of all just how many people in America this is a tough one yeah so many people in America played pickleball in the last year 20 uh no uh uh five million it's a good guess 36 million so 36 million is a crazy number right that's um twice as many people as go to like Disneyland every year it is that's the population of California right so 36 million is a kind of crazy number right that's like 14 of the of the total population and um and you can see this trend growing right so that it went from 5 to 36 that was in a one-year jump you can see on Google Trends it's just up into the right line um you have celebrities like I said earlier billionaires buying teams leagues that sort of thing um I personally know two people who have built multi-million dollar brands in this space I'm gonna tell you about them so one one guy I can't say his name but he built a Amazon FBA store and this was two or three years ago he sold it so he actually sold way too early at the time I met him I was like oh great you built a store doing what I've never even heard of this sport um and he was like yeah I just got into it um you know got really into it and so I just thought oh let me just see if there's much competition on Amazon for this there wasn't so I built a popular FBA store and sold it for about eight to ten million and so this guy sells it for eight to ten million dollars and I was like wow you know you know highway robbery um you know tell that guy to lose your number and now that he owns now that he spent eight million dollars on this you know pickle what you know what the hell is this I bet you if you had that thing now that'd be a 40 million dollar brand you know like this thing has exploded in popularity whoever bought it knew what they were doing um the second is there's a guy doing a newsletter called the dink so he's doing the hustle or milk Road for pickleball and we talked to him and we were like uh we talked about we were doing oh I see it the dink like d-i-n-k and uh cool guy he's doing a bunch of really smart things on the growth and kind of like content side and he was making more money per reader than we were making on milk Road we're in the crypto like Finance Niche and he was making more money per reader in pickleball than than we were because he was hey he's executing well um and Bae like turns out you there's like you know there's a lot of people who want to advertise and people who want to buy stuff and there weren't really very many mediums for them to meet each other and this newsletter was uh was that so this guy was yeah I think this news was probably worth three three million four million dollars today um so two people I personally know that have that have done this okay and I got a couple ideas here on I want to talk about why this works um where this is going and also just some of the interesting characters that are involved here uh you've played I assume you've played yeah but hold on before we I'm looking stuff up while you're talking I've got a few I told you so's that I want to bring up I was I was looking this up as you were talking episode number 147 this aired January 19th 2021 so almost exactly two years ago let's go to The Listener notes it says uh Sam brings up pickleball a booming sport at Austin it talks about all the opportunities there why he thinks it's gonna be big uh then you talked about dink I was like that sounds familiar so I wish I could can I share my screen right now I don't I won't share my screen actually uh I look up Dink founder it's a guy named Thomas Shields I Google Thomas Shields Twitter I go to his Twitter I click his DMS and there's an unread message that he sent me in September 18th 2020. hey Sam Thomas here nice to meet you um I uh Eddie sent me a video on YouTube where it's a custom video of him talking to the camera saying hey Sam and he's explaining to me about this newsletter that he wants to start and he wants to know if I want to participate in it or something like that this is the first time I've seen this video by the way I I've not even I'm watching it for the first time ever so I was I take full credit for telling you about pickleball I take not full credit but it is cool that this guy hollered at me and this is for three years later and he's absolutely doing what he said he was gonna do so man he's gonna respond to the personal video huh I well this is an unread Twitter message I never saw it but but anyway that so that's mine huh I yeah well I remember seeing it but Twitter's actually great because you can open up a message and they don't know and they don't know until you hit accept and you could read the whole message and some people like hey you never saw it I'm like yeah so anyway that's my story so you're asking me have I played picklebor pickleball before and my my responses to that is does that does Dolly Parton sleep on her back yes I've played pickle pickleball before dude of course I have have you seen me have you looked at me I'm a I'm a tall white guy from the Midwest of course I play Pickleball do I like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches sure do am I taking a swing of a of a of an old school Coca-Cola classic right now sure yeah yeah you ever had orange soda of course um do you know how pickleball started by the way uh old people uh it was like a senator or something right yeah dude you know your [ __ ] man this is crazy that's crazy you know that um it was a congressman so there was it was a board congressman who created this it was 1965. it was in the like the at the Pacific Northwest and they get back from some trip him and his buddy they have nothing to do they're at this house they have nothing to do they're bored the house has a badminton court great let's go play some badminton I guess they go down there there's no equipment for badminton they're like oh [ __ ] what are we gonna do so they're like well we got ping pong inside but we kind of be out I kind of want to be outside so they take the ping-pong paddles a wiffle ball and they go to the badminton court and they start inventing this game and they're just bored and they invent this game and they're like they call it pickleball because I guess there's this phrase called pickle boat which is like a hastily assembled crew for a boat and they're like oh it was a mashup of we just grabbed the paddles and played badminton and lowered the Nets like this mashup thing we'll call it pickleball and so they create this thing it's like you know just a small Regional game nobody's really playing it and somehow I couldn't figure out the link but like somehow about the last five years this thing has gone like very very mainstream to where now there are professional leagues there are um you know tons of celebrities own teams that their people are buying garyvee buying a team Kevin Durant's buying a team Tom Brady is buying a team Patrick Mahomes is buying a team these teams cost a million dollars now um there are billionaires that are trying to buy leagues and merging the leagues to try to make this like an official thing it has become kind of real and um there's people are trying to create like Topgolf for pickleball so there's a place called chicken and pickle uh and Camp pickle that's trying to like basically create venues where you can come drink eat and play Pickleball and so there's like this uh you know mini Gold Rush that's happening right now in the world in the world of pickleball and I started thinking okay where do I think this goes because I've seen this now a couple times I've seen this with MMA right going from Super Fringe to more mainstream Esports um and even some other things like the Drone Racing League you ever seen the Drone Racing League the deal quite yeah that one hasn't picked up like I thought it was going to but maybe it will same same um and so you see these happen and you sort of think okay what does it take to make these work and I'll give you I'll give you what I think pickleball has going for it and then I'll tell you what I think is going to be tough for it so here's what it has going by the way we had a writer at a freelancer at the hustle who quit for a year and she became uh she wanted to compete in pickleball and she did and she started traveling to competitions yeah like it's like an intense thing people love it what did you say to her when she told you what she was planning here uh what do you think I said so that's awesome it's awesome right now and then get out and that's awesome yeah but it is awesome text me a pic go after yourself [Laughter] awesome emotionally I feel a little wounded and I'm rooted to fail no but she did and she's doing good um okay so here's what I think it has gone for it so why like let's brainstorm we've done this with food remember you had your food thing that was I think like low-key genius and nobody really respects you for it except for me but like I'm not such a left-handed compliment look people don't get it I do but no one else does no one else does your parents don't understand but I'm okay with your lifestyle we've talked about it two or three times just to say the joke again to see if it hits yeah and it just doesn't seem to hit but like let's do it again what's your food thing and then let's let's do the equivalent for the sports world so for food I was like there's like a handful of categories that you need to check off in order to make your food go viral so it's either going to be like a side food where it becomes the main thing so it's like instead of like ice cream that has cookie donut it's like only cookie dough the other thing is it has to be a different uh color than normal so green ketchup or rainbow bagels or it has to be a different uh size so like a huge pizza or a really small thing or the last one was it has to be the combination of two things that are related but you wouldn't normally have done it like the crow nut right yes exactly again genius uh finally I thought it hopefully you get yourself this time um so I think there's sort of a similar thing when it comes to creating a hit game or a hit sport because when I played pickleball I was like okay that was fun and here's what was fun about it um there's zero learning curve like we literally nobody even really explained anything they would just like stand here and when the ball comes to you hit it and then they were like there's two rules don't go in the kitchen and like you know whatever you know here's how the scoring system works they told me that as we were playing um it was very intuitive it's like okay cool got this paddle similar enough to tennis similar enough to ping pong I I kind of already know how to move my body this way all right this will this will work uh so zero learning curve uh we were playing and the age range of the players that we were playing with or somebody had their son there uh you know who I think is like you know 11 or 12 but I think you could basically play this game from age eight to like 65. and so everybody my my mom's close to 70. she goes to her pickleball League twice a week okay we only pushing this to 80. uh you know I don't know how but this is super broad range and how many sports can you really say that for very very few Sports can be played by extremely young and extremely old people um you could just play it with two people so you don't need like five on five or like you know a full football team or basketball baseball team um it picked up during covid because it was kind of like an outdoors activity that anybody could do that was sort of socially distanced and so I think that was like a big factor in white group um and it's basically like a lightweight version of of tennis um or even maybe even a lightweight version of golf in the way that people use it because you could talk while you're doing it you're not like just huffing and puffing and running the whole time and lastly and most importantly you could play the game drunk and so this is like you know if I wanted to create the perfect game those would be my my criteria and then you know out would come would come pickleball so I think it's it is kind of a perfect game in that way so I think it has legs for that reason I think it's going to keep getting more and more popular the fact that the whole state of California worth of population plays this game has played this game in the last year is crazy um and you also see other things going for it like the founder of Lifetime Fitness you know like the gym chain got really into pickleball and then put 500 million dollars into building pickleball courts in all of his like locations because he's like I love pickleball people are gonna love this and so he deployed half a billion dollars into building infrastructure dude I love that and people are converting tennis courts all this stuff is crazy there's 35 000 courts in the United States now dude tennis sucks anyway only like a couple people know how to play it you know what I mean like my wife took lessons on how to play it and I would go and play with her and she would serve it at me and I would basically just try to hit it back and that was how he played it sucked it sucks weird form of abuse actually is what you just described yeah tennis is stupid so to anyone listening who wants to capitalize this We can brainstorm but I'm going to summarize this in two simple words okay Vince McMahon if you are in this business remember those words Vince McMahon who's Vince McMahon Vince McMahon is the owner and current or former CEO of the WWE The World Wrestling Entertainment I don't know what it is but it's it's uh any time that we grew up you know Stone Cold the rock this is WWE back then it was WWF dude when you think about it WWE is just a bunch of ripped dudes in their underwear having a soap opera in front of 50 000 people and then the rest of the people on TV it's all it is is a soap opera and there's a little bit of ripped dudes in underwear wrestling that's all it is and it's awesome you've got grown dudes who are like the most like homophobic guys ever and yet they're like sitting there watching two oily rip dudes just rolling around it's like you know they get past it all because all they care about is the story the drama this is all you need to do so if you're interested in this uh you just go and get a picture of Vince McMahon you put a picture of him on your wall and you say what would Vince do yeah what would Vince do ww uh VD what would Vince do that's all I'd care about if I was entering into this because that's exactly what happens with tennis I only cared about what's her name Serena in that last like tournament that she was in because it was her last one you know what I'm saying like I only care about this Naomi namasaka lady I only care what's her name what's her name Osaka I only care about her because like I hear that she's kind of like going a little like she's having some mental issues and I'm like oh okay now I'm kind of interested we got a train wreck yeah like I'm into it and like that's like when I get I get hooked on it or like you know some of these like sports that I don't think are mainstream I get it like Lance Armstrong guy gets cancer maybe he's on drugs killing these Europeans all right cool you got my attention like I need a story and that's what anyone who's interested in pickleball needs to understand this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better so I think as funny as what you just said is I think you're totally right I remember when we started working on um an Esports product right like that's what got bought by by twitch we're building basically an Esports company and I met with a venture capitalist this guy Zach we he goes love Esports um but Esports needs it's Dana White which is basically Dana White was the Vince McMahon of the UFC and he goes Dana White he's like there is no UFC without Dana White right because literally the company was going bankrupt uh so so you know I don't think literally there would have been a company without without Vance sorry without Dana and his at the Fertitta Brothers coming in and buying it and putting in they bought it for two million dollars and then they burned another 40 or 50 million trying to make it successful at a loss before it finally turned around and started to become a thing and so they put in years millions of dollars and expertise at promotion um and willing to just run through walls to make it happen going state by state to get this thing licensed so they could even host events and then hosting an events figuring out how we're gonna sell tickets and once they sell tickets how are we gonna get this thing on TV once it gets on TV how are we going to build these characters in the story lines oh we got to invest in all of these documentaries and dude reality TV shows and things like that before smartphones were even a thing Dana used to give his guys I remember you remember when the these they first came out there are these video cameras that looked almost like an iPhone looks now but it was like a flat flip cams he get he goes hey everyone we're having a meeting you uufc Fighters everything you do here's your flip cam record it post it on like I forget what was popular I think it was YouTube but where he was like one of the first guys to do that totally totally was the first one and he had to do it because he no mainstream channel would let him in he couldn't get a you know now they're on ESPN it took 20 years to get onto ESPN as a sport yeah that that's how crazy this was and so you need somebody like that which is basically just saying you need a world-class one in a billion entrepreneur you're gonna make this work and there are some interesting characters that are involved in this thing do you know who this guy is dundum if you hear about this guy the search dundum pickleball um there is this billionaire who is like really trying to make pickleball a thing like so this guy made his fortune doing subprime auto loans which like you didn't I didn't have to say that Tom yeah Tom dundum yeah yeah some prime mortgage loans uh like you don't even have to say he made his fortune if I just said yeah he worked on subprime auto loans you'd be like oh so he's filthy rich huh like you know like there's no you don't put those four words together without being a billionaire and so he's super rich he takes a bunch of big wild bets so he put I think like 70 million dollars into an NFL competitor um called the aaf that like basically folded before it even had its first game and he lost 70 million dollars trying to do that um now he's basically he owns pickleball.com he bought the major league um you know the biggest uh league for pickleball or like you know there's two competing leagues and he bought one of them and um this guy's like trying to make pickleball happen and he's dude he also owns the majority of Topgolf he owns majority of Topgolf yeah he he does a bunch of stuff like this so he is uh pretty fascinating guy there's a bunch of like really like interesting characters that have like kind of pushed this forward so he's one of the guys who've pushed us forward um there's another guy named Seymour Rifkin you ever heard of this guy no why would I have heard of him here are some things about Seymour Rifkin self-made millionaire by creating a marketing company all right check uh does Iron Man's check does ultra marathons check Taekwondo black belt check he has bicycled solo Coast to Coast Check he he created um the first rating system for pickleball check he did all of this after the age of 50. that's pretty baller that's a that's a pretty baller post 50 resume to have so so this guy kind of uh you know pushed pushed the the ball forward and kind of helped legitimize it make it make it more popular as well and then obviously there's all the players and the people who have been playing at the Grassroots as well so so I feel like with pickleball there's just like this tremendous Groundswell and here's a couple of my quick takes uh first of all R.I.P badminton I knew I knew for the first time I saw badminton which was a little bit of a big sport I could tell I saw it coming and I avoided it like the play and it just needed a little a little tweak a little tweak there for badminton and you know pretty sad for badminton it was like sitting there the whole time and missed this wave so uh you know that sucks um second could this happen again like I need to go start playing all old people Sports and just sniffing around like what's up with bocce ball how do you play this [ __ ] is this good is this the next thing like there might be another old person sport that could be translated down um third you may not know this but I was on the cusp of creating the next pickleball back when I was in uh Middle School me and my buddies created a game called golf you might be wondering what's going on and golf was basically the combination of golf and ping pong it was an extreme version of big Punk and shout out to my guy Steven who was there with me in the in our game room and we created Golf and I get I guarant this is the most fun game ever and we invented it we just didn't know how to commercialize at the time um incredible game my version of that my version of that was in eighth grade we came up with the game called nutball or you or it's bloody knuckles with other parts of your body oh no it's better it's called nutball you sit 20 feet apart and you sit on the ground with your legs yeah and the person has to throw a ball the first person that flinches loses to get in trouble yeah my the Sister Mary came up to me and said Sam no more nut ball so I I got banned which is the win of itself uh funny story uh so I left you know we did that weekend kind of retreat Founders thing which was like okay we're gonna brainstorm we're gonna really make plans we're gonna you know think about what's next we can give each other great business advice um I left early on the last day so I missed the last 24 hours and so I hit up Ben and I was like Ben how was the how was the last day would I miss anything good anything really you know do you have notes you can share with me and he goes now we basically just played pickleball for seven hours because uh suly really wanted to beat me in pickleball and um he couldn't but he wouldn't let me leave until he beat me but he just couldn't beat me and so we just played four and a half five hours straight and I just picked up Non-Stop and then after that we didn't talk and I think like that's the sign of a great game a game that could take over your life and make you a bit of a degenerate so I'm all in on pickleball dude they need a leader with a good name when I was in San Francisco I got into competitive Skee-Ball and the guy who ran it was called Joey the cat and he you remember Joey the cat he braided himself in San Francisco is Joey the cat the Skee-Ball guy and people would rent ski ball I remember him startups he was just like renting out skeeball machines to bars or to offices and started doing yeah yeah yeah yeah and he was making good money doing it right he was making great money he owned buildings in the mission yeah he owned like anywhere where he had like a little Warehouse with all the Skee-Ball machines and it was Joey the cat and all of his uh Skee-Ball machines had like a tiger stripe on it and uh oh yeah you gotta enjoy the cap machine that's great man you you this it was like yeah you guys you guys must be doing well you're having you have fun in your office oh cool like yeah oh you're into like local [ __ ] nice right right right oh you still yeah you're supporting this local guy show me the cat yeah wow you guys got it going on so this guy needs a the leader of uh of uh pickleball they need a cool name like Joey the cat [Laughter] tiger sound every time you say that all right um okay cool let's do one more topic okay I want to give you one more uh interesting person um that I think is worth talking about okay so have you ever heard of virtual gaming worlds no dude whenever we talk about this what's my answer well it's just kind of like a rhetorical question really so go play sports that's what I that's what I hate me um remember about metaverse quests no I'm not too busy having fun like I beat up the last guy who said those words to me so go Google Google this company you're going to be kind of interested in this so okay go to this website and I just want you to guess their revenue just say we'll play a game called guess the revenue uh well it's just like a little Squarespace Rinky Dink site looking I don't know 5 million uh close close three and a half billion a year oh great with 500 million of profit and they did this in 10 years so what they do is they're basically they're one of the only legal online casinos in the United States they own one of the largest poker sites in America called Global poker and basically it's casino games done via sweepstakes and trade promotions that's kind of like the legal Arbitrage here to make this work is that they do it as it's not gambling it's basically sweepstakes um and they have a patent on it so they have like very he has very little competition at the moment apparently um and I gotta give a shout out to the guys so there's a guy who sent me this message and a bunch of notes on this I'm gonna shout him out real quick um it's kind of uh he was like dude you gotta feature this guy he's basically a billionaire he pays it like you know basically he he just dividend it out you know in the latest like whatever year recorder and just bought a private jet off the off the dividend it's like uh so shout out to this guy Ansel who um who told me about them so crazy crazy business he's Ansel on Twitter um all right so here's what here's what's interesting so the guy who started it he's an ex-financial planner he basically was not a builder or a seller right like the typical startup archetype is like you're a great engineer or you're the great growth marketer and he was neither he was a solo founder he was a financial planner didn't know how to do marketing didn't know how to do coding he was basically just a badass and he recruited Mrs Lawrence yeah Lawrence exactly uh he paid a developer agency to handle the build out so didn't have a technical co-founder CTO just hired a Dev shop um you know it wasn't perfect like they basically the code was so buggy like the slot machines would accidentally just pay you out a bunch and this happened several times they had to like survive that um and this is built out in Perth Australia so this is like built in the middle of nowhere so kind of violates all the rules single founder didn't have the skill set wasn't in a big city where you know oh you got to move to Silicon Valley or New York or wherever to do this uh he came to Silicon Valley once couldn't raise any VC because they can't invest in uh gambling opportunities but the good news is this that means this guy didn't take on any invest take how much investment didn't didn't get diluted so he still owns 66 percent of this company that's doing 500 million a year in profit and um and just you know three and a half billion in revenue and so you know it's a you know basically started fully remote they got their first office eight years in uh you know eight years into the business it's pretty crazy dude it says he um wow this is amazing so he said they increased their profit and they made 454 million in profit and it paid dividends of 430 13 million dollars I actually have a question so does that mean that the company only needs uh 40 million dollars or whatever the yeah 40 million dollars in cash to operate either that or they have enough cash reserves already there to for whatever let's say their burn might be 100 they might have already a stockpile of cash reserves so they just divided out the excess that's wild man this is wild so it's all based around this workaround which is that the US law lets you do sweepstakes um and you so they offer sweeps coins that can be redeemed for cash and uh they have a trademark around our patent around sweepstakes trade promotions basically they worked with the US lawyers to build a system where um like customers can basically buy virtual gold coins use it to play the games they have no value outside of the game um but they when you buy the gold coins you get these sweep coins with it and uh and yeah basically like they found a like a it was a regulatory Insight not a product or marketing Insight that allowed this um to happen so and sweepstakes are regulated basically like state by state so in order for something to change every you know different states each individually would need to change something in order to make this happen um and uh yeah there's basically like you know brands that will use multinational company like there's like sweepstakes companies you can use to run sweepstakes across States because of the of the complication uh dude whenever whenever people tell me hey I have an idea should I hire a developer or should I hire one of these agencies to make an app 99 of the times I say no you're wasting your money you're never going to do anything with it and it's just going to go to waste right this is the guy this is the guy top Tower needs to jump on this guy as like a story of how these things work this is this is a really fascinating story yeah exactly and there's a video of him in 2012 he's pitching at the launch conference to Jason calacanus I don't know if it's this exact idea but basically you know similar similar sort of uh gambling idea and all the judges are basically like oh you know the opportunities outside of the US it's too hard in the U.S and uh you know didn't listen like knew his knew his [ __ ] understood that there's like a regulatory moat and a a patent moat that he could create that would allow him to do this and based basically create kind of like a small a not small sorry a large Cash Cow um that's essentially like on you know nobody's really competing with them on this which is kind of crazy it's surprising to me that a patent would be this this powerful at um stopping somebody from competing because in Tech patents usually do nothing um I don't care about patents at all yeah whenever they say someone has by the way what do you Conor McGregor nice I like that word you can bring that back yeah a little a little Brit yeah you got to call me mate I like that uh that's pretty good um they uh whenever I hear someone say they have a patent like in a pitch I'm like I I think that means nothing actually it's a red flag I'm usually like that means you think it's something and it is nothing which means you don't know anything yeah it's like asking me to sign an NDA to hear someone's pitch I'm like oh you yeah you're this is a joke we uh I remember one of our startups it was like um or like when we bought bibo back we got the patents with it and it was like oh this is a patent for um like the idea of like going on a social network and whiteboard like there's like a whiteboard feature where one user can draw anything on this virtual whiteboard blah blah I was like oh you invented that he said yeah and I was like cool but like I use that on Facebook he's like yeah because this means nothing this piece of paper means nothing and it does nothing and like you know impossible to really use this or enforce this or like you know just way too hard in the world of like internet Innovation to to make this work it's that was my that was my belief coming in so this is a bit of a frame breaker here for me on uh on like why this guy has no competition doing this and it might be some other reason there might be another reason which is it might be that this is actually Shady AF and like most entrepreneurs don't want to do it or you know there's too many lawsuits or whatever definitely that one by the way definitely I I think it's definitely that one without like knowing anything about this and just going strictly off uh like I guess with zero information other than I see this guy uh owns a bunch of Ferraris uh probably that one oh his Instagram is prolific and you speaking of uh of of names this guy's got a name Lawrence Escalante like tell you can't be Lawrence Escalante and not have a profile picture as he does where he's like this at a poker table and he's just looking over yeah he's them boys that's what is that's what is his Instagram bio needs to be just I'm them boy this guy's the this guy's the guy uh well congrats to him that's an interesting find he uh this is a crazy story so yeah shout out to Andrew that's uh he knew he's like dude I got something that's great for MFM and sure enough it was yeah it's juicy that's what that's called let's call it that's called a big juicy burger it's a good find by the way we forgot oh I totally forgot speaking of the thing legal agreements patents important important contracts there's one more look if you've made it this far normally we put this in the beginning this one's for the for the real ogs you're into this there's this thing called the MFM my first million gentleman's agreement and by the way Sean in our last video you called it a gentleman's agreement and then you actually said shoot we have four women listeners we have to call it a woman's agreement and did you see the our four women listeners actually comment in the YouTube channel and in fact many said act no you have more I'm number five but what they don't know is that actually there can only really ever be four for whatever reason it's just like a law of physics or something like that one in one out it's like a nightclub and so we really appreciate all of you all four of you are like near and dear to our hearts um we look forward to getting to know you personally because we can because it's four and so um and actually they don't even need to sign the gentleman's agreement there's two requirements here if you've made it this far in the video and also if you've ever listened to more than one video Sean and I dedicate like dozens of hours a week to making these videos so now you are in debt to us and all you have to do to repay your debt is click like if you don't matter if you're listening on Spotify or iTunes or I always call iTunes but you know what I mean it doesn't matter where you're listening to it you go to our uh our YouTube page type in my first million and then click subscribe and now we're even and we work for you it's called The Gentleman's Agreement because we're not there I can't see your computer so you just have to do it just don't lie so please go and do that and that's it yeah it's like um you know Biden was thinking about canceling student debt well we're going to cancel your debt you're going to cancel all your podcasts then if you just do this one thing like I mean I couldn't couldn't think of a better deal for you honestly so um honor the gentleman's agreement go to YouTube my first million click subscribe and uh turn the notifications on too why not dude by the way this part of the Pod has become a fan favorite yeah this is really good and I have to say I stole this from someone Jesse on fire I stole this from him he's another YouTuber but this has become a hit don't know why you're admitting that I would just steal everything and say that he stole it from you um and let the well he's uh he he's a UFC podcaster so maybe he can kick my ass and how does he travel I've never heard it uh he goes look the other day I went and I saw the dish at 7-Eleven it was for Alzheimer's or uh like muscle something Dystrophy and I left a quarter there and I didn't steal the other quarters I just left that one quarter there because that's called the gentleman's agreement and I had to stand by it and that's the same thing with this I edit the video I come up with the content I do all this work I do it for you what you're gonna do for me is you're gonna click subscribe that's that's our agreement this is how Society works and right now everyone's doing it and if you haven't done it you're you're being left out so please do that and that's his pitch it's pretty good it's good and it's tough to come up with it each time and I feel like in doing so we also earn our part of the gentleman's agreement I'm making it interesting right uh we gotta earn it uh um we should uh we should wrap it we're done [Music]

foreign [Music] welcome back greatest podcast in the world a decision to click play and now you're going to learn things you're going to laugh you might even get a little teary-eyed at the 42 minute Mark um that is true also that's your prediction by the way because we haven't got there yet yeah but that's like the whole part of the podcast is like predicting things but your sweatshirt looks great is that like that's kind of who you are you're that stupid dog who says is he stupid no is he a monk so my uh one of my business partner Joe he's got that framed in a background on his wall because this is who I am I am calm and there's fire you know what I'm out on by the way I am out on the graph that's like this is what you think progress looks like this is what progress actually looks like and it's like a squiggly line instead of the straight up and to the right line I'm out on that what does it look like on that what what's it look like no it's correct I'm just out on the graphic like we know we like if you don't know that by now like if you're if you're over the age of 25 you actually have to report that comment as spam when you see it on LinkedIn you can't like it you have to say flag this as redundant I learned this 15 years ago and it I got it the first time I saw it I got it never needed to see it again dude I haven't ran Facebook ads in a couple years but when I did what when I ran it I think that if just one person clicked flag as spam that had a meaningful difference on the ad is that still is that still the truth uh I don't know because that's hard to say it's hard it's like a black box now so it's really hard to know um but dude you gotta just fire up the old ad manager once in a while take it for a spin well what I used to do is any competitor I would always click flag of spam yeah I was gonna say there's only one reason you know that yeah I would do it I would do it constantly because when I was running the ads like I would have an ad set that got seen by like uh 10 million people and I would notice like if two people clicked flag that would actually make a meaningful difference in the CPM and click-through rate and so whenever I learned that I'm like oh every time I see someone I don't like flag flag it's honestly a miracle morning Brew succeeded given that you were doing this more credit to them actually I couldn't it counts just to flag them all right let's uh wait before we get in we do have to remind everyone about the gentleman's agreement so in fact what you were saying about reporting things and clicking buttons it just did remind me of the gentleman's agreement and what is the agreement the agreement is think of it as an agreement think of it as a firm handshake done digitally between uh two gentlemen and and one gentleman says I will provide and unlimited free-flowing all you can eat buffet of content for the low price of zero dollars as long as you go to YouTube you type in my first million and you click subscribe and I'm not just saying that so we get more subscribers I'm saying that so that you get more of the content that you need I'm just looking out for you and so that's just what one gentleman does for another we dedicate Our Lives to this podcast you spend 15 seconds to click subscribe it's like that's the gentleman's agreement we can't go to your computer and check that you're doing this so if you watch more than one episode you owe it to us and that's just the agreement yeah it's more like a Santa you know Naughty or Nice List thing you just need to do it just in case so please do that for us we work hard on this um semi-glue tied do you want to talk about this I've been wanting to talk about this I'll be fairly open about semi-glue tied I decided I will but I so you told me let's talk about semi-glue tied and I feel a little bit Vindicated because I've been telling you about this thing I I this happens a lot I want to say I want to say a couple months ago do you think it was a couple months ago let's just say a couple months ago it was a little longer than that it was more like Sam goes um dude I'm getting it in it's after the recording after the recording Sam usually unloads like one or two just Bombshells and he's like dude I'm getting an insane shape right now I'm taking these drugs and I was like what and he's like yeah I took this stuff it's dude it's amazing I don't want to eat any sugar hold on hold on we have to let me set a little bit of the stage here so I like testing new products and that oftentimes includes body stuff I'm just a fiend for testing stuff I love testing everything and I'm not opposed to injecting myself with stuff in order to test it just like I'm not opposed to buying a two thousand dollar thing to test it like I just I'm I love new technology there's clinical trials they go phase one phase two phase three phase Sam that's actually how drugs get to marketing they go straight to Sam's body I said earlier that podcast if I drive a place that has the world's best coffee I'm testing it if I see a thing that says zero symptoms miracle drug I'm testing it so okay so tell me uh so we'll explain what this is so there's a there is a set of drugs actually so I don't even really know the medical stuff here and I don't know how to pronounce anything so you correct me where I'm wrong but well first let's let's preface this like saying none this is 100 Bro Science and we're like Wikipedia article and like three podcasts deep at best so take everything what we're saying with a grain of salt yeah yeah don't do anything we say Okay continue on so basically the background of this is basically um there was this drug that was created to help with diabetes and the way this works is uh sugar Cravings basically come from like a blood sugar imbalance so like when you eat sweets or carbs or drink alcohol or something like that your body releases insulin and that like lowers your blood sugar to a lower level but like when your blood sugar goes up and down that makes you crave it more so if you've ever noticed that like you get off sugar or like a carb heavy stuff for 30 days or you're like by week two or three you're like great I don't actually crave it anymore but if you just taste it really you're like I need more I need more and so and so there's this uh series of drugs that have been created for um diabetes and you inject a very small amount of liquid like uh I could say with that it is but you wouldn't even know but uh like enough to cover a quarter like a very small amount and you do it once a week and they did this trial about I forget how many years ago but they tested it with like three or four thousand people and they gave people this drug and originally it was used for diabetes but then they tested it for weight loss and they gave people this drug and they noticed that when they injected it in their body just once a week over the course of around a year they lost roughly 15 of their body weight so what's that mean if you weighed 300 pounds and this was for like obese people if you weighed 300 pounds on day one by after one year you weighed uh what's that 45 you lost 45 pounds in one year and people were talking about this and they're like this is the craziest drug I've ever I've ever take because basically it it's an early drug so we're not sure entirely of the side effects so this is like the big the big downside but like for the most part the side effects were like my stomach hurt I had some diarrhea but then after like two weeks that [ __ ] went away um and so this drug what it does is when you eat bad food like a sugar or something like that or carb you can just eat a little bit of it and you feel full and you don't crave it anymore and it makes it really fascinating so ultimately what it does is it lowers your calorie intake from like you know eating 3000 calories a day is pretty easy for some people now it's like no I feel super full after 2000 I don't crave any more food right and this drug is being taken the the forms of this drug it comes as like ozampic or wegovi or there's like all these like kind of the the brand names of this same drug or it's class of drugs and it's being taken by tons of Hollywood celebrities um Tech kind of like tech people like Elon Musk yeah Elon Musk said he was taking it um who else there's a bunch of people that that have come kind of dude like basically what's going on with this drug is people were using it for diabetes and then a couple really famous people including Elon I think there's I think the Kardashians said they took it and once that happened then like the the rest of the Rich and Famous started taking it and so like the woman from the office the Indian lady uh Mindy or something yeah yeah there's a lot of people who think she's on it because she just lost a ton of weight and then the New York Times And The Wall Street Journal separately each wrote articles saying out in the Hamptons and out in LA and Hollywood everyone is on this drug and everyone automatically like it looks 20 pounds thinner than they did six months prior and it's been causing a shortage for the people who need it for diabet diabetes yeah oat milk is out and ozempic is in that's right so okay so this is this is what's going on so you told me about this a few months ago and like most things I'm just like I don't know what Sam's talking about sounds a little crazy I'm just gonna sit this one out and see what happens then I hear about it again then I heard about it through one of the brand names I didn't actually realize they were talking about the same thing you were talking about who was talking about it um dude I I can't tell you how many random places I have heard this and then I'm on Tick Tock and there's a tick tock doctor talking about it and I click the comments and literally the comments are all people with diabetes who are like this is why I can't get my drugs like what's going on so there's possibly there's a ton of people with diabetes that are like experiencing because there's a shortage of access to uh to these drugs right now so they're trying to um try to keep up so okay where do we want to go with this so there's a couple things so basically you were ahead of the curve you told me about a couple months before I started hearing about it it's still not fully out there I wanted to talk about it now because I think three to six months from now this is going to be like a household name a lot of people are going to know this because it's going to be on you know CNN Fox News Group we're going to talk about it more celebrities going to come out about it there's going to be controversies about it there's going to be all sorts of things and so we want to like call our shot and be like we talked about it early yeah we should have talked about it right when you said it and it was in June by the way I started uh learning about it in June yeah six months ago oh man so you you've been way ahead of the curve okay so so you tell me about this miracle joke now I'm like you know most people miracle drug you know I'm skeptical initially so can we talk about I guess like have you looked into the science and the side effects I asked a doctor friend and he goes yeah these drugs they're super effective and exactly they work uh there's no he's like I don't know of any uh kind of known downsides to taking them right now but also they're so new so like you know we'll see 10 years from now if you know everybody's small intestine is shriveled up into like a little p and they what happened so well that's that what do you know that's the downside which is it now this particular drug I don't actually think it's that new like these types of things have existed for I believe a couple decades um but they the it is like new like on a bigger scale um I read like there's like this original study that they tested this on two or three thousand people and they found that like the side effects are like for some people you um like you get muscle cramps or stomach cramps and like some things where you're just like uncomfortable for two or three weeks for me when I started uh toying around with it I got really cold I was like freezing all day and I wanted to like wear a coat and I thought that was just because I was just like nine percent body fat but I think it was partially the drug um there's another thing where like they there's a chance it causes thyroid cancer but like uh they didn't that doesn't seem like a statistically significant thing at least not to the point of like causing true concern I think the biggest concern is I don't know you don't know yet okay yeah and we're not that's not our especially so let's not uh talk too much about it let's talk about some of the I want to talk about the business side and then I want to talk about your other experiments that you've done oh wait hold on you know what's interesting though about this why this is going to be big I think dude I think I I think there's a world where this like cures obesity so there was one downside which is like the study that they everyone lost this weight on after they quit taking it the downside is if you were into obesity yeah no dude the downside was like people gained weight after they quit taking it like they gave back like two-thirds of the weight so like if you don't like actually use it to create habits and then you get off of it you're just gonna get fat again but um I think there's a world where it helps like get rid of obesity I also think there's a world I think there's a world where it could help cure alcoholism dude there's been people posting I like here the reason the way I found all the find all this stuff is I go to forums which we could talk about in a second but people are like I'm an alcoholic and I start taking this and I don't crave alcohol anymore like what's the name of a form like Reddit or you're talking about like deep Forum like bodybuilding.com or something yeah yeah so like it could be a body I will go to bodybuilding.com or there's a Reddit called semi-glue tied there's a Reddit called uh uh ozenpic and we go be there's subreddits for all of them how many people are part of the Reddit for semi-glue tied uh let's look right now so there are 14 000 not that many so that's pretty low so like but that's cool that's enough people that like it gets pretty interesting and then there's another one for like each brand name 19 000. so and then okay so here's some kind of crazy business stuff so to be I'm like wow there's a there's a miracle drug that helps you lose weight easily and almost guaranteed until people like tons of people and a bunch of celebrities are doing it this thing is going to fly so sure enough the you know Supply starts getting uh constrained because too many people are trying to get it um have you heard of some of these brands that try to get it to you and how create how much they're doing right now so they're talking about the norvo the the European company and then like the like just the maker of it so I was looking I was like how do I benefit from this financially I'm not taking this drug but how do I make some money that's that's a different drug and um so I looked into the you know the maker of it the stock and then I was like okay well um how do uh who how are people getting this today so first search if you search as epic is a company called calibrate and calibrate has some crazy stats so calibrate let me just send you uh let me go into calibrate.com yeah so calibrate basically you go to their landing page and it's like ozempic online weight loss prescription it's a safe doctor strive glp1 thing you know see if you're eligible and then basically you get it's like telemedicine you get a call you get a prescription you get to weight loss drug um they they are currently valued at about forty four hundred fifty million this company in less than 24 months um they've basically scaled to about a 50 million dollar run rate No Way really kind of crazy so June July 2020 it's a zero um July 2021 it's less than like you know it's you know it's tiny and then it's gone up I want to say what is this how did you see this um I can't really say but it's gone up you know 10x in a year um so that's kind of crazy and they pretty well do you know why we project by the end of this year they'll be at 60 million and by the end of next year they'll be at 140 million so semi-glutide it costs like 500 bucks a month and when you take it you're like this is dope I'm I don't want to quit taking this right hey turn off the heater I got yeah for a Zen pick well it's like uh you like what would you pay to like be ripped you know what I mean you'll pay a lot yeah yeah you know what I want turns out I won't do is inject myself with a you know kind of newish drug but you know I think I'm I'm in the minority here it looks like the majority of people are doing it so uh there's this company there's nexmed um obesity is a disease not a choice we will help correct your body chemistry with a with this drug um okay that's pretty pretty strong um pretty strong marketing Okay cool so that's uh that's the first part is people are going to Google search this thing like crazy if you go to Google Trends right now and you search for like a Zen pic or you search semi-glue tied you just see it's like basically going up up up up up and then the the Google Trends like you know they do this forecast where it's like a dotted line and the dotted line is going straight up to a hundred is it really yeah they're like this thing is Gonna Fly um and so like you know I I think there's there's gonna be a lot of people doing this I think that if you are creating content that is reviews reviews science uh like some summarizing the science around this stuff I think that you can make a killing right now if you can get in the top rank on SEO or on YouTube doing reviews and um scientific summaries and um FAQs on this uh on these drugs because you will then be able to affiliate link out that lead and if it's 500 a month and people are staying on this thing for multiple years you might be getting paid you know three thousand dollars a leader ten thousand dollars a lead or something like that right like it could get kind of crazy depending on what the lifetime value is of these things and so um I think that somebody who creates content for those Google searches is gonna do really really well right like if I go search I haven't looked at all the uh so a lot of the tools for this but well a lot of the when I went and I went and researched this like crazy and I used um YouTube and I used a bunch of different stuff to like learn about it the majority of this content is mostly for women who are overweight you know it's it's a it's overweight women and I went and I was like okay but is this what does this drug do for like kind of fit men I was like let's go you know like that's like the niche that I'm curious about like okay cool if you're handsome podcasters they're a niche for like uh like guy next door like you know what I mean um but I was like looking for like all right so if you're 300 pounds this could make you 200 pounds but like you know like I don't need to be less fat like I just want to you know how do I just I gotta Beam on his face at a B plus body yeah where am I going after this how can a Missouri eight become like a New York seven that's just what I wanted to know that was the niche um so I was trying to learn about it but there's like not that much content there's some content on about it on YouTube with like Joe Rogan and more plates more dates talks about it huberman is beginning to talk about it a little bit but there's not a significant amount right I also think that uh owning a Facebook group of people who are trying these things out would be even batching it by month like November you know ozempic bunnies and it's like you know here we go we're all going in how's everyone doing oh my God it's amazing oh you're on the fence click this link and you can get in you know like here's here's how it works and so I think that there's a bunch of different ways to be an affiliate for this stuff that so that I think is going to do well plus obviously the companies that are selling this stuff directly and you don't want to take this you're not you're not on board uh like I don't know I'm fine like I like I'm not like uh completely against the idea of taking it I just uh I play it safe when it comes to health stuff and uh I play it safe more more than anything else and so if there's a lot of unknowns and it sounds a little too good to be true I just gotta wait and like you know I get shredded next year's fine two years from now if I wait this out I'll be okay uh look all I'm saying this really is gonna make it so that nobody gets fat anymore then honestly being shredded ain't gonna mean [ __ ] anyways so uh not sure not sure how I feel about it you're just fighting the advances of of modern science at your own loss you know what I mean I'm like a flat earther of the body well and we should say like I do think that like being natural like I P I think there's pros and cons where they're like people are like well I don't want to take drugs and I'm like well like would you keep would you take and they imply that natural's better and I'm like I think that's actually a stupid argument because like I could go eat some seed that's natural and that can kill me and also like if you're if you're sick do you do chemo of course you do and so where do you draw the line as to like what you will and will not do and I love testing drugs and testing all my like I said new products because I'm like I actually want to find out where my line is you know is your like you could be like well I'm not gonna drive a car that's not natural and it kills people but I'm like yeah but it's pretty pretty sick cars are cool like so like it kind of makes it worth it so I I challenge people to ask themselves and for them they may say well I just don't want to take anything and I say that I think that's great do what you want but I always think it's like an interesting argument when people say they're unwilling to take a certain drug and I'm like well but you're if you drink this Coca-Cola or if you take Advil like where are we gonna draw the line yeah yeah we're gonna draw the line at things that um I already thought were normal and new things stay out I'm I'm what you call dug in I've made my mind and I'm not changing okay I have mental cleats and I'm in the ground right now um all right where do we go from here um let's move on so um other things oh wait wait let's finish up with weird things that you've explored that are not so much fun so dude this looks too good too so vaping weed I always thought that trade since 2004 and I used to so nowadays because I was like why what weed but I don't want like smoke and I was never like a weed guy but I like I remember thinking about this and I'm like I don't I don't really even like this drug but like the whole smoke thing seems weird and so years ago I bought a thing where I was like trying to research it's like crazy and like there's vaporizers but and there's this thing called the volcano you know what that is no it's like a 600 Vape thing that would like put Vape in like this plastic bag and you would talk better and run the room and I was like that's stupid and um so I like went and found this like wood maker who made like an oven that you light on fire it's basically like a meth pipe for weed and it Heats for the weed to like a certain temperature and it turns into Vapes and I was like portable Vapes this is gonna be a thing and then like packs came out how how far ahead of the curve are you on that so you started vaping 2004 that's crazy uh when did vaping become popular I feel like that's like five years ago five years ago but I was all my babies the other Vape that I thought was gonna be a thing and it never turned out I learned about vaping alcohol turns out that's not like there's not like that much science to it and butt chugging is actually the way to go but I was I was curious about like can you actually get drunk off of Vape so I remember like waiting we got to put up the picture of you with the incredible hiktan uh versus you now and this is the like uh Olympic infomercial how did you feel about that that's pretty messed up right so basically I posted a before picture on Twitter and my before picture it looks like I'm Kid Rock's nephew uh like before picture honestly looks like like somebody is staging a before picture it's like all right how do we make this as crazy as possible like yeah just like turn the knob up all the way like yeah like somebody said it looks like you got that guy definitely has a couch in his lawn later that day I saw a guy get shot in his leg with an AK-47 and a drive-by I it was the most hectic part of my life I was like this guy definitely has like a a loose you know hot dog in his pocket right now just dude I looked like a hot dog yeah so you um you know you are a man of progress you're a symbol of progress um so that that's amazing the uh other thing you said you're taking some like crazy wonder drug for your uh Achilles right now you want to talk about that or no I'm I'm looking into this thing and I've and I've tested it out a little bit uh it's called bpc157 so it's a it's a peptide which is it's hard to I I'm not a doctor I don't even like explaining this stuff but it's basically um like an amino acid and it okay we have no public math maybe we should also have no public science Well here here's why I started getting interested I started reading on Reddit on like the pept it uh what they call the peptide Reddit and this guy was like my shoulder has been hurting me for 20 years and I injected myself with this thing and like three days later I have zero pain and I've complained for like five years that my achilles and my calf I like it always I'm always in pain and so I was like screw it this one Reddit guy I'm gonna try this out and so I did it my cat feels amazing I have zero pain dude and so that's my point so I think and this is kind of what I wanted to talk about I so like I think that you can find patterns in non-quantitative places so Facebook groups forums article comments uh comments on um like when box or CNN or whatever when they post their articles on on Facebook looking at the comments and 90 of it is total nonsense but there's something interesting about like repeatedly seeing these things like here's a really like controversial one that was controversial at first but now we're like huh maybe it's not bad it's like when you were when I I follow all political Spectrum on Facebook so I can see like what articles are the trends and I'm like wow Fox keeps or Breitbart keeps posting about Wuhan lab and like a virus coming out of it like what what no this we did it this didn't come out this way but why do they keep saying this it doesn't feel like it can't be true someone ate a bat in their soup and that was what happened yeah that's what I thought but like this and this is just one example where nowadays we're like huh that's actually plausible maybe and so what I try to do is whenever I see these crazy things I try to say what's the repeated pattern and let me ask myself like what is the evidence not these people are crazy or this is stupid so like if I hear about a drug or a product my or my I used to say you're just nuts you're insane you don't know anything that you're talking about you're just be normal now I say well why are you saying that and like is there any evidence here's like for example here's one that was interesting and I'm not a political guy it just so happens that the political things are like way easier because there's way more of them I saw this like crazy Instagram handle say that Putin has cancer and he's like close to dying that could be total nonsense but I'm like that's really weird that someone would say that let me like go and research and then like I'm like research like oh wow you did cancel two like things recently so I understand why you could jump to that like conspiracy but like it's just like interesting to see like new ideas pop up and patterns that repeatedly happen and then to ask yourself why and that's typically how I find a lot of interesting Trends another one is like do you remember keto being really popular yeah dude keto's dead keto's keto's gone like I I would bet I haven't looked at it but go to Google Trends right now and type in keto and I bet you it looks like a mountain like we're on the right side of the mountain where it's going down and uh like you just start seeing these Trends where like people are like who does keto anymore or uh let you just start seeing these things and I find that so fascinating like to figure out where these subcultures are on the internet and what do people who are considered freaks what are they believing and actually which one of their controversial opinions is gonna prove to be true in like you know a couple years you know I got to give it to you um when you first started saying that you saw a guy on Reddit say that his shoulder pain went away and then you injected yourself I thought to myself this guy's an idiot but now I realize I misjudged you you're a biohacker we just needed to change we just we just went from mayonnaise to aioli and I love it recommended by strangers on the internet you need to say I'm part of the buyer hacker Community yeah it's like Indiana it's like Indiana Jones rebranding a male purse like he nailed it that's what I need all right let's go to the next one um okay I got something kind of interesting for you so uh speaking of Indiana Jones I saw a clue this is actually a good transition I saw a clip of the new Indiana Jones trailer I don't know if you've seen this have you seen the new movie trailer for Indiana Jones no I play sports and workout and stuff [Laughter] watch like wizard movies well he so it's played by Harrison Ford right but you know Indiana Jones is like the Remake but it's Harrison Ford again and there's in the trailer there's this one scene where Harrison Ford who you know he looks like uh you know like somebody calls him Papa now like you know he's uh he's a little older um he like rewinds the clock and he looks like young Harrison Ford in a scene and I was like I think they do I think the technical term by the way for people of that age is gray bush that's the preferred nomenclature show some respect pronouns are gray slash Bush so so I was like how do they do that thing where they like made him look young in that one scene like that was pretty pretty cool and I found out that the South Park guys have a company around this have you seen this the guys created South Park have this company called Deep voodoo and they raised a lot of money for it they raised 20 million dollars and what they're doing is they are creating deep fake technology for movies so they're like yo visual effects expensive as hell what if we can do it using Ai and deep fakes and the way this works is they actually were making a movie that required a lot of visual effects and so they were kind of building this technology in-house for their own production and I think something happened covet happened they shut down the movie and so now the movie is not happening but they they're like well how do we turn this you know turn this lemon into lemonade how do we turn this failure into you know something that could be successful and so they spun out the technology as its own company and they're like yeah we're gonna basically do this use this technology to make it easier to do visual effects and so then there's this uh I put a link in our dock here um oh no I didn't put the link in but there's a music video by what's his name uh Kendrick Lamar it was amazing okay you've seen this video it was amazing yeah dude I was gonna I was I've been looking into this you play sports you exercise and you also watch rap videos yeah yeah podcaster I'm a cool podcaster dude the Kendrick Lamar music video is so good it is so good it's magic they use this technology so what he's doing is he's I describe it like you you know it better than I do I've only seen it once sounds like you actually saw it in the wild basically if I'm uh it's just basically a close-up of Kendrick Lamar and it's just him rapping uh so it's Kendrick Lamar The Heart part five it's him sitting in a chair yep it starts off with him then at like the one minute 45 second Mark all of a sudden his face just changes into O.J Simpson and it looks like he's wearing the same shirt same hair it just just his facial features change too identical to OJ Simpson but he keeps rapping and it's not like you know sometimes you see these AI things where the mouth is like it's like not quite moving with the words and you would think that it'd be pretty hard to do with rap um but they did it it looks perfect and it looks like OJ then he changes it to Will Smith and he changes into Kanye then he changes into nipsy hustle he changes it and it just keeps morphing and if you look at the bio it says deep fake from Deep Voodoo special thanks to Matt Stone Trey Parker and deep voodoo uh for the production of this video and so that is uh that's pretty cool and I think this is kind of amazing these guys these guys uh you know the South Park guys that's kind of like a like some people look up to Elon and they're like wow Elon is the these that's the that's the best it can be career-wise you know he's the he's the Michael Jordan for me these guys are a little bit more like the Michael Jordan I agreement creation of South Park South Park's amazing the way they went about it the way they poured their heart and soul into it if you ever watched that movie what is it seven days to air have you seen this movie yeah it's awesome man which shows how they they produce South Park in one week every episode is in one in seven days and they just followed them for like a Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday and then it's like boom here's the the episode goes live and all right back to the meeting room tomorrow we got to do another one and we do that for the whole season and that's how they stay super topical with their with their um shows whereas other shows can't because they they film the whole thing over a longer period of time or they animated over a longer period of time so they can't do things that just happen um so they did that they did Book of Mormon so now then they they crush it at the play um you know Broadway play you know space now they're doing it with this product this uh technology companies production company I think they just signed a 900 million dollar deal by the way with somebody so these guys are just like crushing what not what 900 million dollar deal I think with a Viacom they signed a deal I think for South Park or uh I don't know if it's South Park or it's other shows too but it's That's crazy dude and I bet I wouldn't doubt if they're each worth something like 400 million dollars um these guys are like prolific and they've done it how long has South Park been around I think like 30 years and they're just sorry not 30 but they're just friends dude it's great yeah they're great man and like what's funny is these guys make like raunchy kid comedy and they've never had like a blemish like they've never really done anything wrong like the worst thing they've ever done is like gone to like the remember when they went to the award ceremony on LSD and they dressed up like JLo no so so there was like that there was an MTV Movie Awards where Jayla wore this uh Jennifer Lawrence or Lopez wore this like green dress that was like risque and like was iconic whatever the next year they dress up like they wore that actually I do remember this yeah that dress is Iconic so they tell the story they're like yeah we just like took a bunch of LSD and decided to do that and they're hilarious these guys are the best and they're super prolific man they're awesome laughs our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better so these guys I think they got to be our Billy of the week [Applause] [Music] a million dollars isn't cool you know it's cool billion [Music] so they signed a 900 million dollar deal with Viacom CBS in August of 2021 Book of Mormon their Broadway play has grossed 500 million in revenue and they just raised 20 million dollars for this new deep fake company um and basically they say you know deep fakes have this rap of being you know problematic because there's going to be fake news and there's going to be misinformation but also it's going to be really important for Hollywood films so things like um de-aging the character like in here and uh like Harrison Ford and Indiana Jones or the music video stuff that you saw their bet is that visual effects are too expensive and that D fake technology can make it much more cost effective to do creative work and um yeah it's kind of crazy so they they basically the movie they had a movie suspended due to covid they pivoted out the team and decided to provide deep fake tools to Hollywood um before that the thing they were making was a 14-minute comedy featuring a deep faked version of Donald Trump and so that's what got canned um did you just yawn during your own segment I've been doing a lot of talking here you know another good another good South Park thing another good South Park thing that I stole from them a long time ago was there's this video of them talking about storytelling we've seen this where they're like uh they're like we have one trick when it comes to sorts the one rule when it comes to storytelling and um it's like they're teaching a class I think on storytelling and they go anywhere you can say ant and then this happened he's like you know what when a kid tells a boring story like I came from school and then my mom said this and then she said I could have some candy and then I said I got the kitty and then it's like this is the most boring story ever just you know kill me now and then yeah yeah and then is that that key word where you're not providing any twists and turns that would make this an interesting story you're just layering on more [ __ ] more [ __ ] more [ __ ] and so they're like swap that with a but therefore so instead you would say I came home from school and asked my mom for candy but she wasn't home and she's always supposed to be home therefore I went outside and I started saying mama but the only person who was there was this uh my neighbor who's always creepy blah blah and so but and therefore make for an interesting story whereas and then makes for a boring story so they can literally take a script and just cross out all the sort of like and then uh types of of connector words and replace them with a button so or a button therefore someone tweeted um why do you like my first million and we got like hundreds of replies and the Common Thread was um Sean just oozes and drips Charisma and his storytelling is so good and just just addicting and saying everybody laughs one guy goes Sean's got such good stories and he's such a great Storyteller sorry Sam yeah I don't know what was going on there I think because I retweeted it so it was like you know people who like me I guess who were replying but um yeah they were like you know uh the experience the stories whatever I was like I feel like your experience of stories and like crazy weirdness is what makes the podcast tick I really believe that I think oh here's another compliment I got for you I was actually going to start the Pod with this I forgot I was when we were at that um like you know weekend retreat or whatever uh I had asked somebody a question I was like because I'm trying to think about what to do in my life right I'm like okay sold milk Road thinking about what's next and I was like okay I think life comes down to like picking the right thing to want so like picking what you want and then bending reality to make it happen yeah and picking the right thing to want in the first place is almost even harder than becoming a reality Bender like at this point I believe I'm a reality Bender that was hard that was the first 15 years and now I realize oh shoot if I am a reality Bender I better pick right and so I said so I asked somebody I go I go who's there I go man who do we know who who are examples of people that I feel like they pick the right things to to care about and to work on and like go like they pick the right goals basically and then they've been reality and make them happen and I was like who's like a plus at both of those things and I thought I would have this like handful like just like a basket full of examples that I could just be pulling out from for inspiration and what I found was that even the people who I think are super smart most of them were picking like dumb things to to think about care about work on right like they were not picking well and then a bunch of people who picked well weren't ever gonna Bend reality to their will it was like yeah I talked to them five years ago still wanted that here we are five years five years later now no no real progress you know they're still just Trucking along kind of like they don't really they haven't really figured out how to make it happen so like I'll give you some examples of what I mean by this so we have a buddy I'll kind of pick on a pick on them but I won't say his name very successful probably worth I don't know 100 to 200 million um I feel like has just been batting a thousand like just had wins ever since the age of like you know 24 like just kind of first thing worked in a small way next thing worked in a big way now they're doing a new thing you know that's you know or in between they invested in a bunch of things good Investments um now they're doing a new thing it's sure enough it's working and they make it look easy to the point where I was jealous I was like damn this person makes it look easy and I'm like but the problem is and I even told them this I go I feel like you beat the level of this video game and then instead of going on to the next level you just hit reset on your Super Nintendo and play that same level again and you're doing that thing where you're just almost like trying to speedrun that same level like perfect you know like people who play Mario and they're like I'm gonna perfect this level right it's like dude just go to the next level and have a different Adventure have an improved Adventure right like more challenging or more and there was first they were like when I told them this day I was like um they were starting a new thing it was working everybody else was patting them on the back being like you've done it again it's working I can't believe how easily you're able to make these things work and I was sort of like I feel that way but I also feel like you're playing the same level of course you're making this work again you already know how to do this um they did a thing recently where they bought a company and they were super pumped that the company like and it was a great buy they made a great buy they bought a company it's not like they had a background buying companies they just did it they bought the right thing it wasn't available on the market they found the person they convinced them to sell it's making a few million dollars of profit a year they're gonna pay back their whole investment in you know 15 months or something like that it's a fantastic buy by all accounts but why why are you doing that what what does that bring to your life you're already worth you know 100 to 200 million dollars this two million dollars a year of profit is not doing anything except for distracting you from maybe what you should focus on which would be something else and um it's kind of nitpicking you know like a you know somebody who's you know amazing I think at a game so I kind of don't want it to be I don't mean it in a negative way I just made it in men it's really hard to find somebody who picks the right [ __ ] and knocks it out the park and what do I know as I'm brainstorming I'm like dude I think Sam is that guy because I thought of a couple people but I just like last night when I was thinking about this I was like dude Sam is the best example let me tell you why I remember when you were um like you've done a bunch of things where you're like I'm gonna motorcycle across America it was like like not what everybody else was picking you weren't just following a herd um you then immediately went and did it so you've done a bunch of things that like I feel like you were choosing you didn't just do what everybody else was doing and each one added to your like life value uh so it's like oh this trip across America right or this way to make a bunch of money uh you know because having a bunch of money gives me this like safety net and ability and Ammo To Go do cool stuff even after you uh so the newsletter was another one where it's like what the hell is this guy doing uh but you figure it out you've been bent reality to your will you made it happen and you were completely right right I I was like oh you're gonna do a Content company and your answer is I'm gonna do better content and I was like where's the disruption where's the technology where's the new platform what's the what's the pitch and the pitch was like yeah like you ever read this stuff man it's dry it's boring it doesn't even like it doesn't speak to us and I was like your plan is to be less boring right like that was literally your pitch deck for the hustle I called it The Daily Show effect yeah but it's gonna be like a little funny yeah I was like dude that is not a pitch I remember I was trying to give you like help I was trying to help a friend and it turns out I needed the help it was so stupid it was so stupid I can't believe it worked if I'm being honest like I was right in a way that it didn't become like a multi-billion dollar company because you were doing some like crazy crazy [ __ ] but like so it may not have been the right investment so I maybe I was right there but but who cares because you were like dude I'm gonna own 90 of this and I'm gonna sell this I'm gonna have you know like whatever tens of millions of dollars in my bank account which will let me live and do whatever the hell I want by that time I'm 30. and then sure enough it's exactly what you did reality to your will you picked the right goal you were like I'm gonna have this like huge financial War chest by doing the thing I know um I'm gonna have fun build a cool brand and meet a bunch of cool people on the way like you did with hustlecon so you did that then you were like all right should I do this Airbnb thing he started thinking about luxury airbnbs and short-term rentals and creating a portfolio there and I was like wow how does he think of it like well you again that's not where most people are going with their next step of their career and you started and then you and then the thing you pick now which we don't talk about too much now but like um eventually yeah I think is the perfect project for you and it's the perfect project for where you're at I'm like damn he did it again I even texted you this I go your project selection was so perfect all I can do now is try to think of the second best project to pick for myself I'm always my reply to you did you remember uh dude you had this you know you stopped right or something like that yeah yeah because I actually I I didn't want to say too much because then it'll kind of give it away but like yeah I had prototyped the same idea um liked it but I was like you know didn't have it all kind of figured out and I wasn't really ready to go do a new thing and so I just kind of like I took the like the quick win and I moved on and you were just like oh wait that's like you know that that's actually you figured out the right way to do it and you're doing it and it's amazing and it's gonna work so dude I just want to say I think you're that guy and I think this is a really important thing to figure out is who are the people that you think um choose the right things to focus on and then are able to bend reality to their will because that's like the one-two punch that is uh like most important in life and I think that um well thank you for those compliments you guys one more one more it's not just about work right so it's like Fitness right if we showed that before and after like you really like made it a point to get in phenomenal shape health-wise that's and and not just like you're not just like shape but like Mobility strength athleticism like things that actually like are de-aging right like they're the reverse reversing aging rather than just how many friends do we have that just basically are like only focused on stockpiling success and money and you meet them and you're just like dude like you're just going downhill right right like the Aging is like it's going at Double speed so yeah you're making more money but you're doubling your age rate by the stress the lack of the bad lifestyle that you're living right like it's not good um and so that's very common and I think you're uncommon in that the last one is like let's say family or relationships that sort of thing too like how do you make it a point to be good at that right choose the right Focus or I want to have this great family life and then bend reality to your will and so I think uh I really respect that you know about you and I think that that's something that I'm looking for more models of that in my life because um I now realize that that's the most important one-two punch well thank you I think not to take out with you on this podcast but yeah if you want like buy me dinner first uh but I think you got you you we've flattered you uh with this tweet so you got your ego I was I was I messaged Sean I go God these guys really hurt my feelings um but I think the what I learned the reason why I'm able to do some of these things one I think it was Guy Richie he said something like you are the director of your own movie uh and whenever I heard that line I was like oh yeah like I don't like this game I'm playing but I also make up the rules so I'm gonna I'm gonna make the rules for my game I'm like it's like I only have myself to blame if I'm not happy because I'm I make the rules and so that kind of changed my perspective and another thing I was working with Sophia amoruso that she's um The Nasty Gal that's you know big company and then now she's got business class this new thing she's her and I become great friends and she was like hey I need some help with my 2023 goal setting and I was like cool here's um my framework for doing this uh let's sit down and sit for an hour and do it and I was like Sophia how are you so successful and you've never like written down like what you're proud of the previous year what you regretted what would make you happy to accomplish this year what those no like I'm like I was like all right so here's how much money how much money do you want to make what would make you happy okay that number all right great let's work backwards I have a plan all right cool what about I always do Family Fitness Fun Finance so I'm like all right what about relationships what would make you proud in one year to be all right let's do um uh uh your body uh you know where do you want to be physically let's write down a plan for that and like boom so we just set aside this time that was our worry time this was the time where we're gonna stress and we're gonna worry about what's gonna make us happy and we're gonna make a guess that boom that's gonna make us happy then we're gonna stress on this plan have we settled is the plan done the plan's done I'm not worrying about it anymore all I'm doing is executing this the worry time is done next quarter I'll give myself eight hours on a Sunday then I can worry then but between now and then there is no such thing as worry all that all that there is is I'm executing the plan the worry time already happened and I've got scheduled worry time in the future and so what I think a lot of people don't do is they don't spend enough time sitting down and saying what do I want what are the rules of the game that I'm going to play and let's create those rules and literally write them down and for the next some period of time I'm going to follow those rules as best I can and then we're going to reassess are those rules actually good and I don't think people do that systematically enough so you said something like you know I didn't like the way that the movie was going but then I realized I'm the director and I could switch it like what what was that point and what was the movie like before and then what what did you make a point to switch well um you know when I was between the ages of like 19 and like 23 like I had some substance issues and I got in trouble and everything and I remember this sounds like really lame but I remember watching a concert it was actually Oasis which makes us even Lamer and they were singing a song and I remember like watching yeah it was like really lame I remember I was like drunk in bed like watching this YouTube video and I remembered like the singer was outputting very little energy like and yet there was a hundred thousand people in the crowd singing back to them and I'm like wow that's leverage man this guy wrote this song in his bedroom and it's like because it's such a good song and he has such an interesting personality that he's got like a hundred thousand fans as well as 40 million views repeating back to him the words even though he's exerting a little bit of energy that's leverage that's the ideal way to live your life is to have leverage and I'm wasting it and so I remember like changing it around after I saw that and I'm like that is uh I was like I think I'm special enough to do something like that I don't know how I'm going to do it but I know I have the ability to get there but I'm wasting it by not leveraging myself and I can only truly have leverage if my focus on like what my goals are going to be so I remember like going through that and like that is really what changed it and then moving to San Francisco and meeting you meeting a couple other people and it normalized achieving goals and then I realized okay great I can bend the reality easily I know how to do that now I just got to figure out on what do I want and then just figuring out like what's a holistic one so I met a couple people um who it's like they weren't all focused on work and I would ask them why they're doing something and they're like because it's sick and I was like oh that's cool life can be fun like it doesn't does have to be about money and uh yeah I remember changing when I lived in Nashville when I was a loser I was like I'm a [ __ ] loser right now but I know I have a knit Factor and when you uh you met people whoever who had a holistic like a holistic want is that what you called it yeah like or I'll just like read about them so like Laird Hamilton you know Laird Hamilton yeah like he interests me or like Rod dierdick were these guys and I'm like you're just doing dumb [ __ ] just to do dumb [ __ ] and they're just like yeah but it's fun and I'm like oh my God you're so right that it is fun I that I need to have more fun so like I remember like reading or talking about them on the Pod and that like kind of has changed a little bit too yeah and you kind of seem to like these people that um like they kind of chart their own path or they're like they just they do it somewhat like uh like Rob Dyrdek you know it's like he's a skateboarder makes a kind of like a show that's like um you know hanging out with his friends and it's like the Fantasy Factory and like all this stuff right like it's kind of like you're fun but it's like have fun on blast or have turn your fun into a business in some way right is that is that kind of like a good description like why do you like those personalities more than um you know whoever you know the the traditional people that people look up to like I don't think most people in in who are entrepreneurs when you say who do you think's kind of got it figured out or who did you look up to they're not like Laird Hamilton and Rob Dyrdek right that's like a unique thing to say so why is that because most people don't live life intensely enough and because they and they I think they don't live it intensely enough because they're afraid and I'm afraid too but then I see people do stuff so like for example um like wouldn't it be cool if we owned like a farm and we just go out there and just like shoot guns and ride motorcycles and like have a blast like that would be fun like if you're just like sitting around you're like I wish I could do that it's like cool you could do that you're gonna make this much money you're gonna save it you're gonna go buy this Farm then you're gonna buy all the motorcycles and then you're gonna tell all your friends about it and like now you have this thing like you can do that like or like or some people are like man it'd be like I like cars I'm like I wish I just had a warehouse full of cars and I could sit around my friends and just like Tinker on the cars I'm like great you can do that like I I just think that you can make any rule you want and then like make it a reality so that's why I just like get off on that and I don't think people uh even when it comes to work Fitness or fun that they dial up the the they're living at like a three when they it's very easy to turn into an eight so what would be let's say before your 20 your 20 two or whatever and now you're 30 what are you 31 32 third uh I was born in 89. what does that mean I'm 33 33. okay so you're 33 years old and I feel like you did a kind of like you dialed up the knob on Fitness right we saw the before and after photo I told you I I tweeted I think I texted you two years ago I go I'm gonna become a fitness influencer this year yeah I know this might not have been the right thing to want actually maybe I'll take that back it's not but like I the point being I was like I'm gonna guilt myself into getting fit right uh the second thing is you turned up the knob on finances so you went from broke to uh never have to work again right like you broke to rich um you went from you know single to you know married and and with somebody you love you went from um uh I don't know if you were having a lot of fun then but like I think now you have like your I have a lot of fun where you can like go and shoot you know shoot guns motorcycles work out you know whatever you live in different places different times of the year right you're crafting that whatever lifestyle you're you're into right now all right so that's 33. what's the next holistic want for you so that 43 is is it just more of the same like do the same thing like enjoy this for the next 10 years or is it there's another so there's another level you're you're looking to breach um financially if I'm not worth at least 150 million dollars by the age of 40 that would I would be considered that would be a Miss on my goals now that's what's the meme I'm not worth 150 million dollars you know I'm gay and my parents die yeah like like obviously that's gonna have no impact on happiness but that's just like the goal I have um uh so that's that's it I think well I by the way why would you do something that has no impact on happiness why would you want to bench 300 pounds it's just because that's well but like some people do like I I because I set goals and I hit them that's why because that's what I do that like you know like I I don't know I just I I thought that would be a cool goal and I think it's really fun the Journey of like achieving that is cool like I think it's like uh you'd respect yourself if you've pulled that off yeah because I'm afraid that I can't do it therefore that's my that's not my goal because yeah um so I don't know like why do you wanna why do you wanna why do you want to be ripped like it's I don't know if it'll make you happy but it's like it's just a cool little thing um and then um I'll have kids so that will change a thing but what I really want is I want to own more property that can I want to own compounds that's really what that's that's kind of like a goal is to have compounds so you remember when we went to Camp MFM and um we were at basically a compound I want a bunch of sick ones of those and regardless if I'm there or not I'd be like yeah you guys go and use the compound you could have it um that's really what I want I care about physical space like that I think that that would be a a something I'm looking forward to but no I don't really have that many goals other than those things I just want to live a dope life and I'll be good at that just just be a be a [ __ ] man like I get I get Pride out of being being a man and like well I just like look I I am fearful of everything that everyone else is fearful of and probably even more I would say maybe I'm even more sensitive to that and so I think it's fun to be like I'm afraid to have this hard conversation therefore I must have this hard conversation with this person and I feel like pride and like being a man and like honoring you know whatever I'm afraid to have this conversation therefore I must have this conversation yeah yeah yeah yeah you know what I mean like you know what I'm saying like it feels good to like uh be like look I'm brave I could do it I just get I get off on those things yeah there's a part of me that's a lot like you and there's a part of me that's not that way at all but it's really funny just to see that just dialed up to 10 and it's like yeah that's just how he lives and that's what's important to him like you said it's really like what did you say oh it's really important to be a [ __ ] man yeah like for me to be a lucky man and I just found that that's hilarious I've never I thought I have never had well you know like somewhere so different in that way someone told me they're like real men don't change their opinion based on every little like bit of emotion or Insight that they have and like I and I remember up into that I remember at the hustle and you do you do this too and and I do this all the time where I'm running a company and something bad happens and I'm like oh the company's ruined um like our quarterly plans are [ __ ] Everything's Gonna Change I've got to fire everyone and then someone told me they're like men don't behave that way and I was like oh you're right like like I got to be a man about this and I cannot let I cannot get emotional over this some of this stuff I have to like like no there's not been meaningful data yet to show that I should change my opinion this is just normal like you had like 40 more jewelry 20 percent more uh tint on your glasses and 80 more of an accent you could be entertained you're just like a few tweaks away dude you're like a [ __ ] I'm like making this dish I test the sauce little um Romania Eastern European I need a little bit of that a little by the way a little more jewelry little man jewelry you could be Andrew Tate I call about Andrew Tate as having he was the like it was a breakout Year in 2012 and then I read about what his um uh what about what he's accused of doing and like some of the evidence and then I saw like a video where he admitted it do you see the video where he admitted it no he admitted it he like talks about how he manipulates these girls into being on webcam and how he like he just says horrible [ __ ] I want to say that that pick is sort of like Time Magazine making Hitler the person of the year in 1938 like do that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it was like two years before World War II Hitler was times person of the year are you serious I swear to God yeah I don't know what year it was Time Magazine Hitler person of yeah let's find out what year it was uh 1938 yeah I was right uh 1938 he was times person of the year because he came in power and he like made a lot of change but like what a sick reference by you just now to draw that analogy and nail the year and talking about a magazine and work that was dude because like here's the thing that was wonderful because yeah by the way Google it you could see the picture there's like a picture of him on Time Magazine when he was person of the year you can be breakout of the year and also a piece of [ __ ] and I want to say Andrew Tate breakout person of the year huge piece of [ __ ] you got to go and see what this guy says now also the thing about pieces of [ __ ] you could be 90 all right and ninety percent of the things that you say can be like oh yeah that's a really good point you've just inspired me to go work out and but ten percent of it it could be horrible and because of that I dislike you and that's kind of what he does to me we're at like 90 I'm like yeah that's a great line you're right oh great let's Empower men to exercise and have confidence ooh but anytime you use the and then someone's race I'm out you know I actually don't know if he said that but like anytime I hear like the Jews or the blacks I'm like yeah I'm out dude I'm not on board with that all right so this is officially the Bro episode or the Bromance episode we did semi-glutide and the weight loss get shredded apart we did South Park creators as Billy of the as Billy of the week we did uh Sam's you know therapy session slash me sucking up to Sam um we did be a [ __ ] man as uh as the internal monologue and I think this is the Bro episode The Bromance episode I hope uh by the way we said something the other day we were like you know to our four female fans um thank you for coming we it's like uh at every Indian wedding for some reason my mother-in-law she has to give a speech where she thinks individually everybody who came from India because there's like just like she's like they came so far I have to say thank you this auntie for coming stand up please and everything and then she says and this person came also from so far stand up please and it's like the worst speech you've ever seen that's how we are with our four female fans where we're like thank you Ashley you are still here so so appreciate it um sorry about the be a [ __ ] man part earlier is that probably boring and or offensive um but thank you so much and so they they dm'd us uh after we made that joke on the last spot and they're like hey female fan here um you know whatever I love it and so I hope we just didn't lose them after this episode we did this was not the Bro podcast everything we said that's good regardless of who you are be a [ __ ] man change it to be a [ __ ] woman you're all right all right we're out of here before we get together let's go let's leave [Music] foreign

I lost 10 million dollars a lot of people know the story of flow the project management software that I built where I basically poured 10 million dollars into it because I was competing with Asana and didn't understand the dynamic of you're fighting an army that has unlimited budget it's like Fiji fighting the United States and I'm going like I'm gonna win this it's ridiculous and so I lost 10 million dollars doing that and that was a great lesson but incredibly painful and I wish someone like me had tweeted and I could have read it instead of losing all that money

you either die a hero or see yourself live long enough to become the villain and a lot of people misunderstand that they think that it means you start out as a hero and then eventually descend into being uh you know a bad guy and they look at Harvey Dent they think that's the moral but that's not what was what what Harvey Dent was saying Harvey Dent had actually always been a kind of crooked power seeking political type he had always been the same person fighting for the same ideals and that he just lived long enough to see the world change around him so that people started saying that what he was was a villain

foreign [Music] amazing weekend and I want to tell you about it go for it I want to hear about it all right so uh we've done these before but I'll explain kind of how they work for for people who are listening so about once a year maybe twice a year we do these kind of like friends slash founder weekend hangout type thing so by the way sorry you should have been there I don't know why the invite got lost in the mail don't worry about that oh I'm worried about it you're lucky I could you're lucky I couldn't have made it but I'm worried about it I was gonna text you um while we were doing it and I was like wait why isn't Sam here and I was like Ben do we did Sam say no or did we not tell Sam and then he was like I don't know this whole thing got screwed up uh because we whatever we bumped it back twice and then this happened anyway so um once twice a year go somewhere rent an Airbnb uh four to five kind of founder friends and hang out and the but this one was different this this one was a intimate birthday thing as opposed to last time we did it it was like a 20 person one um maybe yeah I don't even remember it got bumped back twice so at this point who knows um but basically it was like all right start the new year let's all get together hang out and do whatever and so we um we go to San Diego we rent um an Airbnb from Mark Jenny who you've talked about on the Pod before just to explain what he's doing he founded a company called RV share which was like Airbnb for renting RVs and grew that sold that for I think a hundred million dollars and part of it yeah I think he's part of it yeah private Equity to KKR I believe I think he's actually sold twice so he sold one chunk the first time second chunk recently and um and I think he still owns a piece of it but anyways RV share a really successful business he's got a crazy story where I think he was like homeless at one point in time and and made the whole thing happen we'll have him on shortly but very inspirational person he now has an airbn a luxury Airbnb portfolio worth about 50 million dollars and so he's got I don't know 20-something properties and he goes for the over-the-top kind of like destination experience uh you know maybe like party type of um houses so this house like like family parties family or like uh buddies going for a golf trip um you know type of thing where it's like like his one of his most successful properties that is in Scottsdale Arizona and we're like Scottsdale why he's like oh people guys go there for golf trips and so you know eight buddies get together and they rent my place and it's great and they all have money and so the price isn't as big of an issue or whatever so this one is in San Diego and um the backyard I think this guy must have put somewhere between one and two million dollars into the backyard so he um we get you go outside there's a basketball court there's a pickleball court there's a wiffle ball field with a fence like a full baseball diamond basically there is golf course there is like pool sauna everything you could think of it is like a boy uh you know boy Paradise basically little boy Paradise it's perfect for us right but that's all we were doing you go inside the house you know there's like a full poker table with the poker set with the perfect chairs there's pool table there's all kinds of good stuff anyways so we get there and um a couple of really cool things happen uh one Mark came over for dinner uh he's like uh you know hosted dinner for us there and he was telling us his story which is kind of crazy but I kind of want to save that bit for the podcast um I've asked him to come on tons of times by the way he turns me down and I'm good friends at Mark and he turns me down he's like oh no I'm with my family all summer and yeah he just had a baby so I think I'm like I appreciate that I appreciate it I think he'll do it um he's definitely he listens to the Pod so you know instead of listening one day for that hour just come on and talk like it's no extra time for you Mark and so then the next uh so we we kind of hang out first day is just straight Sports mail bonding sweaty male bonding let's call it and uh we're just playing every sport that's there uh and in between we sort of talk business or whatever second day we I tweeted out I go who's in San Diego and a bunch of people replied Ben goes through curates and is just like all right these 15 people seem cool I'm gonna invite them over to the house so they come over the house and I just want to set the scene of this kind of like party uh first of all first of all this whole segment should be called Sean leaves the house because I'm explaining how cool this was this is probably a monthly occurrence for you uh to me I was like dude I left the house I met all these cool people it was amazing because I never leave my house and so this time I was out of my house I met a bunch of cool people but you still didn't leave the state I didn't leave the state no I I barely got on a flight so so so here's the scene in the room uh there is two guys who own nft projects that have probably done 200 plus million in sales wow um they're both under the age of 23 mid 24 maybe um so that's kind of crazy one of them one of them didn't even have a public identity until like you know a month ago so that was uh people know Frank from from D Gods so D Gods was the number one project on Solana uh it's like the board Apes of Solana and um and yeah he basically uh he just kind of said hey hey here's my real identity whatever so he can now show up to parties and say what he does whereas before he couldn't do that um okay second thing uh so that's one group then there was the d2c crew these are people who have built products that like created a product uh one guy um created this thing called gel blasters think like a Nerf gun or a BB gun but just with like gel pellets I love that um it went from like zero to I don't know if I'm allowed to say the number but tens of millions in Revenue in a year and then like has a crazy story uh I'm gonna get him on the Pod too to come tell this story but has a crazy story of sort of getting screwed over by one of the big toy companies they pretended to buy his company for like 100 million bucks and then he like does the diligence with them shows them all the design files the cad files the everything the specs of the product they fall out and then three months later launched like an identical product to to compete with them and like Steel his influencer marketing plan everything is a kind of crazy story there um other people in the room remember the mini Katana guy we talked about Isaac he came so he's there and he's showing me like how they basically do eight figures in Revenue without a single Dollar on ads and it's not out of Pride like he just can't advertise because it's like Facebook's like yo this is a weapon you can't advertise swords on Facebook so he had to get creative and was just like okay how do I make organic content that's so good you want to buy a sword tens of millions of dollars worth of this sword and um I thought that was pretty remarkable really super nice guy that came over um and he's like dude I was listening to the podcast while driving and I heard you guys talking about a katana store and I was like he's like I almost drove off the road I was like no are they talking about me who are they talking about and he's like that was a surreal moment um all right so he's there uh a guy you know a former CIA operative came who I think you interviewed for the Pod you did a pod with him and then we couldn't release it yeah we don't even need to say more because that already sounds juicy as a mother effort right we couldn't release it because uh he said a bunch of classified stuff and so this person I don't even know what I can say now but basically this is me speaking not him um but it's almost as if they convince people in other countries to become treasonous spies yeah spies is part of the trees if you've watched Jack Ryan this was like the real life Jack Ryan and we asked him all about that and then he left the government and he created a business and so there was a good overlap so I'm gonna tell you one so I'm don't say his name though by the way yeah yeah I'm not gonna do it so I was like uh I was like so how do you do it how do you convince somebody you're just this like you know American person coming into their country you know you go into Afghanistan or wherever you know Yemen or someplace um how do you convince them to like you know work for the US government to help us and he's like well um like two years of Rapport building and then it's you know it's manipulation right like you were trying to and I was like so how would you do that like I feel like you couldn't do that and he's like remember earlier uh when we were grabbing a drink you said you really want X and I was like no it's like in passing I must have said something he's like for about a year I will basically talk to this person and I'll find out they're every want their every need their every problem and I'm keeping a file and I'm keeping this file for years before I flip them and I was like Wow uh and this person's really I don't want to talk anymore he's very charming and he's very likable and when he tells great stories when he tells a story you're captivated he's gotten it factor and so when I was with them I was like oh yeah I understand why uh I would I would Commit This thing in order to like uh you know please you right so he told one story amazing I called four people over you got to hear this you got to hear this come here tell another one he's like um and I'm like [ __ ] I just yeah you're like hey you're funny tell a joke then he tells another Banger and I'm like and everybody's like oh wow to the last three people who didn't hear the first one get over here get over here get over here hey you got another one and he's like oh you know you know the thing is uh you know blah blah he's kind of having it hung and I was like look if the story [ __ ] no problem you're already you already won this is just a bonus lap if it's terrible I have no problem with you I already think you're amazing I just depressurized the moment for a second and I was like you know just try to give us one more he gives us one more and I was like wow this is a you know my friend Jason Hitchcock has this thing he says he goes uh you say one interesting thing I say huh interesting two interesting things I said those are interesting three interesting things I say you are interesting and that's what happened by the third one I was like you are interesting uh that's how I felt so that guy was kind of amazing and by the way I'll say um this kind of sucks to talk about because I can't reveal a lot but you and I have a friend and this person um is related to a bunch of like seals and CIA people and it just so happens that there's this weird community of like these xcia NSA seals all these like you know abbreviators yeah and well they they get out and they go and they start businesses because like I think I say have a pension so they have a little bit of money um like they have some of their basic needs covered and then they go and start businesses and we're they're in our world successful and they're very successful and it's I love hanging out with these guys you know and and they're like proper Heroes and then they're like talking to me about like internet and CAC and I'm like yeah but what about Isis like tell me tell me sorry about that like tell me that time you eliminated 18 Isis people you know what I mean it's like they're Heroes it's fun talking to these guys yeah and then um let's see who else so then uh our buddy Ramon is there Ramones there with his son and and uh Ramon's telling us Amazing Stories has he ever told you the uh contractor Story the best thing I've ever heard yeah you want to retell it yeah can I retell it here yeah I don't know when the next time he's gonna be on but he's like um and he's officially he's an American now Ramon's an American so that was the big thing he's officially an American we go out to before he arrives we go out we get him a cake from like the Safeway there or whatever and we're like um hey can you write a message on here like now it's closed for the day I was like bro you gotta write a message and you know convince the guy he writes a message uh welcome to America uh misspell's welcome so it just says welcome to America like sounds like the most non-american thing ever and that's right um he and I was like you know so you got your citizenship that's amazing what happened afterwards and his son Victor was like oh man in the car afterwards everybody who was calling he would just answer hello fellow Americans so that was amazing so he's uh at the dinner party we're like you know tell us a story uh no we were like um what's an icebreaker for a group like this it's like what's the what's the um weirdest way you tried to make a buck like what's the weirdest way you try to make money because otherwise in this type of scenario if you kind of say oh so what do you do people just go into their script yeah yeah and it's kind of the whole thing's just kind of pretentious because it's a room full of successful people and everybody starts kind of one-upping each other in this weird way so instead you want to like nag the whole group so this is the neg the whole group question what's the weirdest way you tried to make a buck um and Ramon's like uh you know he's got like 10 of these and we're like dude this is the thing about Ramon he's very quiet but when you start getting himself story it's like a vending machine like a endless vending machine of stories you've never heard of even though you know the guy for 10 years so he's like yeah uh back in the day I was like okay I want to start a construction uh what is it I'm gonna start a painting business he's like oh I need money I'm 18 years old I'll uh paint walls so he puts up a thing that's like I'll paint walls but you know being the Hustler that he is he's like I'll you know what how can I widen the top of this funnel let me just say painting handy van I'll fix anything whatever you got I'm in general I'm a general contractor I'll do generally anything and uh so he's 18 years only puts up his listing on the like the Dutch Craigslist like that and um he gets an increase next days it says hey um I need an electrician for some electrical work and he's like great be there tomorrow morning he's like um he's like I go to the store at Like Home Depot type store and I'm looking at like these vests I'm like which one looks more like an electrician like basically it's like Halloween he's like trying to find a costume and he's like I go there the next day and the guy's like um cool yeah so we need like you know uh 40 amps here and we're gonna do we're gonna run a line under the circuit over here he's like dude he's saying words like forget about knowing how to do it I don't even understand the words he's saying and he has a clipboard though but he's like reading his writing notes he's wearing the vest yeah yeah okay tell me more and he's like just because I just keep scrolling it's like a very complicated job he's like I hoped it was I was like dude what'd you think was gonna happen he's like I hoped it was like light bulbs like he's like electrical electricity yeah I don't know light bulbs and he's like once I got there I was like oh [ __ ] um but I'm writing I don't know what to say I don't know what to do so I'm like okay maybe I can figure it out you know open up the cert the open up the the thing there's just a thousand wires I'm like okay there's no way I know what to do here and so he's like um yeah listen man uh I think he tells him this the next day or something yeah he goes home yeah he goes home but he thinks about it and he reflects and he's like I gotta come clean to this guy like I don't know how to do I don't know anything I don't know what to do and he's like reviewing his notes he's like I don't know what any of this means yes he goes back he's like I gotta tell you man um I've never done electrical he's like I just needed money I thought I could figure it out and um slept on it turns out I can't I have no idea how to do this and the guy was like what the [ __ ] everything's also like you know what kid like he's like I'm an entrepreneur he's like um I respect the hustle I expect that you were honest and he's like everyone's like you know when you're honest and you're young um like good things happen and the guy he's like gave me a great lesson he's like you know what like instead of telling me like don't ever do this again he was like actually uh you know what you should do is you don't need to know how to do electrical work you got the job now you need to find somebody who does know electric work and subcontract it out and keep a margin and so you shouldn't be here anyways he should be doing that and he's like oh and he started an actual like general contracting business doing that from there and the guy like helped him out um basically gave him a job and helped him out and that eventually he did that for a couple years and he actually made maybe uh for sure hundreds of thousands I think he made close to a million dollars I think his first million was running that business and then he immigrated to America and he created a uh Brazilian Music Festival I have no idea why and he lost all of it and then he created more internet business and made it all again and then lost it all again and then made it all again and so he's done that a bunch of times very fascinating guy yeah even his current business so he has his business called Alpha paw and he sells like great dog products or dog ramps things like that and uh even that like whip up up up and then hits a then like you know when covet happen shipping costs went through the roof so like a container for shipping used to cost three thousand dollars then it started costing twenty thousand dollars so like a six hour increase and when you have a huge product you need a lot it takes up a lot of space so you need a lot of containers so his his unit cost blew up that was really tough and but he's so resilient so like he he's like all right what's the pivot and he pivoted to he's like dogs having trouble cats and so he's like all right and he made this kitty litter product called genius litter and now he just got a deal where he's now in PetSmart Nationwide which is amazing and now he's like back back you know in the now it's like dude I need so if you're listening to this you know the gentleman's agreement to go smash subscribe but also if you have a cat or you don't have a cat you got a dog it doesn't matter what you got go to PetSmart buy this guy's genius litter so his business uh you know thrives because this guy deserves the best guy I know so um you know so just amazing Stories one after another of each person about like bouncing back so there was a bunch of like I don't know takeaways I had from this number one storytelling wins there was a bunch of people at this event that were all equally impressive but it was the ones who understood how to tell a story that stood out and that everybody loved made a bunch of connections people started helping them out they're like oh you should try XYZ oh you got to meet blah blah blah and it was the people that didn't understand how to tell their story they only told facts and it was just sort of like I I'm you know whatever I'm Steve that's what I do blah blah everything's been great all right thanks Steve see ya you know like you know yeah you need some of that Sizzle yeah you they didn't have that Sizzle and so the sizzle the story telling Sizzle was so important and so obvious and then there's nuances like there were some people that were storytellers that every story was how awesome they were and you could just see it was like just repelling people like here's how awesome I am and then slowly but surely okay great got one of those stories I'm gonna go get a drink now see ya and it was the person who could tell a story that was like slightly making fun of themselves even the CIA guy he goes oh I have a rule I only tell CIA stories where I look like an idiot um I never tell CIA stories where I you know I beat the bad guys I fought five guys and then everybody clapped he's like I'll never tell a story like that and so I was like that's a great rule in general for people so that I think that was like one big takeaway second takeaway is I should probably leave the house a little more often this was dope and um I used to do this all the time and I kind of got a little cocky and was just sort of like yeah I got a great Network you know I don't really need to like put in like this but when I was in my 20s I used to do this all the time and this was just a reminder of how much value you can get by talking to other people in the game or like you know I think this podcast serves as that for people too where you hear these stories you get inspired you get ideas growth hacks and um and it's surprising how helpful people are so you know what I describe that as you when you're around certain people you realize that the world is malleable and you see all types of people who are bending the world to the reality that they want and then you feel like oh yeah that's cool I can do that too so it doesn't matter you're like I don't care for selling if you're if you're in the CIA if you're selling genius litter it doesn't matter it's just cool to see people who are kicking their Dent into the universe right yeah exactly exactly and um second thing I would say is there was a huge difference in life phase attitude all right what does that mean so we at this event so we had Ramon's son and his friend uh shout out to Jude he came so he's a fun kid too he's super fun kid super chatty chatty Kathy and uh but by the way the next day he was like he was holding up the gel Blaster gun thing he's like so they said they make this for whatever makeup numbers they make this for three dollars and they sell it for nine I was like dude he's already picking it up this guy's like 10 or 11. he's like that's a really big like you know margin and I was like wow you know margin that's that's really impressive um so so anyways we had people that were 10 or 11 we had the guys who were kind of like 20 to 25 the nft boys and then and D to see some of the DDC guys we had guys like us who were in our 30s and we were like all right yeah and I'll tell you the differences and and how each one was approaching it in a second we had guys in their 40s so that's like you know you know that sort of thing um and then we had then I went and met up with a guy in his 70s and like a husband and wife in their 70s so I saw all those life phases I want you to guess what do you think was the like notable like differences in those ages in terms of like what they cared about what they thought about what were the differences have you ever heard the story of like there's like an old bowl and a young bowl and they see a bunch of cows and the young bull goes let's hurry up and get down there and have sex with all them cows in the old Bowl is like whoa whoa whoa we can walk we could we could walk down there we could take our time and that's kind of the difference I imagine the 22 year olds are like let's do everything the 30 year olds were a little bit wiser the 40 year olds were like hey let's just pick and choose our battles a little bit more wisely like let's enjoy the process of the seven-year-olds were more so like uh none of it matters yeah exactly that's exactly right so the the T the teens or pre-teens they were basically just like you want to play what's what are we gonna play hey you guys want to play this while we play this it's like we were on the pickleball court and then in between points they're running and kicking the soccer ball and then right afterwards like you want to play Monopoly you want to do this and like till the last minute of the last second of the day it was like you want to play yeah and I thought that was like you know just an awesome energy to be around the other part of it was like um they also were doing Khan Academy a bunch and I was like wow they really like want to learn this stuff like that's kind of cool um you know that's that's kind of amazing that just kind of blew me away so they were all about play Then you had your guys in your 20s that were the I got it all figured out guys and I remember being that guy and it's like they actually do have a lot of Life figured out their way ahead of the curve but the problem is they think they're at the end of the curve they think they got it all figured out and so you listen to stories and they're saying things and you're like you know what four out of the ten things you just said were totally wrong but you know what it doesn't matter it the fact that you believe all 10 is gonna work and um and I just love that you think all ten are right I love like what are the odds that's a good way to summarize it yeah um but they were they were a lot of fun and their thing was just sort of like we're going huge like of course this is gonna work uh this is gonna be massive we got it figured out and um not in a cocky way just like they had only known winning and uh and I thought that was awesome because as you get older you start to take L's you take Health L's you take you see friends take L's you make big expensive mistakes you take those L's and that sort of humbles you a little bit and so this was pretty humbling and I loved it I loved that energy uh because you know even at first I was like man these guys are delusional and then I was like how do I hey pass the delusion please I'd like to sip on some of that uh that's a lot of fun actually I forgot how useful that can be um all right guys in their 30s like us weird middle State it's like I have a lot of self-belief but I now know how expensive it is to go down the wrong path whereas the guys in their 20s don't know how expensive it is to go down the wrong path wait they don't even know anything about the path though I'm just pathing I'm just passing bro I'm just on the path I don't even think about the fact that I could be doing five other things I'm doing this and this makes completely complete sense to me whereas the 30s were like you could do this I could do that and they're almost paralysis by analysis yeah um they've accomplished too much too much to just do something stupid like the guys in their 20s who created this nft project they were able to just do something stupid and it paid off they created this uh this you know gel Blaster Nerf gun because it just was stupid and they thought it was cool and like that was enough justification to do it oh that looks fun do it where's the guys interviews like that looks fun but uh let's let's spreadsheet this out real quick and just see well you know let's back at the envelope yeah like um when you have something to lose it changes a little bit right and so they back at the envelope themselves to death but you know they're still at least they're still thinking of the the difference was when you compare to the 40s the 40s were like we know what we're doing um when I hear about what all these other guys are doing I'm half amused and half of it exhausts me and I want to go take a nap like you're just confusing me with all these things that honestly like I don't feel like I need to know any of this stuff I I I'm perfectly happy not being in nfts and not knowing how to do Tick Tock videos to sell mini swords like that's cool but man I just want to go relax right now and the second thing was they were like one of them just like found out he was high blood pressure so he had a blood pressure monitor with him and he was like um just took his blood pressure and we were like I was like dude I never take my blood pressure put me in and so we took our blood pressure like four times a day just for fun but I was like you know they were like like you said they wanted to enjoy the journey so they were like yeah yeah we could talk business but like let's go play some pickleball that'd be fine yeah and I think um as you get older you you you respect all the different ways that you can get there but you know you're lame I know my lane and I know if I just do this all the time for I know what compounding looks like and everybody else looks very scatterbrained in comparison uh but the no other laners and I don't mean that in a discouraging way like they were they were definitely learning and and they've they've made adjustments but they weren't seeking the next hit they were just like I found a hit and I enjoy this hit and I want to also think about life and marriage and kids and health and that was a way bigger part of their their life like their their own mortality was more on their mind than proving themselves like the 20s and 30s and the older I get and the more experienced I get I understand compounding better I that was that that was a really hard thing for me to understand in my early 20s and late 20s and then once I like start seeing it work a little bit you start understanding it and you go oh wow so if I just do this all the time for 10 years like look at the uh I'll be in a better place than I will be if I start a bunch of different things and yes uh so you understand compounding a little bit better so you know well if I just stay in my Lane I can respect everyone else's what they're doing that's neat and I think that's cool and I can learn but if I just do this mostly the same I'm gonna I'm gonna get to where I wanna go yeah so that was the 40s and then the 70s were basically like some Contra come with some combination of I want to contribute so they were like pitching me a project that was like a philanthropic thing and I was like philanthropy oh okay that's what this is a different conversation that everybody else says all the other conversations I've been having all weekend and the second thing was they were just happy we came over to their house it's like when we were leaving I was like man it's gonna be really quiet once we leave here like is this uh oh man that's kind of huh who was the person can you say um I don't say their name just because I'm gonna like you know tell maybe I don't know what I'm gonna say about them so I don't want to say their name but like kind of like a successful entrepreneurial couple in San Diego um and so I was like you know I went to their house and I was like they were really nice really cool hosted us but also what's that fat house uh semi-fat house yeah like nice um yeah nice house but also when you see a house at night by the way it's like uh you don't actually see the house because you can't see anything around it and you can't see like you know you only see like a part of it it's just very different when you see house at night first during the day um but I just felt like the things that matter to them were their grandkids their kids marrying the right person figuring out how to like contribute and also just like their house not being so quiet there's like any liveliness in the house uh it was like a win it didn't even really matter what we talked about or what came out of it like I feel like us being there was a cool fun change of pace and I was like yeah I guess when I'm in my 70s I'm also going to want that a lot because I'll probably be kind of like at home kind of bored a bunch you know and so that was like also kind of a wake-up call for me it was like oh wow yeah yeah this life thing does go pretty fast here dude so it sounds like a sick weekend yeah it was a lot of fun that's badass yeah I have to talk to Ramona I gotta I want to learn all about it um or from his perspective but it sounds like a sick weekend yeah that should happen every six months yeah I think yeah I think we should do that uh again and also the um it was cool that um like even the house we were in was kind of like a business it was like this every this luxury Airbnb itself is a business and uh and it just kind of breaks your frame a little bit like I think that's a pretty important thing like how how often can you break your frame um and an experience like this twice a year I think twice a year you'll end up breaking your frame because you'll just meet a bunch of other people to do life and think about life in a different way than you I actually want to ask you about like a frame breaking experience um before I get into that I have to remind people that they owe us they're in debt to us if you just heard Sean's story he just went and spent the weekend creating these things to tell you about and then he like did all this work to do it and we do that every week three two times a week two to three times a week you're in debt to us so you owe us this is the gentleman's agreement part where you have to go to YouTube even if you're on iTunes or you're on podcasts or you're on Spotify go to iTunes right now my first million click subscribe and that's our gentleman's agreement and we'll be even and we'll be actually more than even because we're going to keep doing this and we're working for you once you subscribe that's all it's like a it's the most fair trade because once you subscribe we get in the algorithm yada yada but this is the gentleman's agreement part we can't check that you're doing this that's why it's called the gentleman's agreement is we just hope that you are so please do that um and argue with that you can't argue with that that's the they spent literally one second to click subscribe and we spend 30 hours a week coming up this content it's a very fair trade I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better I want to ask you about a frame breaking thing now that your how long has it been since the milk Road acquisition um two months maybe a month and a half something like that so you're still early into it um this February 1st is technically my last day at HubSpot that's two years so um and so now I'm two years into it and I've wanted to ask you and I have a list here but I wanted to ask you uh because uh I know that the guys running the milk road now or the owners are like recruiting interesting people because I like people like message me they go hey this person's recruiting me should I join milk road so like I'm getting all these like ass uh like to as your reference check um what have you learned so far about what it's like to be the founder of a company that's now owned by someone else is there anything interesting that you've learned I have a a list of a few things that are interesting to me but is there anything you've learned uh I feel like you got a more interesting answer than me so you go well I'll I'll I'll say a few things and these are a bit frame breaking um and so the reason I'm bringing this up is because I think someone once said like or at least this attitude exists a lot in Silicon Valley where they're like What's your exit plan and then everyone's like [ __ ] exit plans don't have an Exit Plan uh you're not building things to sell great things get bought they don't get sold or something like that and I actually think that's nonsense I actually think if you want you can build a company where you're like I'm gonna exit in like four or six years or two years and I'm gonna make like tens of millions or hundreds of millions whatever like you can build a company like that and I think it could be really successful um and so one of a couple frame breaking things that I had the first one building something from scratch is a very very rare skill and one or two focused entrepreneurs with close to no money can probably do more in six months than a 50 person team with millions of dollars in 12 months inside of a large organization and that was actually really challenging to me I remember HubSpot said they wanted to buy us and I'm like Doc Just Launch your own thing like I don't why would you do you know what I mean and being in at HubSpot now for two years I see it's really hard the reason it's really hard is the creative types who who are bold enough to go and build something they either aren't working at that company because they're out doing their own thing or they're just stuck in this political game where they want to impress their boss and it's not because a company's bad it's just this is the natural thing they don't want to embarrass themselves they don't have a significant amount of upside to see the win they don't get the dopamine Rush of the sale coming into Shopify and it's actually really really really hard to build something from scratch and so it's worth it to them just to buy something that's already working do you agree with that 100 um and you can see it when an acquisition happens the velocity of progress slows down like molasses it is uh it's like kind of remarkable now that doesn't mean it fails but the velocity definitely slows down other things go better but the velocity and the pace and the sort of like um yeah the aggression and productivity I think go down and that's what I describe as anxiety goes way down as an entrepreneur your anxiety goes way down your frustration way up that's the trade-off that you're going to make however this is another thing where I made this mistake where I would dismiss big companies and I would call them idiots that's actually in my experience not true and talking to a lot of people sometimes it's false they are idiots but sometimes um operating like if you're around good operators just like a good employee at a big company they can be significantly better operators and a lot of the things that we make fun of bureaucracy meetings things like that that creates redundancy and if you do it correct redundancy creates um predictability and predictability creates a value and that's why your anxiety goes down and so a lot of that big company stuff a lot of it's [ __ ] a lot of it's really necessary and the people inside those companies can actually operate things really really well do you agree with that [Music] um I agree that that's true I wouldn't say that that's the main value the main value that I saw inside of a big company was that when you're big um you have usually two things one is distribution so you could take something that doesn't have a lot of distribution and give it more distribution or you could simply say I don't really need to innovate let all these other people innovate and I'll just follow because I have size and so when I have size I don't need speed right and so it's like a sumo wrestler versus uh you know a sprinter or like a uh you know a a lightweight you know a lightweight wrestler or something like that and so you basically trade that distribution in size for for Speed I think that's the the first thing and um very hard to have both um and you know the when you're at a startup the EXP the mistakes are very expensive but when you're sorry when you're at a startup the mistakes are not expensive like I don't know how many things you do with the hustle that were like dumb or stupid or whatever just like roll it back um you know at the beginning especially you know whatever I don't have any customers anyways I don't have much revenue to lose anyways and I have a reputation to be burned the Press is not watching me uh Twitter doesn't care what I do whereas when you're big then your every move matters and every mistake is quite expensive um and so you have to be a little more careful and so careful is not a bug it's a feature when it's a big company and so I started to appreciate that they're not slow because they're stupid they're slow actually because they're smart because they don't need to go fast because they got size and mistakes are expensive so they don't take they don't try to make too many mistakes and um you know by going too fast and that brings me to my second to last point which is a lot of cool [ __ ] that you and I like to make you you and I are zero to one people like by definition we're not the best at one to whatever but a lot of the cool [ __ ] is completely illogical or really stupid and a lot of the best stuff starts that way this podcast you called it my first million pretty horrible name um my thing was called The Hustle pretty bad name and it was just a newsletter that's kind of like not like when I pitch it to bigger companies they go this is stupid this will never be big and the reason why it existed anyway was because I was beholden to no one we just said math whatever screw it we're just gonna do it when you're launching something within a big company you have to have logic you have to have reasoning you have to like make a point because you have to justify it for someone to fund it uh whereas when you're a nobody just two guys you say nah screw up we're just gonna do this we're gonna have an anti-black Friday sale where we charge more this Friday as opposed to less and just because just because we want to because this is funny it's completely illogical and illogical stuff works not all the time sometimes when I was hanging out with the 70 year old person I was explaining I said yeah I'm thinking about what I want to do next and you know I really want to pick a good project I want to pick a right the right way to spend my time um and he goes uh picking is hard and he goes and the hard thing about picking is that today she might look like a pimply chubby person you know here but 12 months from now as you take that idea you start dating it and then you kind of pivot over here you change one thing get a new wardrobe all of a sudden she's 120 pounds she's you know she's uh got her PhD and she just got word in the mail she's inheriting 72 million dollars and he's like he gave me this analogy and he goes that's the problem with picking is that the best things don't always look like the best things up front this comes back to a Peter Thiel saying which is the best ideas are things that sound like bad ideas but are actually good ideas and um why because those things have the least competition those things are the least done those things have the highest upside because of the most Greenfield uh things that are obviously good ideas are super competitive things that are actually bad ideas doesn't matter how hard you work they're bad ideas so The Sweet Spot is something that sounds like a bad idea but is actually a good idea and that's you know this guy put it in a uh you know you know a different kind of analogy that I I appreciated and uh I could just I'm glad I didn't you know say who because you know people get mad about that analogy but I thought it was hilarious and I understood what he meant which is you know when you started tell when you started the hustle you were like oh great it's this conference and I was like you know conference okay immediately like a lot of work you know seasonal doesn't get that big who cares if your product can get rained out it's kind of not good yeah yeah you have 200 tickets to your conference like all right Sam good luck you know and then you kind of fumbled and then you were like oh okay conference is working but you know conference ain't where it's at but I've been using content to drive ticket sales maybe I should just do this content thing through a newsletter and even that was still sort of pimply and didn't really newsletter I mean uh dude people over here make it flying cars and Uber and you're doing a newsletter like get some ambition bro like you know that that can't be big possibly right like aren't newsletters just like a personal thing people send out to their 50 friends and you kind of figured it out as you go and then now people are like yeah how many freaking I want to build the next hustle you know hustle for X you know how many people pitch you that myself included milk Road was a hustle cop yet after I made fun of you for the for doing a newsletter back in the day I was like you know I didn't invest in your thing because I was like I don't think that's gonna get huge right and I was like but you knew some you figured something out along the way that was not obvious up front and by the way the hustle is very close to Crossing three million subscribers and that brings me to my last point which is planning is something that I had never done like when people were talking about okrs which is like a framework for running your company they would put it on a quarterly scale and I'm like yeah how about a weekly how about a weekly one so we could like every single day we're gonna create something new and that's really important for starting out and I don't think you should plan too much right you can't worry about a b z uh which is I I actually came we we both uh separately had like the same thing where I'm like I care about steps one and steps two and then like I'll worry about step I think about step 10 as inspiration but I don't worry about three four and five um and so that's important when starting stuff but one I don't know when that point is maybe 10 million 100 million in Revenue I don't know what it is but planning is needed it's necessary and it's incredibly important and that's what big companies do really well or they try to do it well and as I'm growing my new thing I'm trying to like bake this in of like planning and not worrying about like uh looking like like you know I could have like a quarterly plan it's okay I could I could even have like a six month plan I remember when we were selling the hustle we sold we were around four years old and they wanted like a five-year projection and I'm like what like uh that's that that's not even like I I can't even comprehend five years I don't even know if I'm gonna be interested in this yeah one of these nuts what are you talking about you want me to write down a lie yeah my lies are verbal there's no paper trail he's trying to get me to write this down dude it was ridiculous and now I understand like it's actually okay to like kind of have some of these plans so anyway that's my list of things that I've learned like being like seeing the buyers um perspective just a little bit and I was just curious if you had any insights it might be too early yeah well let me tell you the different things that they've done so first they hired a bunch of people we were running the thing with basically three or four people and then one one freelancer right like it was very very lean they you know basically one dude wrote the email every day and then me or Ben edited it and that was like that's how the the whole product the whole product was basically created by that now there's like a second writer there's an editor there's a head of content it's like who who are all these people what are they doing uh is it is the content getting better I'm not sure right like but they've hired up people which like you said builds redundancy because if the main guy got sick which happened a couple times it was like red you know Red Alert yeah um you know if we got a fact wrong it's like I didn't have time to check it you know like you know we didn't we didn't have those things in place and so you know I think they've they've basically taken I would just say in general they took a longer term View they were like okay we're gonna be doing this for a number of years so what do we need to get to this point two years from now and let's start taking those steps today where I was like all right next month what would be sweet yeah well because you're like planning exercise you're in survival mode I had a even if it was a survival mode because it was like okay we got the business working it would be like I just wanted every day to be a new adventure and like that's not how these people think when they are like long-term oriented they want each day to not be an adventure they want each day to be like you know it's the difference between you know um you know people who go for these like long hikes and uh you know a sprinter and like you know I was just more of a sprinter and so literally our goal planning we would say like what's the minimum thing that would feel like a win we call it a good win ah that was good and then what's the F yeah win where we would be like f yeah dude we did ABC right that happened and that's and we that would create our goal and then we would shoot for the feat we would make sure we don't miss the good um and like that's what we did every single month and it was a little bit more um and if we didn't hit it it was a problem like I immediately was like soul searching like everybody stop and let's figure out where we've gone wrong I'm ready to change every anything and everything which is not always the right approach sometimes it is right like these things serve you and then sometimes they hurt you and so I would say these guys they put more money into growth they hired more people and they don't panic there's the three differences between us uh and I think their approach has some bad things and I think it has some great things and we'll see you know how it all plays out now I think I read somewhere where someone was like I was reading some like thing about masculinity and like the difference between a man and a boy and like a real man doesn't let like lots of different uh or doesn't let like shallow input change his emotions and change his plans and I remember when I was running my company I would always get emotional I'm like no man if I gotta be a man I gotta like be calm and I can't panic and I used to think like oh no it was cool to be like Mark Zuckerberg and seeing go go in and see oh this isn't right you're [ __ ] fired it's like no real men don't do that you know they could like they don't panic and they don't freak out and that kind of changed my perspective on that a little bit Yeah my trainer he's been teaching me this he's like Okay so like you know you're doing a set so you're you're bench you're bench pressing or whatever and let's say you picked away that the first you know three reps four reps are easy the next four reps are getting harder and then the last three four reps let's say you're going to twelve uh the last four reps you're like you know it's kind of shaky and you want a spot but more than anything I don't know for you but for me it was always like get to the end it's like I wanna um I don't want to quit I don't want to quit I want to get there but like I would start rushing and when you rush your form changes and when you rush you don't actually have that time under tension that actually look at you wow time under attention yeah classic classic muscle building words I like it don't make me say glycogen so so he's like um he's like those last four reps you're trying to get them done but that's where all the all the games are in that that last bit and he's like that's where I want you to show Poise slow and actually slow it down like don't just like do normal speed go even slower than your your normal Pace was to maximize what you get out of it and so then that became it's like okay when you feel that Sizzle when you feel that burn that's the reaction is not panic and Rush it's Poise so I took that I was like okay that's the lesson in the gym but the gym is just a metaphor for life so now I'm doing that same thing everywhere as soon as I feel that Sizzle and that burn and I just want to get out of there I want to get done with it I'm like no no Now's the Time to be poisoned and slow it down and so that's been working wonders in the business world because it's like just when everybody thinks shit's hitting the fan I'm like all right this is the time where we where we where we go poised we lock in and we calmly address the situation versus trying to react overreact and react to a to a stimulus this my friend is called growth Sean you are experiencing growth congratulations you're doing it right in front of all of our eyes and in our ears you're showing growth what topic you want to do next we're in a weird middle terminal yeah let's do um do you have anything little let me see if I got something little by the way while you're looking you have to tell me what to do for my researcher now I have 400 applicants I've narrowed it down to 200 and I'm like I don't know what to do with these people you have to tell me how to like you should just tell them to do basically just give them the assignment which is uh I'll tell you what to do okay I'll tell you how to do this okay so the what I would do is the best way to work together best way to know if you want to work with them is to just do a project rather than interview them you don't want to interview 400 or even 20 people that would just take up way too much time so you give them all the assignment the assignment is hey every week um here's the things that we do I want you to surface interesting nuggets that I might find interesting I did that all 400 people did that dude okay so who are the best 25 from that and did you do it for like two or three like have them do it for like two weeks be like uh you know hey do this for two weeks if you do it I'm gonna pay you you know I'll pay you 250 bucks if you get through all the all the things that might be a lot of money I don't know do the math but like do something so they're not working totally for free um or cut the bottom like 200 people right away and then just be like hey do this because because I think it's easy to do once and it's really hard to do for three weeks straight A lot of people could do a great MFM podcast once I don't know how many of them could do this podcast 100 times 100 episodes a year and that's what we do and so you kind of need a researcher who's able to who has some inflow of information that that they can steadily be curating good stuff and then the second thing is give them a couple of research topics so be like uh the way I do it is sometimes I give them an assignment to bring me interesting nuggets but then I bring nuggets and I say hey take this story and uh I want you to research here's what I want and I basically gave them a format so my format for them is you want I want you to come up with the frame so the frame is the the framing of the topic how will I just bring this up out of the blue on MFM right so let's say there's some interesting growth hack uh the frame might be you know here's three of my favorite growth hacks that I've seen in the past year right because just talking about this one randomly doesn't work or let's say it's a growth hack but actually um or let me give the example the Nugget was um I bought a car from an anonymous account on Twitter so that's a cool frame that's like a hook for a good story but we changed it to the guy Mafia so I bought it from car dealership guy but you know what there are all these guys and actually maybe there's a bigger topic here that's called the guy Mafia and people like that that frame right so I teach them I'm like you gotta hit me with a possible frame then you got to have the supporting like evidence like what are the four or five interesting bullet points talking points that I could say about this thing that would make you say oh that's cool that's interesting and then what's the take or the takeaway and the take of the takeaway and let's say for the guy Mafia was it was first it was here's why this works but then I was like no no a better take would be here's what I think people should be doing you should be doing this with a girl Anonymous account because I think it'll get more followers you should be doing it in all these other categories and then don't monetize with a newsletter or paid paid Community monetize by selling the actual thing like selling me the car and so that was the take and so I I tease on like here's a little Excel table and for every story you got to fill out the frame the talking points and the take and um I see it yeah I'm good at that most people by the way are very bad at that that's okay I'm like our skill is we need to be able to do that but them doing it poorly is still super helpful because you're like no no that's a shitty frame the frame's got to be this and that's still better than a blank page I need you to send me all this yeah I will yeah I need I need help with this it's been very challenging yeah these are the these are the tricks of the trade that other people we're giving these out for free now I remember once remember the the TV show um the P Diddy one where he's trying to find a rapper yeah and he's like I need you to go to Brooklyn and give me some milk and you like make them walk across the bridge you know what I'm talking about like makes him walk across to get a bucket cupcake like five miles because that's how he started his career he was a runner yeah a record label and he had to go get [ __ ] um but he had this thing where he was in the studio and he's like he's like uh sing it and then they they sang it he's like uh sing it again they're like wow it wasn't that good he goes no we need to make a double what's a double he's like a double as you say the same exact thing and we layer the two audio tracks and makes your voice sound more full and powerful and it just sounds better and he turned to the camera he's like I shouldn't be saying all this [ __ ] on camera and uh and I remember literally like I was in seventh grade when that show came out and I was like I just heard a trick at the train and I've never forgot that even though I'm not a rapper I never used it but literally I was like make space in the brain he just kind of made it sound like he just gave me an Insider tactic and I literally like still remember this now I'm 34 years old and I still remember this that's hilarious that's hilarious I just heard it that's good um all right let's get out of here [Music]

okay next one um uh hosted buyer meetings on a plane B2B decision makers get a free vacation if they agree to have X number of conversations on a flight it's like the time share idea it's like so you get a free flight uh but it's you're going to get on a plane a full of vendors it's like that movie Snakes on a Plane instead of snakes it's just B2B software vendors just waiting to just barrage you for for the next s hours on your way to Maui [Music] so here's I'm going to tell you about something that's interesting there's a guy who I love and his name's Anan do you uh he started CB insights do you know him yeah listens to the Pod love the guy yeah he's a great guy he's one of my good friends and I was thinking about this so there's a lot of things that second time or third time entrepreneurs think about that mostly firsttime entrepreneurs don't think about one of them being distribution so they'll think like oh I'm just going to make a cool product and it'll somehow get into people's hands that's false you got to have marketing baked in or like it's got to be part of like the ideation phase marketing the second thing is pricing uh they think oh I'll just charge $5 a month and I'll get like millions of people to buy this and then you actually start doing it and you're like wow this is incredibly challenging to get thousands or tens of thousands let alone millions of people to buy something that's really hard and so I've been thinking about that pricing thing so things that fit my wants and my needs and my skill sets so for example content there's industry dive which probably only has five or 10 million ion people a month reading their website but they make [ __ ] for like people who own grocery stores like content for people who own grocery stores versus BuzzFeed which makes stuff for stat home moms who like cat videos BuzzFeed worth 100 million Industry Drive does the exact same thing way smaller audience makes or uh sold recently for 500 or $600 million so like I've been thinking about like those that price like that that different ways of packaging and so aan from CB insights he's got this company that's brand new it's only 90 days old it's been way lowkey and under under wraps and I recently discovered it and I asked him so it's called yard stick so go to yards stick.com and tell me what you see it's called yardstick so it's the word yard like a backyard and it stick is s tiq he's getting a little cute on us uh let's see okay so yard stick powered by CV insights learn what software buyers really think about their vendors great title great headline yeah um and then it says access thousands of analysts LED conversations with software buyers to quickly understand pricing competition evaluation criteria and subscription and satisfaction so basically they interview software buyers and they get the scoop on how do you really feel about X tool and then they summarize it so that you can you can see how other people think about this tool before you buy it exactly that's it and they charge like something like 30 or they charge yeah it's really smart and I'll explain how this works but they charge like 30 or $40,000 a year for this and I think this could be $100 million a year business and they're just I'm I'm downplaying but right now the MVP is just interviewing people and showing transcripts eventually I'm sure this is really smart I remember you talked about this back in the day because there's that website what is it G2 crowd yes exactly and um there's basically like software is a massive category and people are like oh which CRM should I use and it's like oh you know it's HubSpot fighting with 10 other people to try to be the answer to that question and so reviews is always this thing that people are trying to like I think people in general want the a of a review but it's hard to trust reviews nowadays you don't know if the reviews are faked uh you don't know if they're from people like you who have the same problems as you uh and the website like you know G2 crowd and these other ones they're pretty bad and I've seen a I've seen several people try to create a new software review site to compete with them and they have to do two things one they have to actually be better at the reviews and two they have to rank higher in SEO for when somebody searches for you know whatever xtool alternative or what's the best which know sales tool for me to use and it's really hard to beat their SEO and so they're fighting a very uphill battle this I think is smart for two reasons one they already have a bunch of customers that they could just sell this sell into with this two the idea of instead of saying okay well whoever reviews it hopefully they're good reviews they're like no we're just going to hire people to do these conversations and like the math works out if we get these Brands to say what they think about these tools you know we might only need to invest I don't know $200,000 into the to collection of that data and that gives us like like a better review a better um content system and what you've nailed everything and there's a third thing though which is basically G2 or um softwar reviews.com or a lot of these websites the way they typically work is they give an affiliate fee or some type of like advertisement fee they they collect that from the brand who wants to advertise on the website which means they have to go and get traffic and they've got to convince Brands to give money whereas this business yard stick it does exactly what I said before it changes the way they package it and so they just go no you're the customer you're going to read this and you're going to get value from this you're giving us 30 grand a year and so we're just going to make [ __ ] for you and it's just that's our that's our that's our exchange and so that's what we're going to do and so basically the background behind this business is uh this is something that I didn't know about until recently and probably you didn't either because we both had small companies and so a small company in this definition is anything that's below a billion dollars in in market cap or value meaning typically the people who buy this [ __ ] have 500 employees and the reason that's important is when you buy a software provider or you buy a CRM or you buy like some type of um what's it called where you uh like uh your customer like you do give customer feedback like or you uh like interact with your customers and your customer service agents use it doing business I don't know customer happiness I don't you know whatever like the software is like a zenes or something like that so but like picking the wrong software if you are a 500% company it will cost you like so much money and so you have to do actually a fair amount of research including like who invested in this company so I know they're not even going to go out of business and I never even a million years thought about that I'm like dude I'm just going to Google like what's better Gusto or zenefits and like we'll just pick one and then we'll switch if it sucks and so what yard stick is doing is they actually have just it's Anan and seven other employees are the early people starting this company and they basically just ask like seven questions to people who have bought software uh in the last two years and they say like who else did you consider who'd you pick what price did you pay would you renew what's your customer satisfaction and then um the people who purchased this yardstick product are either investment bankers so people who are like making investment decisions in the public markets or or private markets and they want to know what the customer satisfaction is or people who are going out and buying software and they could see these other reviews and it's just like a really interesting business because there's there's a company's like GLG you know GLG it's like uh you get paid two grand an hour GG calls back in the day yeah you get paid two grand an hour to like answer questions but that's one to one and so what they're saying is like no we're not going to do one to one but we'll just make it so you can just read like dozens and dozens of interviews so anyway interesting company for all everything I said but secondly it's an interesting company because this business is only 90 days old and I think if you go and sign up for their email list now it's kind of like you can watch like a big business being built in re real time yeah this is really good like I'm jealous I didn't think of this idea um I kind of wish he had just done this outside of CB insights I feel like this could have been his next hit I think it's going to be as big as CB insights so I think there's uh slight you know although it's good to be able to sell into those same customers I think it would have been worth it to uh you know spin this out but you know that's a that's a com more complicated decision by the way this guy Anan he has a giant list of startup ideas have you seen this no where I'm trying to find the list I remember seeing it on um Twitter one day but uh here well why look for a second but the background behind a naan is he started CB insights they're close to 100 million in Revenue he's kind of a [ __ ] in a really good way for example he signs he he writes their daily newsletter and he signs the newsletter with I love you or in his Twitter file it profile it says please sign up for CB insights I owe people money and like he is like like kind of like a cheeky like mischievous guy and very very likable and that's and his content amazing and so that's a n's really interesting if you if you want to know what speaks to our heart you got to be somebody who's trying to do something so you got to be ambitious or successful in some way and the second thing is a little bit of a [ __ ] so you know like have that I don't like to eat my wings without sauce you got to have a little dipping sauce to your personality if you're going to if you're going to get me on board and he's got the sauce all right so let me tell you some of these ideas so I don't have the full list I remember seeing this like a year ago go or something like that um we should get them on the Pod but let me just read a couple of the ideas that were tweeted out from this list okay so first one tough mutter for kids so here's what he says really any sort of manufactured adversity for semi afluent or affluent kids parents talk about wanting their kids to have perspective resilience and reduce their entitlement and get them off screens um tough mutter for kids super high margin unsure if uh you know unsure exactly how it work but money to be made for sure okay dude Spartan Spartan races now Spartan races I'm I'm signing up for one they actually have a kids version right now tiny Spartans I don't know if this how it's called but you know we can pretend um that's good name startup idea du lingo for teaching Finance or accounting teach the principles of accounting or Finance via gamified dual lingo Style app what do you give that one uh yeah that's cool okay next one um uh hosted buyer meetings on a plane B2B decision makers get a free vacation if they agree to have X number of conversations on a flight it's like the time share idea it's like so you get a free flight uh but it's you're going to get on a plane of full of vendors it's like that movie Snakes on a Plane instead of snakes it's just be be software vendors just waiting to just barrage you for for the next seven hours on your way to Maui and just tons of coke and and just everything that like a 45-year-old guy named Todd who wears tight blue jeans and brown shoes whatever they need like yeah this is Jennifer she wants you to call her Jenny and she happens to like you yeah I think it's actually uh I think you actually could build a business that way if I'm if you sign up for a free trial you get to go to First Class that'd be great uh yeah this is actually kind of a genius idea okay here here we go buyable Google doc travel itineraries so friends often share their travel plans via Google Docs you know here's what I did in Iceland um since they're friends I chest your judgment um you know the idea would be let me just buy the whole it tenery with a buy now button my vacation plan is done awesome quick reaction okay um that's a small business but cool win loss reporting for employee hiring and attrition so when somebody doesn't accept your job offer the service would would dig in and find out the real reasons why when somebody leaves the service digs in and finds the real reason why it would maybe anonymize or synthesize the insights over time today the process is very ad hoc that's a great idea that's a great idea that is a really good idea uh wow that's that's a solid one okay uh here's a not so solid one but more fun the Nike of baby diapers so create high performance premium diapers use sodium polyacrylate to make them super absorbent like astronaut diapers other Tech to increase Comfort make clean up easier why because parents spend a stupid amount of money on their kids okay dude anytime anytime you say it's a Nike of something it's like when I see a restaurant on the side of road says world's greatest coffee or like the best pie in town I automatically buy it that's that's my rule if it says it's the world's greatest if you're just bold enough to think that I I'm going to try it I'm in dude I had the same realization yesterday where I was listening to some talk where Johnny IV was talking and um and I KN I knew somebody who met Johnny IV like used to hang out with Johnny IV regularly they like live near each other in San Francisco and I was like oh what's Johnny IV like for those who don't know he's basically the the head designer at Apple for like all the great products iPod you know whatever Macintosh uh you iPhone all that good stuff so this guy's like the basically the greatest product designer in the world he's the guy Steve Jobs trusted the most at Apple I was like what's he like and they're like oh you know he's kind of like you would expect he's like you know he's he's got a sort of a dry but but funny personality he's a he's a pretty focused individual like he's not like effing around a whole lot um you know he works really hard and um they'd be like yeah they'd come to me they' be like yeah Johnny had an idea and I was like oh my God what's this Johnny I idea now I don't remember the specifics this was like eight years ago but they just said that for every idea but it'd be like a closet that's beautifully designed what does that mean and then I realized I started using this I'd be like you know what you guys should do like I was giving somebody advice other day I was like you know in your when you guys is Ecom brand I was like when you send your package you should put in there just like beautiful pamphlet just like super well done that just will make somebody they'll read it they'll know your story but just just a beautiful pamphlet and and I realized I was like wow if you just say like a beautiful thing a beautiful and then just like generic thing and say just super well done the idea goes from like a whatever idea to like that's a great idea yeah I could see that it's when and honestly it's not totally BS there is something to it if you said like you know let's just make like a really like just a hilarious YouTube video it's like actually that is the correct strategy you know but there's not much more to it it's just a question can you can you do something that's actually beautiful or really well done or really funny but honestly that's not a bad business plan for most things to just say just a beautifully done just all the details nailed it's like when Andrew Wilkinson Andrew Wilkinson says we try to buy wonderful companies right and like our beautiful businesses we want to buy beautiful businesses job board yeah like wonderful you're right that is it's wonderful he's like okay we're gonna bake this cookie but it's just gonna melt in your mouth and you're like okay all right all right I'm in it's like you know otherwise it's just a cookie and so I think there's something to this but um all right I'm going to keep going by the way I feel like I'm reading this guy's diary and just you know I feel feel wrong just taking all these startup ideas here so rapid fire this could be like 12 episodes of content for us but I'm going to don't read it let's just steal it well I know but I'm like I want to just use them all now want to binge eat this whole like tub of ice cream right here let me give you a couple more um happy cam a highlight reel of the best moments of your life how a wearable camera that records audio and video only when you're laughing it captures the conversation of who you're with and great moments all right fictitious even the great ones going a Miss once in a while yeah just to show a little balance here yeah um okay how about let me pull up another one okay how about this um he also wrote bad startup ideas I think so bad but sexy so startup ideas that suck you in but they're actually bad startup ideas here we go yeah personal CRM always a bad one preach into the choir yeah curated news recommendations well in most cases it's bad but hey look that's what you me we got to get that one um it's something going to be like a college campus like Craigslist and then like laundry on like uh delivery laundry here's one what are my friends up to right now apps these apps promise you hey what if your friend was two blocks away you didn't know this with this app you could have met up with them no wrong dude by the way did you know that girls share their location on their iPhone with other girls like my wife does this with her friends did you know people do that safety purposes I don't know why they do that but like I was out with like my wife and a bunch of her friends and they all did the same thing with themselves like that group of friends and other people like they know their where their real time location is at all times hold on why honey why you going to the car my friend's going to the restroom and she wanted somebody to go with her I'm driving to meet up with her dude it's crazy they I don't even know how to use that feature where I don't even know where that feature is on a phone I don't know you click a thing and it says like share location for an hour or share indefinitely yeah seems like a trap uh not going to happen to-do list software yep that's one classic stup idea that everybody does um glass door for VCS a website that RS VCS nobody really cares very much about re VCS they're infrequent decisions for most entrepreneurs they'll take money from who they can get yeah um in most cases Founders are lucky enough to have a good choice they probably already know who's good okay so those are some of his bad bad startup ideas but he's got a bunch here I'm not gonna we should have him on the guy is interesting he's pretty fun he's earned his he's earned his spot for sure I forgot to remind you these last few times you being The Listener about our gentleman's agreement so like uh have you ever yes uh there's like have you ever gone to 7-Eleven and you've seen like uh like an Alzheimer's or like a sick children's like bowl and you like leave a quarter and you take a piece of candy right so that that whole thing works and they use this thing called an honor System a gentleman's agreement where you put down a quarter and you take a piece of candy and it's just it just works that's kind of what our podcast is like a little bit with subscribing to our YouTube channel so Sean and I spend all this time we talk about about stuff constantly about what we're going to do on the Pod I live an epic life actually just so I can talk about it on the Pod I dedicate my life to this and all I want in exchange is not even a quarter it's just for you to click subscribe on YouTube so if you're listening to this on iTunes or Spotify whatever just go to your YouTube and just click subscribe that's all we want because that helps the algorithm we get a little bit higher and we'll just it helps our ego I mean that's really all today if you're making the choice between Alzheimer's children and us make the right choice choose us yeah it's free 60% of our YouTube views come from people who don't subscribe and all I can ask them is are you not entertained do you not want more of this click subscribe all right so that's that uh Gentleman's Agreement reinforced and everyone's been doing it lately so if you don't do it you're gonna you'll look silly so I think you should do it um all right okay I want to talk about a different little Trend that I've seen on Twitter and I call this the guy Mafia I saw that line I thought that was really funny I mean I would have called the guy Mafia just the mafia but the guy Mafia well so what what am I what am I calling the guy Mafia you've probably seen this trend I feel like it's kind of new but it's basically a whole bunch of Twitter accounts that are branded like car dealership Guy mobile home park guy strip mall guy Self Storage guy right there's like and they're basically just saying it's an anonymous account so you don't know who's behind it the promise is basically hey I'm in I've been in this this this space for a while I got you know I've been doing this for 10 20 years I will share insights but also kind of like industry secrets about the way our industry works the you know the the the dirty laundry and um these accounts are blowing up they get really big really fast I just bought a car from car dealership guy did you really I know who this guy is I just yeah I just dropped dude I almost bought a car from him too I almost bought a car from too tell people who he is well no I don't want to say his his identity he did he did eventually tell me his identity but I know who he is too so he's cardip guy on Twitter he basically he's always just twe tweeting out about like you know insights into the car market right which I like following right because I want to know about the car market without doing any work so here one he just tweeted he said the market is literally flooded with Buick they're rotting on car lots like trash you could score a deal on these if you're willing to suffer the embarrassment of being seen in one Buick are on 100 Buick are at 121 day supply for context toy Toyota is less than 30day Supply ridiculous the simple people terms day supply means the number of days it would take to deplete the current new car inventory at the current rate of sales and so immediately I went let's go look at a Buick yeah these guys are very influential I'm telling you I spent a lot of money on a car through through this guy that I never saw so what he's doing with his like cont service which so okay let me give you the the full idea then then I'll break it down but here's we'll use him as an example so he creates the car dealership guy and I don't think he's been at it for very long so uh let pull up kind of the the December 21 so December 21 so that's one year basically he added 93,000 followers in the last 30 days oh my God he's at 225,000 now literally when we wrote this thing like you know two days ago we did the research Rel this he was at 219 so like two days he added 6,000 followers this guy's blowing up um and what he's doing he's tweeting out insights like okay you know here's what the used car prices are doing here's what the market is here's Which models and makes or are hottest right now here's why G wagons are selling for this and here's where I think that's going here's what's happening with auto loans and here's what that means for the industry all that good stuff okay so he he gets the following because he's tweeting out interesting stuff secondly he then says okay well what do I do with this what do I create a a newsletter paid Community you know people are like the samon Sean Playbook you know they open up their like red red book and they're like is this what I want to do but actually he got some good advice from a buddy of mine who said screw that don't don't make a newsletter and then try to find ads sponsors are paid he goes just help people buy cars they building up a load of Trust on Twitter people will buy cars from you in fact go buy me a car so my buddy is like I want to buy a Toyota Sequoia and I think there's like Toyota sequ he was telling me he's like some crazy things where it hasn't been updated in like 15 or 18 years or something like that like the last update was like in 2004 or some [ __ ] like that and there's like a 100,000 person waiting list for the Toyota seoa some like crazy number like that and he's like yeah but I bet there's got to be one somewhere in the country you know what I'll get for I'll buy in any color any goofy color and this guy because car dealership guy is a has a background as a dealer he can at least we think access the car dealership the car dealer Network so basically they can buy cars they have like their own little MLS system right so they can buy cars out of auction uh and what that's how dealers acquire cars and then they can sell those cars at a retail market and so what he's doing is he's just buying cars out of the auction not really applying the retail markup and just charging a flat fee as a concierge for purchasing the vehicle which we talked about before we talked about negotiating a uh negotiating car price as a service from a guy who like knows the In-N-Outs of car dealerships and he knows the time of month who to talk to what to say things like that this is like that but more in depth and so I told the guy I was like hey um I want an escalate and he's like you want to escalate I said I wanted to escalate by the way hilarious thing I go I was like you know let me just I was like I'm not going to go test drive these cars nothing so I was like let me just go read the reviews online real quick but if you search for like reviews you get these like it's like dude is this just like some SEO optimized website so I go Reddit let me go to Reddit and see what people are saying let me tell you how people on Reddit feel about cardal the same way that people in prison feel about pedophiles like people on Reddit do not like Escalades they are like dude I've never met a non jerk in an Escalade right like Escalade start smoking cigars drug dealers and Desperate Housewives and then I was like Hey guys category number three Indian podcasters here we go and so wait are you getting the hybrid one or the electric one or something like that no no no you got to go full on you know they have great self-driving technology I actually looked at one too I didn't do that much research to be honest with you but um just got the the big one so the the extended version so anyways the my point is a lot of trust anyways bought a car with this guy so dude you live in the suburbs of San Francisco and you drive an Escalade you are warping into something I don't know exactly what it is but there's definitely a stereotype that you are fitting into you're like the Tony Soprano of Danville [Laughter] I can't believe that let me tell you some of these other guys so we have strip mall guy who you know he's basically bu like little strip malls or like I don't know I don't know what you would call it like these little like b-class shopping centers uh there's the W uh franchise wolf franchise wolf is a guy who talks about buying franchises and what franchise are doing oh crumble cookie exploding like crazy here's what's going on with that franchise that's a great that's a great Niche to be in because interested franchise buyers are are super super valuable that's that customer a lead who's interested in buying a franchise is worth tens of thousand dollars to these uh companies um secret CFO another great name didn't go with the guy but I like secret CFO so I like franchise wolf I like secret CFO these are great names great Brands and I think they work for a couple reasons number one what about um the the watch guy I talked to him I almost bought a watch from him he just post didn't even know about him yeah there's a it's a he's it's a watch guy it's called um I think just watch guy actually I see a new one like every day right now and by the way this whole is going to get flooded it's already getting flooded CU people see it now that we're talking about it and breaking it down everybody who's like I am a dental hygienist dental hygienist guy you know like there's going to be like just like a ton of these coming out but honestly and they all use cartoons as their Avatar by the way I sent you in the Riverside chat the luxury watch guy and he does the exact same thing he goes here's what I'm seeing this uh Rolex retails for 20,000 it's an eight-month weight and so therefore what we're actually seeing is people are buying it for 35,000 or this month mostly because of the crypto guys this particular uh model of Rolex is going way down because they're selling it because they need to afford rent and by the way if anybody wants to do the the nft guy uh you know for for for crypto uh you know we'll hire you for the bill card we'll pay you to build this account um if you're good so so so basically this is the trend okay so why do I think this works number one the the value proposition is in the name you don't even need to click to the bio they're a walking billboard for what value they're going to provide to you what what they're going to teach you about I think that sets them apart from just like oh this is Steve uh you know Steve Irwin you you know you don't know that he's the nature guy right like you don't know that you have to there's still a leap of faith you have to click in read the bio then you get the then you understand the value here it's right on top second thing they promise basically data insights in Industry secrets and people really like industry secrets and so you can go viral with some of these like here's the dirty little secrets about buying a used car or buy go about what happens when you walk into a car dealership I sat in these rooms for 30 years I know what conversations the B the seller is having when you walk in like a fish and it's like I got to click this I got to read this and at the end of it I'm going to trust them as a niche expert um so I think those are the two kind of like core reasons that it works it's also just a focused feed so versus my account sometimes you're going to hear me talk about sports I'm going to crack a joke I'm going to complain about my kids and sometimes I'm going to Tweet Tech stuff and in reality people just kind of want you for one of those things at at upfront upfront a focused feed is going to do better so I think that's why these are these are working and um and I think all of these people who do this are going to make at least low millions of dollars and a few of them who really learned how to capitalize capitalize on this are will make tens of Millions millions of dollars of a business that basically the core of their business is just this Twitter account where they are the um you know the gas station guy like I saw one yesterday it was mobile home park guy tweeted one interesting thing about mobile home I insta followed I have no real desire to buy a mobile home park but I kind of want to know about it be smarter about it and then turns out the guy DMS me it's my friend I'm like you you do this and he's like yeah I was like what the hell's going on here and so you know you never know what's going on under the video it's your dad your dad's doing this side hustle I uh I think this is a really really good Insight that you've had um and I completely agree I think someone like a the car guy I think could make tens of millions of dollars um now let me give you now let me give you the so what would I do about this let me add to it right so by the way another good thing about this you can have ghost riders or contributors because you're just under this Anonymous umbrella brand um so that's another benefit here um okay so what can you do with it so first I think avoid the you know let me do shout outs let me do paid ads in a free newsletter let me do a community like if somebody says the word Community you should stiff arm them in in this if you're doing these you got like you want to do it where you actually get towards the transaction uh maybe a high ticket course can work but like I I do think you want to be more like the car dealership guy who's actually doing this or you want to be the strip mall guy and you want to raise a giant fund off well dude have you asked why cuz I'm the same way I would I almost sold my car recently and I had him give me a quote on it to tell me how much they're selling for and then I go oh I and I made a $100,000 plus decision because h of his advice have you asked yourself why did we trust just these guys like they don't even they use a cartoon it's the same reason people trust us from this podcast or from Twitter which is that I think when you get to see somebody think out loud which is what writing is or or talking on a podcast um and they're not talking to you you're overhearing them and they're not selling you anything they're just giving give give give give give right this the Gary ve Playbook right the jab jab jab Hook is give give give ask and so that's what they're doing right now they're just in give mode and I think that's the absolute right way to be give give give give give insights insights insights and then there's a surprising number of wealthy people who will say hey can you help me I want to do this I want to buy one of these or I want to get your opinion on this and they will come to you hat in hand like me and you did to these suckers like suckers to these guys okay so that's the first thing um secondly I think that I would get away I called it the guy Mafia but I'm calling it right here it's time to start the gal Mafia we need we need car dealership lady we need strip strip club Queen we need we need the female version MLM Queen yeah exactly we need the uh it's called uh network marketing or some [ __ ] like that by the way that's how that it's like when you meet somebody who's proud of being in an MLM you're like wait you know you're in MLM they're like yeah I'm a I'm a I'm great at Network sales what the [ __ ] is Network sales if you can say the word I have a downline like if those words have come out of your mouth like yeah yeah yeah you're a pimp that's what the that's what the that's what the Twitter profile should be like does does the wear downline make you weak at the knees if yes you're at the right place my friend right if I presented you the shapes circle square and triangle and you immediately gravitate towards triangle it's like those like pych tests the RO test whatever um okay so I think you should brand it as a woman whether you're a guy or a girl to be honest with you um I think you know catfish away go I think I think that's the first opportunity um second you got to go find all all the valuable niches so luxury watch sneakers cars gas stations real State I mean what else there's franchises there's dude but are women using Twitter I surveyed my audience and I go select if you're a male or a female and it was it was 93% male it was all dudes it was probably all dudes looking for a father figure like it was all young men are are are like have you when me and sahill did the Meetup it was like uh literally 100 to one men to women it was crazy if you're a single woman you got to come to our meetups you will love it um do you have any women followers you think like it's or is all Twitter this way no I think it's more us than it is all of Twitter I think Twitter probably skewed but not to the 90% uh that's a that's kind of a crazy ratio there but okay by the way so here's here's my crazier ideas okay so first of all I think Twitter's the wrong place to do this uh I think it works on Twitter for sure but I also think LinkedIn I think that there are other networks where you should probably be able to do well with this um I don't know if LinkedIn like Anonymous accounts or like fake names maybe it doesn't but the second thing is honestly I think there could be a whole social network that's basically just yo you join here and there's just verified like people who are industry insiders that you get to read their content from and and and subscribe and follow them I think you can literally like it is not likely to work but it's more likely than a lot of stupid social app ideas uh because it has really clear value prop so anyways that's my like long shot idea around this yeah I think this is a really really good Insight that you've had and I completely agree that there's a massive opportunity here I tried to make the argument this Summer that there's going to be a billion- Dollar Empire started on Twitter just like there has been on YouTube and all these other things and I think one of these people it wouldn't it's not out of this world that one of these folks could be that person another thing that I've noticed on Twitter and um I didn't entirely plan this but because you brought up I'll bring it up have you noticed um people doing Affiliates for agencies so basically um who a question that you and I probably get asked a lot is like who's a good accountant accounting firm or who's a good growth marketer for newsletters or uh you know there's like eight questions that you and I get asked all the time um and I did this with my body tutor so my body tutor they were like hey do you just want to like earn money every person you send to us CU you're already sending tons of people I go hell yeah give me a link tweeting a bunch of like uh a bunch of shout outs I was like are you getting uh Kickbacks here what's going on I feel like you've tweeted a couple of these I haven't I just started doing it for my body tutor because they're like dude you sent us so much like we'll just give you some money if you want but no I've I've not uh who have I tweeted out lately I just I just call out cool [ __ ] it was them and it was one other one that I saw that I was like uh Jason it it was your um Diego video yeah yeah no no I no I just like I'm just like [ __ ] it dude youve done well what I told him was I go hey if you're good for for you right I go do it for free for me and if you're good I'll tell people about you and so I made them do it for free for me for 6 months and so and so I was just like I'll just share with you but then you and I have friends and I've SE people do this and I think they're making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year by referring people to certain agencies and the right way to do this is to find a product or a service that you're already a fan of and ask for an affiliate or go and start the thing with someone and just be an affiliate and uh I think that there's like this world we had Neil Patel on the Pod and he basically founded an agency and the reason why he was considered the founder was he did start it but he wasn't running it but a lot of the early leads and probably a lot of the leads to this day came from Neil patel.com because people were using his website to search like SEO stuff and we haven't seen people do that on Twitter but it's actually is really good because Twitter unlike the other social media platforms is ideal for link clicks and that makes it really easy to attribute growth and I think that there's a lot of people making a significant amount of money referring people to these high ticket products and I think we can continue to see that and it might be a lot pretty quite quite big I've thought about doing this so one thing I've been thinking about doing is post milk Road okay we sold the milk Ro got some time what do I want to do next I kind of want to focus on the Pod make the Pod bigger uh better all that all that good stuff one of the ways I think but the Pod you know the Pod itself is free if you're listening to this right now you've paid me you know 0.0 so how does this ever you know become something that that you could justify saying I'm not going to go build another business I'm going to do this inad and one way is that can the Pod basically provide some kind of win-win value for people and so this one thing I was thinking about was like I kind of want to buy a bunch of businesses that like of people that I've worked with like either you know like go to my accountant or go to my lawyer or go to my estate planner and basically buy the a majority stake in their firm and in exchange be like cool there are a lot of other Founders like me who also want estate planning who also want legal help who also want trade Markel who also want accounting and basically just build a MFM style like back office um set of businesses and instead of an affiliate like actually own them make sure that they're they're great like trust in them and um and then drive a bunch of value to the to those businesses and then in return there's a bunch of people Founders like me who are constantly asking for recommendations about like yo I'm trying to find a good blank and I've burned through seven accountants before I found one I like same thing on the planning site same thing and so it's like no not everybody should have to redo that work and so that's one thought I've had as to like a cool business to build that just kind of helps kind of founder entrepreneur you know types um and yeah just like own those own own a collection of those businesses that and then uh you know have audience you know people in this audience who want that want those same Services be able to just go find who we use yeah and the the cons are like can you possibly vet the right people and have like actually quality but the pros are like this is pretty much what R Richard Branson did with Virgin and so it's definitely possible I often wonder why like more celebrities like the Kardashians and stuff like why don't they own an equity stake in more things than they do it doesn't seem like they do for a lot they have done for one or two things that ended up being quite big and so I wonder like what's the strategy like where where's where does CU every celebrity has thought about this too and so I think like well where's the down where's the where's the focus like you know how much how many if you're going to take Equity Stakes you know how much how many things can you promote and how many things can you you know you're better off basically in in those cases like you're better off finding the one or two product categories that you can own a large chunk of and go big right this is like skims for for Kim Kardashian this is Kylie's lip stuff this is Conor McGregor's whiskey Irish whiskey it's like you know he took the Irish whiskey thing was like I'm just going to put this on blast I'm going to own a chunk of this I'm going to put this on blast I think they sold it for 500 600 million um within three years something like that so you know that was like worth a lot more than like affiliate linking out to 20 services or trying to own tiny chunks of 20 businesses and then have to use your clout to promote 20 different businesses that's kind of exhausting so I think that's why you want to do a different topic yeah I um well let me brain or do you want to go to is your pain for really good both of my things here I think are pretty good but I can save them cuz to the end go go go go all which one do you want painfotainment yes or the katana store the katana store is a horrible name so what is that actually oh I've seen this is this the guy who keeps tweeting about his YouTube page yes yes I thought that was beautiful and I kept I'm like wait Katana is this a joke like you literally just sell swords yeah exactly okay so I see this guy I've been I've been seen this guy for a while now and so he sells I think his website's called mini Katana docomo what's a Tech Deck I don't know what that is you remember the mini finger skateboards oh no no it's not that fa it's like you know like 2 feet in length instead of like a full samurai sword is like you know 5et or whatever uh this is this is uh you know like half the size of a normal thing maybe you know 2 feet instead of four I didn't know this I didn't know the standard size of a katana if I'm yeah I realized I said that and like you know the katana guy is going to come after me here and that's not who you want on your bad side all right so if you go to this website you'll see that it does about 1 to two million monthly visits which is a lot that is a lot of traffic for an Ecom store uh I he tweets about their revenue sometimes wow the website is actually awesome it's like the Supreme of like swords yeah actually that's a good that's a good thing so I think this business does it does at eight figures it does at least 10 million a year in Revenue I think it's closer to 20 um so I think it's probably closer to 20 based on the traffic and one of the main ways that they do it is through YouTube okay so really there's two kind of like hardcore takeaways that I have out of this so this I'm calling my um I'm calling this my new Theory my updated theory on what it takes to have a great Ecom brand by the these are dope I'm I'm going to buy me a [ __ ] sword these are sick yeah you went from making fun of this to add to in like 6 seconds okay so yeah I'm going to buy me a gold sword who doesn't I call this The Stranger Things law which is basically if you want to make it an Ecom one of the things you got to do is find people who are strangely and unapologetically obsessed with a certain lifestyle and then you just need to sell them things so uh so you know that's that's the whole model right so here's an example Katana store right so it's like you have this people you have people who are just obsessed with Japanese culture for some reason and they're always you'll never find an Indian guy who loves Japanese culture right like you're finding white people who are super into Japanese culture not Japanese people and and so you're like um and and there's people who are really into something that's kind of irrational and I remember meet one time I met this guy who was the first product guy first product manager at Twitter he joined when Twitter was maybe like 10 15 people uh total and I was like I remember talking to him and I was like so was it obvious at that time Twitter was going to be huge he goes no no no like Twitter was it was like basically nothing at the time it was very small it was just kind of this thing that tech people were doing but even the tech people who were using it kind of felt like well this is stupid right like we're all just text messaging what we're like what we're having for lunch right now like that doesn't seem like the next big thing and he goes but luckily I had learned a very valuable lesson which is Anytime You observe a weird Behavior people doing a phenomenon where people are in Mass just doing this thing that makes no sense I first your first reaction is say that's weird and you kind of Judge it he goes but I've learned you got to lean into that phenomenon if people are doing people playing video games there's a reason exactly this reminded me of my experience when I was in college I remember freshman year of college I walk into my buddy toi's dorm room and I was like uh I see him playing video games and he's got his back to me he's playing uh I don't know Starcraft at the time I think and then I'm like yo Toof and then he turns around and I'm like oh sorry I didn't like I didn't real you're in a game and cuz he took off his headphones he turned around and I noticed that the game is like still going and he's not he's not touching the mouse anymore and I was like what are you wait what are you doing what are you just like in like a demo mode what is this he goes oh no I'm not playing I'm watching you're watch this is 2010 I'm like 200 uh no 2007 or something like that 2008 and um I'm like you're watching somebody play video games and he goes yeah I I always do this I'm like you woke up I was like it's 8:30 in the morning you woke woke up at 8:30 in the morning and started watching somebody play Starcraft why don't you just play he's like no this is this is like one of the best players I just want to watch him and I was like nerd was like I was like hold on let me go get four friends so we can make fun of you together because this is not going to be fun alone and I literally went I got grabbed my roommate I was like come see what toi's doing this guy's literally I was like do you know is this your friend he's like you start like making fun of him but you actually like sit next to him you're like well hold on hold on let me like like why is he doing that with this dragon you know like Yeah well yeah well why did you go left he should have G he should have gone left he went right he's like this guy's the best player on the Korean server so they they played this match last night Korean time whatever I'm watching it now and I was like you are the weirdest nerd and but this guy is the weirdest guy uh you know he he does like many many weird things this was one of them and I remember just laughing at I'm making fun of him fast forward 10 years I go and I I'm like announcing and our LinkedIn or whatever like hey we sold our company bibo to Twitch super excited join the exec team at twitch he C I get this call from tofi tofi calls me uh you know twice a year I get this call from toi I pick up I'm expecting congratulations he just goes you little [ __ ] and I'm like what and he's like you used to make fun of me for this [ __ ] and now you're Mr twitch and I was like oh yeah that's right I forgot about that dudee you were way ahead of the curve I should have listened to you like I could have created twitch if I had like if I leaned into this Insight that people want to watch other people play video games God I love a guy who holds a garage for 10 years by the way dude he was he was ready I like the cut of your jib guy I'm about it and so anyways that that's kind of the the the this learning of if you see people doing the strange Behavior right like I remember seeing people wear those Vibram five toe shoes where you're like you're going to run Barefoot why do you do that like you know and they're like super into that lifestyle I saw a video of Joe Rogan talking about people who hunt white bucks or some [ __ ] like that like you know some certain type of deer I guess he goes dude people don't realize how crazy this lifestyle is and he started explaining that people will build fields of like food and like Lounge areas to try to attract these bucks in to hunt they like spend months building these like you know man caves for bucks just to attract them and then hunt them right and I was like that's crazy that I bet they people getting people getting cold ice baths every morning people ice bats every morning just like you people who um I met a guy yesterday makes $5 million doing a woodworking course woodworking no way and it's like why because people who are into woodworking are not just kind of into woodworking you can only be really into Woodworking and um so this is CRA if you see this strange obsession that is the basis for store our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better so that's the first thing second thing these guys are crushing it with YouTube or organic content they built their YouTube channel up to 2 million subscribers and I think this is one of those like really cool growth acts I think it's worth going and looking at where they just do these unboxings they got like you know like cute girls who are into katas like nerding out about katanas as they unbox them it's like yeah I can see a bunch of dudes getting really into this channel that makes sense to me like I think that's going to be like I think there's a lot of people who are going to like this brand and like this content there so I think they're just doing a really good job I think it's really good execute like 10 out of 10 execution at like a five out of 10 opportunity um but like you know still nonetheless a lot lot you can kind of learn from this dude I'm looking at their YouTube I don't understand a lot of these references because it's like anime based but they don't do that many videos it looks like they do one or two a month and they all kind of hit this is they also do I think a lot of Tik toks maybe so I think they do they do Tik toks they basically just move their Facebook ad budget into hiring a full-time female Creator to do this content and that sort of thing and so uh yeah I think they're it's it's a really cool really cool brand so I just wanted to share give the guy a shout out because I figured name but on Twitter he's like showing all the back end like he's taking screenshots of their YouTube and he's a really really good follow he's really been fascinating name I forget his name too I'll find it second but he said something like um he said something like they uh they got something like two or 300 million views in the last year and they only started this past year uh and he's like we're getting 8 million a month Isaac what's his so his name is Isaac he's the Isaac Med MBD his bio says scaling a sword brand to nine figures with Organic video marketing well if that ain't exactly what we just described you know like perfect description yeah he did a really good job he's really cool also I like his profile picture a lot he kind of looks like a madman he did like a good clear head shot but he kind of looks like a madman instead of like a tryhard and I just appreciate anybody that's not a try hard by the way pet peeve I feel like all of Twitter is so cringe and try hard and I don't know if anything changed or I changed but do you feel this way like I feel like 90% of tweets and including my own tweets I'm like is there a tweet that's not cringey I think that we were the tryhards and now we're over it and we're making fun of people that are doing the exact same thing that we did yeah I love that you you use the ladder climb up and then you pull the ladder up behind you yeah yeah yeah I think that's what we're doing you know when I did it it was cool but when you do it that's small boy stuff yeah I think I think we're just uh being haters which is cool uh which is fine it's it's a that's a natural thing let me uh explain I'll wrap up with one quick thing um I posted a a researcher job so basically I don't really have a researcher you do and I'm envious of that I want that I need a little help because you're you're you always come with fire I need a little help coming up with good content for the Pod and by the way if you want to see the job just go to my Twitter and like scroll down you'll see like a Google form but so I I tweeted this out I got like 300 applicants and in order to apply I was very specific I was like if you screw up one thing on these directions like I'm not even going to consider hiring you I was like you have to like put l far job application well yeah because I was like dude if you're not going to sweat the details on this then you're not going to that's what I said if if you don't do a good job on this I I I don't believe you'll do a good job on anything else and I made people I was like I was like really simple come up with three ideas and make it in a Google doc and put the Google Doc Link in this form make it so it's readable so I can just click it if it's not readable I'm not even going to ask to like I won't even look at it and um I got hundreds of applicants about half of them follow directions and about a good chunk 25% we actually pretty legitimate what do I do with like these 100 like decent people you know it's kind of like an interesting this is like an interesting business problem or a an interesting problem if you have people so we did this with Apartments so our my first business that was an online company was basically look in San Francisco an open bedroom for a $1,200 a month apartment uh an open bedroom in a three bedroom house that gets like 500 applicants and all 500 are interested in living in the same neighborhood they're all interested in this ad so they clearly have similar interest we should just group them into their own thing and move them into their own apartment and that was the premise of my first company with this I'm like man I got like 300 people 100 are are somewhat qualif what do you do with this group of people if I can it kind seems like such a waste that I'm just using one of them you know what I mean yeah unfortunately not a lot of people need a researcher like this so I think you just need to translate it to like something like most people don't have a podcast that requires researching random business stuff so what could these people do that's what's a job that's more common that these people would be really good for is it Like Chief of Staff type roles is it like something like that you think I don't know I I have I I just started thinking about the ahead of time uh like right before we started recording but I did think this is like the uh the the application process is and this is just a little small thing imagine if you're uh Burger King or something or some huge company and you get like you know a million applicants a year uh it's like kind of interesting where if you you can only hire a couple of them and so you're like are wasting 98% you know in the same way that Ford decided to make charcoal out of their burnt wood that they were using to heat their furnaces when they were making iron can I what can my charcoal be of these 299 applicants that I don't actually hire yeah that's a great question um I don't have an answer I don't have answer sorry yeah sorry people like this is let down but it's an interesting question the thing to do would be like what what common job do these skills translate to and then you have now a cohort or a pool of people that are you know somewhat vetted that you could create like a job board or some sort of like matching Marketplace or service where people could just hire you know people like this for for that common job but uh I'm not sure well I wonder like like the people who have enough probably don't care but what like the people who like the the engineering companies or some someone who's getting like a startup that's getting an engineering company or getting Engineers to apply what they should do is just like be like hey I'm sorry you didn't get the job but here's like five other gigs that are kind of cool and just take like the 30,000 referral fee do you know what I mean so our buddy Ryan Hoover kind of did this he he was hir in a a researcher or like an analyst for his fund and he's like dude I got like hundreds of applicants I've interviewed them and he's like these I forgot how many let's call it 30 just for an example he's like these 30 were really good I just I can't hire 30 I only needed one and so he emailed me and a bunch of other people who had funds he's like do you need an analyst like here's our kind of vetted analyst that we thought were good um if you need one like I'd love to help these people get a job like he wasn't asking for any money because Ryan's a nice guy and you know this is not how he's looking to make money but like it was kind of great at the same time I was s of like I'm not looking for the sloppy seconds like these these people weren't good enough for you why why are they good enough for me there's a part of me that's like that too so I think you have that challenge if I'm a tech company I'm looking for engineers that's fair and I hire these people and you didn't hire me but you know Facebook didn't hire you but Google should and I think Google's got a little problem with that so you have to find some way around that signal problem uh same thing with Investments if I send an investment to you I'm like hey great deal not doing it though you should you should invest in this it's like that those are the worst those are the worst emails cuz it just sometimes it's true it's like oh this is just your Niche or it's your stage or whatever but a lot of times it just adds like a negative flag to it for no reason well and the answer to this might be there's nothing I could do [ __ ] him sorry guys like you gave me you you did all this work for me and you're just not you're not going to get the job and there's some guys who have applied for like eight jobs that I've had throughout the years and I feel so sad I'm like sorry you missed again we're not hiring that many people right so it's just a hard hard thing to do um all right let's wrap it up there good episode and uh yeah we'll see you guys couple days [Music]

[Music] foreign so this is the third time we're doing this it's the best part of the year the season finale it is called the melee Awards it's our annual awards show we did it the first time I think improvd uh or like pretty pretty close to it we did it just like kind of on a whim people loved it so we brought it back and now we're bringing it back again and it's basically it's our award so we do categories like Billy of the Year breakout company or person our favorite unsexy business uh our own best investments and our own worst Investments things like that um so I'm excited I already got the sort of season finale Vibes and uh I'm excited for this you want to say anything did you look you you look like you drive a white G-Wagon right now I can't believe how fast you've gone from Indian to Persian I look like my mistress drives a white G-Wagon you went from Dirty Indian to Alpha Persian with just one jacket and that's kind of amazing how that's happened I've never sold a rug but I feel like I could right now yeah and uh did you guys you guys let's see Sam you didn't get the memo about dressing up Andrew are you uh your Mikey Blazer yeah you're blazered up did you guys bring I'm wearing your cardigan bro bro you always wear a cardigan you always have like you know modern grandma style but I'm uh I'm I'm I'm at a guest place you know I'm I'm on an Airbnb I got to do what I got to do I didn't brand up I didn't bring my Persian apparel I'm sorry all right well guys cheers to a great year uh a crazy year I have I don't know what what's in everybody's cup here so Sam you're you're a classic Midwestern Cola kind of guy you probably stay cold I don't you no but I am drinking a Coke there's that great map where it's like some people say Pop Some people say Cola some people say you know soda or something like that I feel like you might be a pop guy uh Andrew what you got in the cup I've got a aeropressed coffee in a tiny mug bro you just brought to you by you just sponsored this whole pot just now that was slick um I have a uh very frigid cold water with fresh lemon juice inside maybe I'm starting to cleanse I saw a great tweet he goes I don't cleanse I clog and I thought that's pretty that's pretty good you're gonna choose cleanse I'm on a cheese clog um all right so cheers to you guys uh 20 million downloads this year for the podcast which is I think six times bigger than last year my or maybe four or five five times I might have my math on there but I think YouTube's up 6X and the Pod is up 4X or something like that um big gear big year for us which is which is fun and Andrew you were the most frequent guest you're the most favorite guest and so it is only right to have you here all right so without further Ado should we jump in to the categories we're gonna go uh I'll announce the category I think and there we go kind of round robin um last year we did it where we kind of picked who had the best answer after each one I don't know if you guys want to do that or uh any any adjustments to the format here well I think by the way your order was a little off so for example if we're going to start with Billy of the year then that has the next person because it's also a the next category should be craziest person of the year as well okay okay well let's do it this way um we'll take turns uh me and you say I'm just picking categories and then uh you can go whatever order you want so okay let's start let's start with Billy of the year uh so for those who don't know we do the segment called Billy of the week where we typically will feature a billionaire or somebody who maybe is not actually technically a billionaire but they carry themselves with that billionaire energy and uh somebody who's just doing life in an interesting way so Sam who is your Billy of the Year ah mine's so boring so okay uh my boric answer is Zuck because he's proven that like he's actually pretty good all these everyone else this year that's been in his category has gone [ __ ] insane Bezos got a divorce elon's crazy all Zuck does is box that's like his version of crazy like he's turned out to be okay so I would say he's probably like emotionally stable huh yeah he's done all right but if I had to pick another one it would be this guy named Brett Adcock Brett Adcock is this guy I met about six months ago he basically is only 34 to 36 years old he's a young guy he made a lot of money when he sold his company called veteri for 100 million dollars then he created veterans like a recruiting company he's not sexy but then he created a flying drone company that he took public called Archer it was worth two or three billion at its peak now he told me that he's uh took roughly 200 million dollars of his own money which I think was like the majority of his liquid net worth other than the house that he owns and he's piled all of it into bootstrapping a new robotic company called uh where they make humanoids and that guy's pretty [ __ ] insane and I love crazy people like that that's a great one Andrew who you got Billy of the year so my mine is actually a MFM guest Palmer lucky um I feel like you know it's a little obvious but I feel like um you see so many of these billionaires who they make all this money and then they get very focused on PR and they're very safe and they won't put their money where their mouth is and what I loved about him is that a he's actually taking his own capital and investing it in and drill and doing something that is actually important in the world or what he deems important and he actually just like calls people out like he's honest he's not a politician and I think most of these billionaires you talk to they are very political they have a PR team he obviously does not I thought that was so awesome when he went to the uh what is it the all-in conference and just roasted calcamus for like an hour um so yeah mad respect I think he's awesome and I thought that was one of the best interviews of the year that's a great one um I love that one I thought I considered Palmer lucky as well I decided to go with somebody a little more under the radar not a billy not a billionaire but somebody who lives like I think a billionaire should so it's this guy who came to Camp MFM which was our kind of like private retreat of 20 or 30 badass people that we did who Al no Syed Saeed said so Saeed is a guy I didn't know much about you had mentioned him before I didn't I never met him he might be a billionaire he might be but uh but it doesn't matter he lives like one so when we met him at the camp I was like so what do you do he first of all he just had the most chill energy he was not stressed he was not worried he was not seeking attention he was he had none of those small boy traits and instead he was relaxed he was having fun he was asking people questions and I asked him I said so what do you what do you do and he's like well you know I and he he started to explain and somebody else cut him off and was like let me brag for you for a second here so what Syed owns is basically the largest collection of Wordpress websites and tools so if you search for WordPress like you know WordPress powers like 30 or 40 of all internet websites and so people are often searching how do I do this on my WordPress site you'll land typically on one of his websites like wpbeginner or WP engine or whatever and from there it'll say well if you want to capture emails of people who come in using Wordpress like a email capture pop-up use optinmonster owned by also Saeed and so he basically has the landing spot where people come he's got the number one search rankings then he owns the tools that he refers and so he turned his random curious traffic into SAS subscribers it basically built an Empire he's telling us about the gas stations he owns and all the other crazy stuff he does with his money and his work style was was one that I envy he's like well here's my month the last week of the month I do all my meetings with the operators of my businesses I was like so what do you do the other three weeks and he's like one egg one to one and a half weeks we travel so we just go to Costa Rica then we go to Egypt then we go wherever like me my family we just love to travel and then I read and I just chill out and I think uh the other the other week and a half I play with my son a lot we play basketball and I was like wow this guy is dominating his business Niche but he's also checking the Box on family he's checking the Box on travel he's got it going on so I was really impressed by Syed this he also very very uh giving too he he gives away a lot of money too yeah amazing guy so uh so he's mine that's uh all right so those are the billies of the year I I'll just put it out there I think Palmer was the right answer what do you think Sam I agree Palmer was the right answer you're if you haven't seen the clip of him going to Jason calacanus's conference like going to someone's birthday party and roasting them uh that was epic Andrew did you hear on our pod when we asked Palmer if you could kick Jason's ass yeah when he was talking about his scare his like how tall he was he goes yeah he was like well you know if you look at the physics of this I I forget exactly how he explained it but he was like a very engineer he goes like six one yeah he said something like that like it it was pretty funny all right let's go to the next category Sam you can pick one um let's talk about the biggest L we each took this year okay Andrew you go first Adrian by the way this category the biggest l so it's the biggest loss you took but it can be it doesn't have to be like a big serious thing it's just it's just a loss that you put in the in the Lost column however big or small it was in your life yeah so I read this book about 15 years ago by this guy ramit Sethi uh he's got a website I will teach you to be rich and he's got a book called I will teach you to be rich and at the time I knew absolutely nothing about personal finance or Finance at all and he had this really great section where he says people think they need to save money on lattes what they actually need to save money on is percentages and so he's talking about interest rates on credit cards interest rates on mortgage uh fees and real estate transactions like the difference between two percent and 2.5 percent is like twenty thousand dollars and people don't think about that he says uh he goes don't worry about three dollar problems worry about worry about thirty thousand dollar problems exactly so I had one of those um so you know maybe like two episodes of you know a couple interviewers ago I talked about um you know interest rates and the risks there and this was very top of mind because we had a piece of debt in the company that uh I wanted to lock in the interest rate on one and so we were going to buy all these Hedges and in order to do that I had to sign all these documents and I'm kind of lazy I hate signing documents and so these documents were sitting in our office and I was like oh I'll do it tomorrow I'll do it tomorrow I kept putting it off and then finally I signed it and I realized that between the time that I it was sitting there for a week and in that week the interest rate went up by like one percent and that represented like five hundred thousand dollars or something insane and so just me being lazy and not signing that document and not thinking in percentages cost me like 500 Grand that's a great one um this year I met a guy who had an app called intro it's a great app and I agreed to do it because he was like hey come try this and I did and it was one of the big bigger mistakes of the year that I made so basically I'm on this app called intro where for a little while people could you you were bragging about how you were crushing it on intro how is this the L that's such a weak move on my part to do it so this app I got on there because I was like oh you know and honestly it's fun it is quite fun to use it's fun to like meet new people but people pay me for my time and it's quite addicting because it's real you can make a substantial amount of money doing that but if I'm supposed to be such a big swing of dick if I'm supposed to be a hot shot like I want to be I shouldn't be selling my time or at least I shouldn't be selling my time and keeping the money I should just give it away and it was that was a big uh that was a weak move on my part to uh be selling my time and I regret doing that that's a that's a great one I was making fun of you for that and uh and then I was also kind of like wait should I be doing that that is a lot of money don't sell your time don't sell your time such short-term thinking and you know who really changed my opinion of it who actually could be Billy the year what's the guy Brian Johnson Brian Johnson from um uh Braintree he like kind of like didn't mean to do it but he like was razzmy on using it and I was like you're right what did I say that wasn't he was telling us well he told the story he didn't he wasn't directing it towards me but he told the story about how he was like instead of like getting this job like I should just put more effort into my company so then in three years this won't even be a problem instead of right now I could just make this money that could temporary fix this no I should go for the long-term fix and make it so like I don't even have to budget ever again yeah I see a lot of so I think like all three of us kind of probably grew up not having a ton of money um and really really valuing like every dollar right so like I remember um you know a thousand dollars was like a crazy amount of money to me because I could buy an iMac and if I bought an iMac then I could have one of my staff do all this work and I could make like twenty thousand dollars from it and so I feel like I still if I I'm not careful I think in those terms and when someone comes along and offers you a thousand dollars an hour it's like completely insane as an opportunity or like three grand an hour or four grand for an hour it is crazy it's amazing but you get and I know all these people that are like I know guys that are worth 50 million dollars and they still manage their own Airbnb bookings and they'll be like oh sweet I tweaked this I made an extra 300 in cleaning fees or whatever and I always think like you guys used a quote before but it's like you're playing you're playing a pennies or sorry you're you're saving pennies in a dollars game like it's just ridiculous yeah that's uh yeah but some people enjoy that like Nathan Barry uh Nathan Berry owns convertkit he's probably worth 200 plus million dollars based off the valuation convertkit and he's still I'll be with him and applaud his phone and he's like messaging Airbnb guests I'm like why are you doing this he goes I love it and so in that case I'm like all right cool I don't like taking intro calls necessarily sometimes I do but uh yeah yeah there's a there's a good test I remember I talked to this guy when we got acquired by twitch I talked to a guy who had been acquired by twitch three years ago and I was like yo let's get lunch so we go out for lunch and I'm like um you know he's like yeah you're gonna love it you know yeah but watch out for this he's like giving me a bunch of tips I'm like okay great um let me give you a tip real quick uh yeah I just got here but let me give you a tip I was like why are you still here and he's like oh dude um I really like my job actually you know I I didn't think I would stay here but I really like it you know it's it's fun I just blah blah he tells you tell me how great it is but I had kind of seen him in a couple meetings at this point and I was like these meetings aren't fun so like you know I don't know what you're doing the other hours a day but I saw you for like half a day last week and that that didn't seem fun at all um I said okay well maybe it is fun but let me just ask you something um you made you know he probably made like 10 20 million dollars on sale I said uh I said you don't need this job but uh but but you're not at the point where for you you're just gonna stop working all together blah blah and I said uh I said if you had 100 million dollars in the bank like literally like if I open up your bank account right now is 100 million dollars just sitting there would you come into work tomorrow like would you would you would you do this just for fun because at that point you know what you're making here every year is a rounding error it's a you you just make that in in an interest uh if you were uh if you had 100 million dollars sitting there he's like well no then I would go do XYZ and I was like okay cool so this as long as we're just being honest like I'm not saying you're miserable here I agree but the stories we tell ourselves in order to justify doing something that we're actually doing for the money but we don't want to say we're doing it for the money we want to say we're doing it for all these other reasons there's a very simple test imagine you had all the money would you still do this thing and like but the other the other the dangerous thing about that logic so Ryan holiday has this great daily stoic podcast and re recently he had um a excerpt from Stephen pressfield's book he's got all these books about kind of discovering your thing and your Mastery and art and all this kind of stuff and he talks about how people get addicted to patterns so people can be addicted to um love they they can be addicted to money they could be addicted to you know any almost anything and the question I always ask myself is I might love designing the website or I might love going into the Shopify stats and seeing the sales or doing the Airbnb management but is that just me addicted to those dopamine hits distracting myself from my greater purpose right from doing something where I have Mastery that's new am I just going back to the same thing right like you guys know the joy there's this amazing confirmation bias Joy of reading a book and hearing something you already know confirmed over and over and over again I'll do this with like uh value investing books right and I'll go oh I already know that I do that I feel good right that's actually a waste of time and so that's the flip side of it the other one is uh my buddy told me this when I when I'd been working on my startup for six or seven years and he was like he's like he told me he's like you know I just don't get what you're doing I was like well what do you mean I can explain it and he's like no not the logic of it he's like I just feel like let me ask you a question if this all went away is this what you would sign up to go do like would you basically like like take the example of the guy I was talking to if you got if you weren't doing this job is it would you just apply for this job here no you would go do something completely different like you're here because you got Acquired and then you're here and now fast forward three or four years later you're still here doing the same job but if I took this job away you would never go to a job posting and apply for this job and he's and so he was explaining that he's like you know inertia is just a [ __ ] he's like whatever your an object in motion will stay in motion whatever you're doing you're probably most likely you're doing it because you were already doing it not because you think it's the thing you actually should do in most cases and so you got to be really aware of that all right um so what's yours okay so uh wait what is the category even what are we in your biggest l oh my biggest L okay I have one that's sort of like yours I was chasing pennies in a dollar game so I recently moved and uh your boy rents I'm a renter and so I moved from one rental to another a new house and I was like oh I love this I could just like move whenever I want don't have to worry about anything just call the movers I broke my lease I just moved but um my landlord came in and uh first you know did a walk through of the place when I was there you know we talked about his you know his family his history in this house shook hands in the garage said you know it's been nice having you all right see you later you know don't worry about all the stuff everything looks fine three weeks later he hits me with like a 20 or 30 000 bill and um at least twenty thousand he gets me with the extra twenty thousand dollar bill on the move out for like you know scratches and like you know stuff like with he right no he was not right it was and he had he's a lawyer so he had baked into the lease that like hey anything that's associated with the move out is your cost like for example if I fly to California to observe the move out you have to pay for my flights my hotels my food my this my like there's a [ __ ] in there that was like not like I didn't damage the property it was just like extra stuff but he had put it in the lease I had signed the lease because like you know like Andrew I don't really I I don't really read it or if I read it I'm not going to read what are words yeah it's like uh you know I'm optimistic at the beginning of things I'm like this is gonna go great he's gonna be a chill dude just like I would be well he's never gonna hold me to any of these things and like sure enough he held me to the letter of the law and every single thing and so he so I decide to do something that we talked about on this uh on this podcast I decided to take him to Petty court and so a lawyer a guy who listened to the Pod who's a lawyer reaches out he's like yo I heard about the landlord thing I'm ready to fight to the death on this for free and I was like let's do this and so in my head I was like I'm gonna fight this 20 grand got this lawyer now he's got Troy you know he's a great dude um got to know him a little bit through this process but we try fighting back we and the problem is I'm going against an 87 year old retired lawyer who's got nothing not my time on his hands he this is probably the biggest thrill he's had in 37 years to fight and be and you know like look up every California statute and he sends me these packets of like 47 documents he sends me CD-ROMs full of photos of the property I'm like dude I don't have a CD player to put this in what about how am I supposed to see these photos and he's just sending me letter after letter and he's I took a guy to Petty Court who is like the king of petty court and in the end I end up paying the full amount just by saying eff it and I'm like because I'm like dude I'm wasting my time I'm wasting this lawyer's time I might say this old guy's time but he's got infinite time and uh he is built for this whereas I should have just wrote this 20K check and just moved on with my life five weeks ago and I knew it because at night when before I was going to sleep I was up I was like oh [ __ ] I didn't respond to that [ __ ] subpoena he sent me basically this like giant package of letters I was like okay I'm gonna call him I'm gonna say this he's gonna say that I was like imagining this whole debate in my head I was like dude what a waste of mental space and once I finally had that realization that I was playing a small boy game by losing my mental like my mental space in my head that could be done used on productive things in order to be in petticort I wrote the check and I moved on with my life dude I think it's worth fighting those things by the way no no it's 100 dude going to war for the sake of war is worth it I had the Sam on my shoulder and I had the Andrew on my shoulder and I listened to the salmon I should have never listened to the Sam I wasted four weeks of my life that's like you're you're like a bull in a china shop and there's this tiny little fly buzzing on you and you just have to ignore it there's a great quote on this that someone said to me once when I was going through something similar and the guy said Never Wrestle a pig you'll both get dirty but the pig will enjoy it yeah that is exactly there's no problem I'm the pig here I'm the pig here what I I had Sean I had the you know my situation yeah I had something like this go on this year too and I texted Andrew I go what do I do and he said the same thing he goes don't wrestle with pigs or whatever this [ __ ] biblical [ __ ] and I bought into it and it eats me it eats me every night that someone that someone got someone I got got you there's what's the Charlie Munger calls it um the rats and The Granary right if you own a granary you have a big Warehouse full of grain there's gonna be rats you can keep killing them over and over again but they're gonna always come back and it's better to just accept that there's rats out there said we got rats at your Granary bro yeah okay let's go to the next one okay cool um all right let's go to the next category let's do we're gonna do breakout company which is sort of the sexy one and then let's do the unsexy business of the year so we'll do we'll do both first let's do the uh the breakout company of the year uh Andrew you want to go first yeah I mean this is so obvious but I and I I came up with a few others but I just I feel like we both want to say the same obvious thing where everyone's gonna say the same eye open AI open AI gpt3 is shocking I think this is like a watershed moment and uh I there's nothing else I haven't seen anything like this in probably 10 years I have two words for you guys that that will change your opinion yeah liver King what this guy called his shot man that's the trooper you're gonna tell me that that dude when you have Elon Musk and Sam Altman and 10 billion dollars that's not a breakout company that's not a breakout that's just that's a company that they are who we thought they were they did exactly what we thought they were gonna do that that doesn't count as a breakup you're saying you expected you expected like when I I remember a friend of mine called me about a month before they released the chat and was like oh my God it's amazing and I kind of rolled my eyes you know I didn't wasn't super excited about it but I have not seen anything this crazy in a very long time I mean obviously Dolly and stuff is insane too but the chat it's just nuts I've actually stopped using Google a lot of the time and started using the chat do well look they you took the nerdiest of nerds the smartest guys on Earth and who gave them 10 billion dollars and he locked him in a room for six years yeah but like if you knew their friends if it was 1945 and you're like what's the breakout project of the year and I'm like it's the Manhattan Project and you're like oh well this got billions of dollars and whatever it's still [ __ ] crazy they made a nuclear bomb it's crazy this is like a nuclear bomb moment it's just like my expectations they met my expectations like If This Were if this were like uh if this was like a second grade report report card it would definitely be like met expectations there would not be there would not be like yeah yeah this is not an exceed I kind of felt like it was a goofy project I was like oh you know Google Apple all these other people they're gonna do this for you know they have a huge incentive profit incentive these guys are going like non-profit when they first started and it's kind of like all about openness and whatever it's morphed into something that I didn't expect and I certainly didn't expect it to do as well as it did given all the star power I think often think about like super groups super groups are usually not that good it was like a super group yeah I mean the Avengers worked out but yeah I feel you I I feel you I mean like in music so Sam yours your your breakout person or company is liver King not AI I mean yeah we're Andrew Tate but yeah one of those guys we did an episode where we detailed the leaked emails from the liver King where he's like yo I'm gonna take a bunch of steroids I'm gonna build this brand and then I'm gonna sell like 100 million dollars worth of products that's what I'm gonna do and then he did it so that's so much more dope all right let me merge the tune so Sam you like the call your shotness Andrew you're like wow open at my Sam Altman you guys have done something magical I'm gonna give you a called shot that I think is kind of unbelievable to be honest with you okay so Paul Graham is going to win my award here for calling it they call your shot moment so back in 2009 Paul Graham wrote a blog post so this is now what like 13 years ago or something like that Paul Graham writes a blog post it's called if you go to paulgram.com Five Founders the number five in the founders he says inc.com recently asked me oh yeah my most interesting Founders are the last 30 years he goes how do you decide who's interesting I think it's influence you know who are the five have influenced me the most who do I use as examples when I'm talking to companies that I'm funding who do I find myself quoting a lot and it's everybody you would expect it's Steve Jobs is number one he's got Larry and Sergey from Google he's got like his buddy but Paul bukite who uh invented Gmail and also wrote the first prototype for AdSense and gave Google the Mantra of don't be evil okay everything's expected so far and number five he says Sam Altman hey guys I was told I shouldn't mention who at the time by the way was 22 I think right yeah exactly at the time he's probably 21 or 22 years old and he was wearing he was wearing double pop neon colors with Steve Jobs exactly very embarrassing put up a photo of him doing this uh uh announcement at the at the Apple conference where he's wearing a double Polo neon popped collar uh it's it's really incredible you wouldn't think that that guy's gonna rule the world but but Paul Graham knew that he would so he's here's what he wrote about Sam Alvin back in 2009 he goes I shouldn't mention a YC founder um but Sam Altman cannot be stopped by flimsy rules if he wants to be on this list he is going to be honestly Sam is along with Steve Jobs the founder I refer to most when I'm advising startups on question of design I asked what would Steve do but on a question of strategy or ambition I ask what would samma do uh when when I learned meeting Sama is that the doctrine applies the doctrine of the elect applies to Startup it applies in a way that that it applies way less than most people think startup investing is not about picking winners you think might win a horse race because there are a few people with such force of will that they are going to get whatever they want and now you fast forward 13 years the guy you know basically creates this you know what's going to be a multi probably a multi-hundred billion dollar Company open Ai and brings you know one of the most magical technical like magical technology experiences which is if you're if you're using dolly or gpt3 he created and he wasn't even that successful back then by the way I don't think he had I think he I think he had sold a company but he sold it was less than they raised I don't think he sold it even at that point so let me see when it was called loot yeah it was loot um and I think they made they sold it for about 43 million dollars he sold it three years later so this was he was at the beginning of loot he sold it for 43 million and uh and I think and I I remember reading about the sale there were some there's some interesting stuff about how he uh like they sold it for less than it than it was funded for right which is like you know considered an L uh but he but he sold it in a way that he was able to pocket a few million bucks he then invested in Airbnb right away and was the first seed investor in Airbnb he's got this like you know he went on kind of an epic run post that um yeah he's a crazy guy I think that's uh that's got to be the breakout is I agree maybe Sam Altman this time can beat the liver King but it's close we could all agree you know tomato tomato the most impressive thing about liver King is he's not a good looking dude like some of these guys you see in their influencers and they're like super jacked and handsome he's not a good looking he's my example when I say I I told sahil Bloom this because saho Bloom is like the good looking version of me I was like hey if I can't be good looking I'm gonna be interesting looking and uh that's what the liver King did he's not good looking but he decided to be really [ __ ] interesting looking and that works just as well uh I then we'll have to go with Sam Altman gets it this time all right let's do unsexy business um oh dude I didn't even know what you meant by that well you go first an unsexy business is like when we do our our blue collie uh blue collar Billy of the week what do we call this [ __ ] the blue collar side hustle uh it's like a business that's not artificial intelligence or flying cars or whatever it's just like a boring unsexy business how are you confused by this this is like the premise of our podcast but I don't know all right well what podcast uh so what's yours all right I'm gonna go with um I could go with uh egg cartons but I think I've kind of beat that one to death the egg cartons.com if you haven't heard me rant about that go look up that episode that is honestly that is the most remarkable one this woman Sarah Moore but if not that I'm gonna go with one we haven't talked about that much on here it's called Aunt Flo have you heard of this business no so what are you saying the word ant I like ant I'm saying flow yeah ant flow okay all right you could say it your way sorry I just wanted to make sure that this the it's the word that we're using okay yeah so I am flow so amp flow is a business that is basically um it's period products I don't know how I'm supposed to say this but for uh it's period products so basically you go to a public restroom inside of any University a stadium whatever in the women's restroom they uh should have and now in many states they are mandating that you have to have you know tampons pads products for women and so um normally these were coming in a Dusty raggedy container uh with like really poor hygiene you gotta like open the thing and everyone's like trying to use toilet paper to like touch the thing to open it and it's like really gross I mean this is like you know there's like literally like blood on these products so it's not not like a very it's not not something that you want to touch it's not a sexy experience and what she did was she brought a sexy experience to a very unsexy industry so if you go look at their dispensers they basically made like the Tesla of of dispensers and they install it on the wall it's got this great brand she's this great founder and they are just cleaning up so they are getting conscious with universities with what and these are multi-year contracts it's installed on the wall this thing is never going to get changed it's gonna be no churn is my prediction and it's sort of like they installed a dispenser and then they have to buy the products as they as they're used or as they run out and um and she calls herself the CEO the chief estrogen officer she's just gone all in on like building this company as a woman-led company that's like making this one kind of crappy experience better and I asked her I was like did you invest in this yeah I was like I've never been in a woman's restroom before uh what's the current like who's the incumbent who are you competing against and she's like literally it's a guy named like a brand called Bob and Rick and like Bob and Rick's dispensers are like the thing and you know it's this terrible experience and we're making it better and so they're at like you know they're definitely at a sort of like high seven figures uh uh run rate where they have all these great contracts and they you know they're they're the official dispenser for all the Apple Stores and for like you know the whole state of you know I don't know Utah or whatever some State that's like mandated this can happen and I think once one state does it all these states are gonna do it so I think they're very well positioned to take a very boring Niche and build a pretty badass business and she's a teal fellow only 25 years old yeah air coder I think her name is that's right that's a good one do you have one Andrew yeah okay so um hotels are constantly trying to save money especially chains and I don't know if you've ever gone to like a hotel chain you'll notice that on the wall if it's like a cheaper one they'll have like dispensers for shampoo and soap and it's all refillable right so the idea is like you used to go to a hotel and there'd be a bar of soap in a box and you open the bar of soap and you use it to clean your ass and then they have to throw it away right so um it's a huge waste they're constantly throwing money away and so hotels have moved to these refillable things but one thing that um they can't do is toilet paper so when you go and there's a full roll of toilet paper and you use some of it you know no one wants to go into a hotel and be like oh what the heck there's like a little bit of toilet paper left there's obviously someone just here who used it and so there's someone I just heard about this business it hasn't launched yet but I thought it was fascinating basically it's a dispenser for toilet paper so it's on it actually embeds in the wall all and you basically pull out almost like you would Kleenex perfectly portion toilet paper and I don't think this would necessarily work at like a Four Seasons or a high-end place but certainly for like a Marriott or a Hilton I think they could save tons of money so I thought that was just incredibly boring and quite interesting that's a great one all right that's a good one there was one that got big doing that with uh with the shampoo bottles back in the day they would take the once used shampoo bottle and they would recycle it basically and they were just like hey Hotel will pay you nothing for it but we'll come collect it for you we'll just take it off your hands because you're just this is just trash for you and they created so have you guys invested in any boring businesses like I you know I give Nick Huber a little bit of money I think you did yeah what else what other boring stuff have you guys done uh I'm in enduring so they buy you know the same kind of boring businesses that's kind of tech I mean like I mean like brick and mortar uh development of real estate like Townhomes I feel like we it's weird because I feel like half of what we talk about on this podcast is like these Boring Brick and Mortar businesses and yet we like and we like fetishize them we don't own that many of them like yeah I own a uh an air uh air ambulance business um I you know I own a deli and bakery a bunch of kind of restaurants and that kind of stuff wait what the but I want to get your ambulance oh like helicopters ambulance so if you're like in Mexico and you need to be brought home and you've you've had a surgery or something we facilitate that um it's a very good business but I really want more of those things have you guys ever thought about like starting like a fund around that or something because I feel like it's a lot of words yeah I like to visit I don't really live there we don't have to operate you don't have to operate us just invest in all these cash flowing boring businesses I I whenever people talk about that I'm like where do you find that like like you're going to eBay like where do you like where do you find this air ambulance thing you know what I mean yeah it was like we had to we met someone through a friend of a friend it's always like someone's dad right it's like oh you know his his dad wants to retire and the kids don't want the business or something like that or these things happen at the golf course yeah I don't know yeah I should be doing that I I think I got like really Tech brainwashed because I basically I started a sushi restaurant then I moved to Australia and did like a biotech thing but then I moved to Silicon Valley when I was 24 and I was like basically I just got like really deep in the Silicon Valley kind of ethos and game and that was my that's my network and that's my my skills were around internet companies and so I think it was kind of the right move to go deep there and try to like win in that World um because I think you don't have to win in all games so like you know I have a fun to do startup investing like if I do good with if I do great with startup investing I'll do great I don't really need to also do great with a very different style of investing so I think I'm curious about it but um you know do I want to like sort of restart the learning curve in a new way but one you know you guys have this crazy advantage of you know I think your your rolling fund as well because of the podcast right so if you guys go on and you say hey who has a Granddad or a father or a mother who owns this family business that wants to sell I feel like you'd get mobbed there's something let's see all right Sean at seanpuri.com all those leads can go to me then if you guys don't want let's let's see what comes in I'll share all the interesting I'll filter all the interesting ones uh for you Andrew so Sean at seanpuri.com email me your your dad your granddad your uncle's business that we could either take like a minority stake or maybe he's looking to retire itself let's see let's see what we got um okay so those are the ones um dude you know I I did it but I I was reading about coffeezilla going deep on Andrew Tate's thing do you guys know how Andrew Tate makes money I do but go ahead he basically he has this well okay fine you got that smug look on your face it's like a cam girl's business right like it's a definition of a sexy person no no the real way to make money is yeah he's got this [ __ ] Discord that's 50 a month in order to like join and there's like channels on like copywriting it's basically just the same [ __ ] that you and I Sean have done like screwing around except do you know how big it is it's like tens of 150 million yeah no no no no no no like a million members oh wow like we're talking nine figures in revenue and coffee Zilla like did it he's like look here's all the members if you multiply that by 50 and then you can even add a discount to it it's like we're talking about north of 100 million in revenue and it's just a Discord with voluntary with volunteer community like chairs like Community leads freaking crazy and uh I considered saying for breakout person but I you know he's obviously pretty controversial so I didn't want to like I'm the breakout is I've never seen somebody go from nobody to everywhere all the time in your face the way this guy has like he built a crazy in like seven months or something like that like had you ever heard this word before Andrew Tate last year like no no I think he was the most Googled person on Earth this year that's crazy to me is that crazy and he says it and when he when he does his interviews he goes he goes Mr Beast has to spend five million dollars and blow up blow up a bus in order to get 10 million views I said I said I just talk yeah and it's true it's true the guy's way of speaking and the the things he says are so compelling and then he built this viral engine where his all hustles University is is basically yo post cut cut up clips of Tate everywhere and then go comment and basically in the comments Revere me and that's how you know and then everybody who signs up for the professor University you're gonna make money doing that like that's basically the core job is like go promote me um it's crazy it's insane it is crazy it's a multi-level marketing scheme just promoting him he is the product it's wild all right so what's uh do we vote on that one or just move to a different topic uh yeah vote okay let's do our best investment so the best investment you made and then we're gonna do worst investment also so let's start with uh let's start with best investment let's go Sam what was the best investment you made 2022 financially [ __ ] none this year was in terms of money this was horrible uh the two best uh Investments I made were getting Fitness coaches so nutritionists and and like a lifting coach a fitness coach and then also this pod this is like the first time Sean this year where like and this is actually one of my most proud moments where I've been walking around and I get noticed maybe one to three times a day and this is the first time that I'm like oh wow Sean the work that you and I have done over four or five hundred episodes it's like properly paid off yeah so that's this part is this this year it felt different has it ever has ever been annoying or yeah one time like it's there's been multiple times where Sarah and I are having like a serious conversation or we're arguing or we're having like a contentious conversation and someone pops up and like you gotta like like oh hey yeah hi hi yeah you gotta like turn it on and that kind of sucks it's like you know like when you and your wife get in a fight but then you got to get in the car together to go to like your friend's house for dinner and you gotta put on like the performance of the century that's kind of like how it feels sometimes there's a there's a uh what's her name from The Hunger Games Jennifer Lawrence her name Lawrence she talked about how she can be nice to a thousand people but if one time she's fighting with her boyfriend and she's kind of a [ __ ] to somebody they'll go on Reddit and post about it and she feels like you basically always have to be that person and it's only a matter of time until you snap knowing you it's only a matter of time one time we are at um you know we're we're exploring the pregnancy thing this year and one time we were at the baby baby doctors and someone in the waiting room said something to me and uh I was I was I didn't I was rude apology there all right I'll do a quick one okay so best financial investment I invest in this company called triple will that's basically like a uh it's a tool for Shopify store owner so it helps you like see your dashboard and uh make sure your ads are working well and they have like a bunch of different features I invest in this thing because I I was like oh I like this I want to use this for my Ecom store maybe I should just invest in it really didn't think this was gonna I thought if and I did this by the way I took my portfolio and I ranked like what do I think are going to be the breakouts and what do I think are least likely to be the breakouts because I I suspected I might be surprised I was very surprised so us I think our 75 000 investment in triple whale is currently worth 3.3 million and so uh that's been the the biggest breakout from the fund so far and it's would have been one of the five that I did not guess would be this explosive rocket ship because like that's just not how I thought about it back then like when I saw it it looked like this cool Analytics tool for Ecom you know Shopify stores I don't know how big that is I don't know how fast it'll grow it's been insane so that's my financial one and then I'll also say um we did Camp MFM and that was an amazing investment I'll tell you a little little story about it so we did this camp 20 30 people we go to North Carolina and we fly in this NBA trainer so we pay for his kind of him and his buddy like they're they're uh fights at hotels or whatever we rent these airbnbs we do the camp it's great everybody chipped in I think like a thousand bucks or 1500 bucks two grand or something yeah I thought I thought that would cover the cost didn't quite cover it I think we're in the whole like 15 grand or something like that no problem uh amazing experience just for the basketball all the fun meeting people all that good stuff but something kind of crazy happened um we tweeted out that we were hanging with Mr Beast or something like that or that uh that maybe the Pod we recorded with Mr Beast and a guy saw that started following Ben Levy Ben Levy then checks out this guy's profile um oh this guy's in the crypto space DM's him oh let's talk you know maybe they'll advertise with us we end up getting an acquisition offer from this person that's not the deal we ended up going with but it gave us the leverage in the deal we did end up going with uh and like opened this door into acquisition and it's all like if we hadn't tweeted out that thing that we were doing with Mr Beast I don't think this person would have followed and then I don't think that conversation would happen and so the world Works in these really funny ways where this like kind of amazing acquisition we had this year I don't know they could have just as easily not happened or been for a lot less had we not like just done this totally unrelated thing that's good good things happen because it's great all right Andrew what you got best investment so Mine mine's actually an investment I made a couple years ago but it's taken a while to play out and it's very small um but I really like this one so um you guys know Sophia Amoroso I think she's been on the podcast before um I met Sophia like five or six years ago and she just had the experience with nasty gal and she's like I'm trying to figure out what to do next I've written this book called girl boss and I've kind of built this community around it this social following I want to turn it into a business and I said like look you know I think you should bootstrap this but she got mobbed with uh VCS and so it was easy money great valuation raised like 10 million bucks or something and because she took VC money she had this really wonderful business but she had to turn into a billion dollar thing and this is girl so suddenly this is girl boss and so she uh you know raised all this money and she's like I'm gonna build basically like LinkedIn slash like a social network for female entrepreneurs to connect them which we all know is like the world's biggest lift it's like oh my most impossible to start a social network and so she ended up running out of cash getting exhausted she sold it to attention capital and they basically were just like [ __ ] we don't know what to do about this like we we shouldn't have bought this and so they reached out to us and we were able to buy it for a really really cheap just because the business was totally distressed um and so you know we looked at it and we're like okay like let's just go back to basics this business has almost 2 million social followers and email subscribers and we just did basic stuff we built a daily email newsletter we sold ads we did social ads we did affiliate we rebooted the podcast brought on a great CEO and it's just been this phenomenal base hit and I just got an update from our CEO uh Lulu who's like freaking amazing and basically now the business is I won't say numbers but it's making as much as we paid for it every year in profit and I think it's probably 5 or 10x more valuable than what we paid for it at least um so I I just love that kind of stuff where we're able to take a business that shouldn't have raised venture or you know kind of failed in Venture Land and actually make it a sustainable business that'll be going for five or ten years at least that's crazy yeah that's really cool I like those and I think there's gonna be a bunch of those Venture businesses that fail that's another one if you're a venture business and you're not gonna be able to raise the next round because the whole Market is turned or whatever uh it's not over and there's like a way to structure these deals I think most Founders just throw in the towel don't know what to do with that asset but uh again there's a lot there's a lot of these businesses where you let's say a business gets to five or ten million dollars of Revenue and they're burning you know a million two million a month because they're like Venture backed or whatever to the founder you know they're just like okay well this is worth nothing you know let's go sell to Facebook and we'll take it Aqua hire and they actually will throw out their existing business that business has value and people like us and enduring will buy it and turn it around and make you know make it into something that'll actually make them proud um so yeah I mean it's it all is not like enduring to that with up Council that's what that was the example totally can we um we gotta do worship my worst one is a personal real estate like I bought real estate over the last two years and I'm in I'm made money on on all of it so far and like technically speaking like it's all like gonna beat the stock market well that's easy because the stock market sucks but like some of my investment it's like my Airbnb it's still like a eight percent return or something like that but it's just a [ __ ] headache dude I regret buying real estate I wish I didn't own any real estate and I wish I just invested in other people's funds yeah that's my worst investment it just it's caused me a dispersional amount of headache yeah that's a good one uh all right mine is uh mine's really hard to choose so many losers to choose from this year so uh so people know my portfolio is essentially tech stocks and crypto um tech stocks down somewhere between 40 and 85 percent this year crypto down 75 percent this year or sometimes 100 in certain cases uh I think Luna has to be my pick because it went to zero um and so that was just like you know what a 100 loss that happened in like three days so last year this episode last year here's here's Sean's company to watch Tara slash Luna that was his answer I said company to watch and it sure did give you some entertainment yeah you want you watched it go down and then his prediction was that the Winkle VI twins the the Winklevoss twins are gonna be richer than Zuckerberg so that is a long-term prediction but you you bet on Luna so so you're gonna double down this is the question are you gonna double down on your winkle VI prediction and what's the timeline and what's the punishment if you lose no no these are supposed to be crazy predictions these are not supposed to be things I think are going to happen they're sort of like far-fetched predictions no I don't I don't want to double down on that I would say that's looking way less likely now than it did then um but you know it's basically like a Facebook stock got crushed a little bit this year too I I had calculated that I think I forgot what it is now but I think Bitcoin would have needed to be at if Bitcoin got to 2 million dollars a coin then the Winkle and Facebook had like you know uh you know kept his value or something like that based on how much Bitcoin they owned I thought okay at that point they all have surpassed uh a suit but the Hedge was always if Zucker owns any Bitcoin then they can really never pass him um you know if he put a minority stake in but I don't think Zuck cares if the wake of fire are rich or not I I don't think that's a concern of his so what's what's yours Andrew um so mine is really just Venture in general so we I've been doing Angel Investing For 10 plus years and I think I've done well um on a cash basis I've got a lot of money back but I haven't actually like if I think about it um even if I've made 15 to 30 a year I haven't had access to that cash the entire time whereas in my main business when I buy a business and I make you know make 20 or 30 return I'm actually getting that cash and I'm compounding it and then I'm investing it and doing more and more and more and I think psychologically there's a big difference between owning a whole bunch of businesses and doing 50 million dollars in ebitda versus uh owning a bunch of stakes that are a liquid and a bunch of venture businesses where maybe you'll get your money in 10 to 15 years and so I don't think that it's necessarily saying I don't want to invest in Venture go forward but it's just been I think it's been a bad if I think of it as if my goal is to maximize my capital and feel rich it's not the best way to do that I think that I'm much better off incubating businesses and uh buying businesses because it's a very steady 15 to 30 percent cash return and I feel it I feel the win in a much bigger way and I think that like anyone over the last two years there's some businesses where I look at the valuation I invested at and I I knew it at the time I sucked it up and was like [ __ ] you know this is just the world we're in but there's some businesses with like now maybe like four million dollars of Revenue and they raised it like 100 million dollar valuation and I'm just like okay that's just gone yeah well that sucks we all just we all just said horrible things that we did this year I don't know just just bask in the uh in the in the hill Look At You Know You're Gonna you can't you can't have a non-error right you know like you can't be an investor and not have a portfolio of bad Investments of bad decisions right like that is there's not really a thing if you're gonna do this uh and you're gonna take you know the appropriate amount of risk that would get a reward you can't have a zero percent error rate and so I don't think it's anything to be shy of also you know I think a lot of people you know are have portfolios that are down this year just by the nature of like what's going on in the market there's that uh there's that logic brain coming in to save you yeah I know I mean that but that's like a that's where the logic brain is actually like useful all right like I learned this in poker too like you oh I had pocket aces and I lost I literally know people that will fold pocket queens or something like that in poker why because they're traumatized from the bad beat they got one time and there are Jacks I hate Jacks like you what do you mean you hate pocket Jacks why um like why don't you you know just because you got your money in good but it turned out not the way you wanted like you know being able to assess the decision and not the result is so key what I when I'm making fun of myself for for fomoing into Investments it's because I think my decision was bad sure the result was bad but my decision was bad I have many Investments where I think the decision is good and the result might be bad for a period of time that's okay uh but being able to separate the twos is super important I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better [Music] um Sam what topic you want to go to which category dude I want to combine book of the year and favorite podcasts or news person newsletter or person you subscribe to so I want to like we'll do a few actionable things like best things that we um yeah like best bit bits of content mine for a favorite person I sort of favorite person is it's two you already named one of them Paul Graham dude Paul Graham is such a beautiful writer I started reading all of his work again this year he's such an awesome writer he talks about money living happiness raising a family he's a really good writer I love reading him the other one is cultural tutor do you guys know who cultural tutor is on Twitter never heard of it so it's this person um who I don't think they're crazy popular but I'm going to give you an example of a thing that they tweeted so it's called It's called The the cultural tutor a beautiful education that's their thing and so they'll do like posts about like um uh I'll I'll let me find a good one but it's all about culture so basically right now uh minimalism is a thing so if you look at like a lot of new buildings minimalism is a thing and the cultural tutor will do this thread saying uh this is actually pretty lame about this architecture it's pretty boring here's the ornate stuff that we used to do and here's why we used to do it and here's why we do minimalism now and it makes you like question uh certain things that we're doing or another one could be um um here's like a famous uh piece of art and it was actually revolutionary uh and here's or here's why Mona Lisa here's why it looks like her eyes are following you and this doesn't seem interesting now but it was interesting because back then here's how they used to do things and here's what was actually revolutionary about that painting things like that I love the cultural tutor it's a really good follow that's a good one um you said you were gonna combine that with book of the year book of the Year Blitz have you ever read Blitz Andrew it's about the story of drug use during World War II I mean you you've got meth and you've got Hitler I mean what could go wrong it's a frame breaking book basically the whole hypothesis was that during World War II you know how like they gave soldiers like pieces of chocolate and cigarettes to keep them happy well and in Nazi Germany era they gave them meth and one of the one of the reasons it says Hitler was being crazy and making a lot of the decisions that he did not only was he like a hateful crazy person but they're saying it was also because he was on meth the whole time and he was going nutty and one of the reasons why he killed himself was he basically ran out of drugs in the last two weeks in his bunker what do you got there Sean is that Blitz right there no this is that place I'm looking at the book I think I'm gonna choose but Andrew go go next so my favorite podcast I'm absolutely obsessed with Founders which is by David senra and what he basically does is he reads business biographies um and then he summarizes them really really well so there's a lot of I've read a lot of business biographies I really enjoy them but there's a lot of them where I'm like I just I'm not gonna spend 15 hours of my life learning about JFK's dad right there's this there's there's always books on my bookshelf that taunt me and so I read that book He's a patriarchy yeah I read about a quarter of it it was great but but um he he'll do like the one one and a half hour summary and so a it's a great way to remind yourself like I I read Titan a couple years ago about John D Rockefeller and I re-listened to it it reminded me of a lot of the lessons and then B it'll actually tell me do I want to read this book is this person actually interesting or just give me a cursory understanding of that person so I absolutely love that one in terms of books the one that I loved over the last year is the operator which is about David Geffen the guy is a absolute lunatic it's fascinating like the picture of him um you know why is he the way he is deep dive on him started he started records I mean this guy this guy was like um he's touched so many Industries you know huge musicians too at this point like yeah I mean yeah fascinating career but also an incredible investor um and capital allocator and stuff but what a fascinating book and it's one of those ones where it's very unflattering but it's incredible okay that's worth like five or ten billion dollars at this point I mean he's like a big deal all right I'll do um book I'm gonna have I got two two picks that I thought were good uh I only read probably three or four books this year but uh this one so think on these things by krishnamurthy that's like a uh life philosophy book that uh bro I love you said that was your favorite book one time and I asked you how far into the book you've read and you said you're on the first three pages yeah actually uh I'm only about 30 pages in now uh so I've gone from three to Thirty in a year I think it might have been my pick last year too um this book is so heavy man it's got like uh let me see how far dude it's not okay it's like 250 Pages 110 pages in um so some 110 pages in and uh it's it's an amazing book the second one is uh Andrew you probably read this richer wiser happier it's a great book for anybody who likes investing um and basically yeah there's a great book for anybody who likes investing I think it's a it's a it's a fun read so uh those are my two favorite books that I read this year and then podcast newsletter or person I'm gonna give two kind of shout outs a person one that's a little under the radar is called 10K diver if you follow this guy on Twitter so yeah the 10K diver the bio just it's the literally it's a number 10 then K diver uh it says I help people understand the fundamentals of finance and investing and um I think it's called 10K diver because it's like the form 10K like the the that's like the the name of the form or whatever so uh he just gives really great threads about like very basic fundamentals of Finance and I find myself reading these and thinking oh surely I know you know about whatever topic it is certainly I know about stock based compensation certainly I know you know whatever cash flow and then you read it and you're like I always learn something from it and I think he's a great writer he's very clear he's very helpful um I just think it's a great great one to follow it's like you know there's a lot of junk food on Twitter and I would say that 10K diver is not junk food I even took his like Maven course um but did you really I I only attended like half of the sessions just because like you know it's hard to make that much time um super interesting dude and uh and you know I I don't know the course wasn't like mind breaking for me but um I don't know it's it's all good stuff it's all good stuff and so I really I really liked uh I really like the way this guy thinks um okay so that's the the person one and okay book so I did book all right we're good we're good on those we all all three did ours yeah all right cool yeah what uh what topic you want to do next wild predictions okay what you got mine's easy I think by the way you want me to read your wild predictions from last year should I read our predictions yeah all right our predictions from last year Sams was um San Francisco is going to be cool again San Francisco will be cool again you think you hit that or no no but I don't think I'm I I I'm I early I'm not off my prediction but I'm but yeah I'm a little early it's gonna come back man because Sanford I went back there it is awesome San Francisco is awesome yeah you said something about the YouTuber meet Kevin and that uh he will be like and his company's gonna break out or something like that I don't know what that prediction was oh yeah I totally was wrong uh totally at home Diagnostics you said was the industry to watch yeah nothing happened there and then you said overrated the Creator economy slash web3 nailed it yeah I emailed that one um Andrew your predictions were that high and high salary inflation is not here to stay companies are going to Outsource an offshore um Talent what do you think about that one I still think it's right I think that it just took I think we're just seeing it now basically as these Tech layoffs happen I think they're going to go globally right um and then you said overrated you said nfts um I think we I think we structured this differently last time we did like companies to watch overrated thing to watch I said overrated with spax I think that was right um I said a company to watch Tara Luna that was way wrong and my crazy prediction was that the book of I will end up richer than Zuck which is you know early like we already talked about okay so this year what do you got for a prediction or predictions for 2023 so we structured it differently but let me say my mine too because they're fast one Elon Musk either dies or he or he gets canceled or he gets canceled in an incredibly like serious way and Tesla stock completely tanks the second thing is so open eye open AI um something involving regulations gonna happen because like there's already been little bits of pieces like if you Google or if you use open Ai and you ask them about coal they say like you know we think that climate change is wrong yada yada or if you ask them about uh race um they say something like you know race is a social and cultural construct and you we don't we don't want to give it our opinion on this like they kind of like but they actually do insert their opinion um and I think that there's gonna be some weird [ __ ] going on where like right now like like for example they'll like say like hey we'll give you a hundred thousand dollars for 10 of your company if you build on top of our platform and there should be all these new tools but it's all going to be underlined with this like potential massive bias that open AI has and I think there's got to be some type of Regulation around it do you know what I mean yeah Andrew what you got predictions and by the way these are supposed to be when we said we said wild predictions so we're again we're not saying we're sure these are going to happen these are like sort of interesting predictions yes you remember like five years ago everyone was saying Apple doesn't innovate anymore they can't do Ai and what was happening is that Google at least historically has innovated in public so they're constantly constantly releasing new features and showing off these kind of half-baked ideas that are in their r d Labs whereas Apple has always been very opaque they'll work on something for seven years they won't share it and then all of a sudden they'll release it and I think that same thing is happening with gpt3 and AI I do believe that while right now I can say I'm using gpt3 instead of Google I think Google has probably been working on something similar for years and years and years and is probably very far ahead maybe not ahead of gpt3 necessarily but that they have their own offering and so I just think it's a those there's going to be a lot of a lot of other players in that space coming out over the next probably three to six months and that it will be there's going to be an ecosystem of offerings similar to AWS and Azure and Google Cloud I think it'll be the same thing with gpt3 Google maybe Microsoft I don't know who else cool um Sam I agree with your Elon one that's one of my predictions I think he gets canceled in a big way or one of his companies goes broke I think that is a a good wild prediction um but I'm actually not going to predict I think that yeah he he's gonna get me too'd I think yeah I feel like he already has and somehow in me already I mean he already did I mean yeah kind of I think he's uncancelable kind of given all this stuff I think people think that and then it's gonna get the number of things still gonna happen I think he's gonna They're Gonna Cancel the uncancelable um but I'm not really going to predict anything that's like the macro because a who the hell knows and B who the hell cares I'm actually going to take a page out of out of the book of uh of something we respect highly here on MFM call on your own shot so my predictions are about myself so here's my here's my predictions about myself uh I predict that this is the year that I get ripped uh I predict that I turned the corner and and not like oh I get back in shape no your boy's never been in this kind of shape so I'm gonna get ripped for the first time and uh I also believe that I'm gonna start a company that is um special I don't I don't want to put a dollar amount because these special things take time so it's not going to happen in one year but I'm gonna do I'm gonna start the thing that will be my kind of like um the thing I'm known for for a very long time the Legacy thing or the thing that you know builds the the big the big wealth the big Empire I think it's gonna happen this year so those are my predictions uh for myself for 2023 well I'm happy you called your shot I actually agree with you I think you're gonna do that too I think you're you're more than likely gonna create that company than you are get ripped but uh you're just giving me that fuel thank you for the fuel are you willing to take drugs to get ripped no I'm all natural you're unwilling to take drugs I like the liver King uh okay well then yeah then I think that you're well dude getting ripped is hard man I'm I'm pretty ripped right now and everyone keeps asking me what I did and you know what I did I just didn't eat and it's really really a pain in the butt I don't really like doing it and so I don't know like I don't think you need to be that ripped what's your definition of ripped I guess visible abs yeah you got to get to what is it 12 body fat 12 it's not you can be you can live a good life and be at 12 but below 10 where I am trying to get it it sucks I'm just hungry and cold yeah I'm not gonna do that but it'll be visible all right um let's do another one uh coolest moment of the year for you what was the coolest moment of the year uh personally that you had dude mine is like it kind of felt like we crossed a Chasm for like kind of like this podcast being well known and like that's a little I didn't want to do a selfish one honestly I almost feel free yeah I almost I wanted to say you selling the milk Road I actually did think that was cool um uh the the seeing you do that I got a lot of joy out of and a lot of like even though I wasn't involved it was like I felt a sense of pride of like we came together the advisor so you know you were involved yeah so feel free to send me some money but uh uh no I think like us getting popular this year like it really felt like this is the first time it happened I agree uh it's something has changed Andrew what about you coolest moment of the year for you so I've talked about this before but I feel like what I actually if I really am honest what I like about business aside from making money and not making my life easier is meeting interesting people and uh you know I got to know uh Andrew huberman this year and we ended up partnering so basically like I've got a foundation I've been giving a bunch of money away to science and so I met huberman maybe is that who you wrote the channel or two ago you wrote the check to science yeah yeah exactly just science but um I met huberman like a year or two ago and basically we did this thing where when people subscribed to his premium podcast a bunch of the money goes to um basically funding science and research that he wants to fund and I basically said look I'll double I'll double every single dollar that you donate and so we've got this partnership and I just love that kind of stuff where would you I can work with some people I respect benefactor do something that I think is good so that's a cool moment you've become a benefactor you get to use one of these words that's like from the 1800s when you do things like that yeah it feels good it's fun dude and plus you have an excuse now to hang out with the dreamiest guy on Earth Andrew huberman yeah totally say I'm jealous anytime you want um for sure all right my coolest moment of the year was you were there for this Sam when we were at Camp MFM and we got to go do a tour of uh of Duke's uh basketball stadium and we're in there and then we uh we're sitting down gave they gave us the talk it was an art it was a good experience at that point but we had a there's a moment that made it a good experience to like a keystone memory which was when I bet Mr Beast ten thousand dollars that I could hit a shot from half court and I hit it and the whole thing on number on number five or something yeah like the third third attempt hit I was like I'll again hit this before you the third attempt I hit it it's on camera it was it was an amazing fun moment it made that that trip a little bit more more special and memorable did he ever pay you this is where it comes this is where it gets interesting it's also actually my biggest L of the year because he didn't pay me and then I had to follow up and I followed up two times three times and now I'm basically begging for the money by the third time you go from like first time you kind of crack it you're busting balls a little bit like hey [ __ ] baby and then the second time you're like hey man uh didn't pay by the time it's the third one now this awesome dope moment has turned into an L because now I'm having to go yeah I think I think I think you need to take him to small claims exactly that's how I'm doing that via iMessage and I was like we have it on video we have the bed up dude we have the bet on video no I know and so this this baller moment of confidence of being like hey betcha 10 grand I can hit the shot and then actually hitting it uh with you know everybody there in the center of you know cameras Cameron Stadium Cameron Indoor Stadium turned into a bit of a small boy moment of being like hey hey um hey did you have a chance to hey just I know you're busy just uh do you think you can I'll send the details again maybe maybe it's on my end dude is he lying about every other uh donation he's ever no coffeezilla get on it are there thousands of victims like me that's crazy I can't believe you didn't pay you he doesn't seem like someone who would he blamed his assistant he's like oh [ __ ] sorry my assistant I'm gonna uh I'm gonna have to yell at him yeah right okay let's do um let's do the craziest most delusional person of the year that we met this one's for for us it's probably easy it's Billy McFarland did you hear that oh did you hear that interview Sean or uh Andrew no I did I didn't hear it I don't like when you guys interview people like that because I I know I know it's like interesting and stuff but I feel like if you if only even if only five percent of people hear that and go hey he actually sounds like a good guy I just think like he's gonna go and [ __ ] more people over I don't know what do you guys think I I didn't and uh we do those bad things he goes and listens to all in instead he doesn't listen to the episode he goes on strike Sean Hall hardly disagrees with you I think yeah I totally disagree I think uh you know this podcast is our vehicle to have conversations with interesting people and everybody's an adult they should judge for themselves whether they think this person's full of [ __ ] or deserves a second chance or whatever on the Pod itself he told us what he was doing and literally with a one pause I just go that's a horrible idea and I actually felt bad that I was that brutal about it uh but it really was I thought a horrible idea and I felt the need to just like say it so um I think it's one thing if you invite them on and they just like like I see this sometimes people just like suck up to people and the other is to be like dude what the hell were you thinking or they're like oh you know I just thought this like are you serious like really you like are you gonna look at me with a straight face and say that this was all just an honest mistake like you had to have known right so I think as long as you are real with your questions uh then it's all good but that's my you know it's my opinion I just think I just think it's like um it's giving air time to people that are bad right like I would say Billy McFarland is probably a psychopath right but the Bernie mate obviously documentary on Netflix coming out in three days are you gonna watch that Bernie Madoff is dead if I if you had if you had Bernie Madoff on your podcast and you were like hey so like what happened tell us your story and even if you kind of call him out if he's like a belief like a real psychopath is like pretty charming and like believable and you listen to them and there's going to be a percentage of people that hear that and the difference with Madoff is he's in jail right the then like Billy McFarland again I have no idea you know he he served his time sure but like he's probably gonna go on and do more sketchy [ __ ] or I don't know any of these people who have a pattern of behavior of doing Psychopathic fraudulent stuff I just don't think they should get any air time frankly yeah okay fair enough I think there's a lot of people who would agree with you uh I don't personally but most most probably do but I actually I'm partially on Sean's side I am mostly on Sean's side but I I do feel guilt sometimes like there's another person who Sean wants to have on that I think there's not a chance we should uh but uh so imagine here's here's how I would tell you to think about this like imagine that you so you know Sam you've told me stories of guys who I remember you told me there was some average Advertiser who is [ __ ] you over and not paying you and you felt very cheated and Sean I mean that guy that you sued who you felt like was chiseling you the landlord or whatever now let's say I have a podcast and I say well there's two sides to every story and he's fascinating I'm gonna go have that guy on my podcast as the victim you'd be like what the [ __ ] that question I would say ask that question as long as you actually ask the questions and you uh you're not just giving them like a chance to lie or say BS in a way that's like it's obviously BS but you let them skate on it um like that's what happened with like Sam bakeries yeah but look at look at Tai Lopez look at Tai Lopez Tai Lopez got legitimized by being on MFM a lot of people heard him and went you know what he's not a bad guy and you know Sam kind of likes him and whatever and like what has he been doing over the last wait wait wait what did I do I didn't do anything you said you're you were like yeah I met him I met him in a hotel and he was actually a really nice guy right and it's like of course he is he's just is charming I like everyone I like to respect the audience and meaning I believe that it you should have the opportunity to hear it and make your own decision I don't pretend that I'm your parent and I'm legitimizing them or I'm telling you they're good or bad or whatever I'm just letting you see them and if you see them and you decide that they're great great if you decide that we didn't ask tough questions and you can't make a decision but Andrew you promote uh you promote Bill Ackman sure like I absolutely do he's my business person and I'm not saying I actually don't know all the details how could you put them in the same category well a lot of I'm not saying I do but a lot of people do don't they Andrew like that's objective you can actually you can at least say that like a lot of people do think that he's uh what did Bill actually do that's on on considered controversy oh yeah what did he do exactly that would be like fraudulent or something like that always made some Investments that have turned out badly but he's never I don't think he's predatory in any way I think Bill is a great individualism I've seen the person you know legitimate is when he went on what's the MLM and he was like I uh the whole markets he basically was like hell is coming blah blah but didn't disclose it he had basically a giant short position yeah maybe caused a panic maybe didn't no but he he had already if he actually look he wrote a letter about this he'd already sold almost his entire position he had like one or two percent left and I spoke to Bill two weeks before that and he was freaking the [ __ ] out like similar benefit greatly if people started selling right he had a giant no sure no he actually made a bunch of money he wasn't no no no no that I think it's a big misunderstanding if you actually look at the Timeline he'd already sold out of that position what about uh Herbalife Herbalife I mean Herbalife he went out and he said this is a multi-level marketing scheme and what ended up happening is the FTC investigated it and they gave them a 200 million dollar fine and they got up to the point of saying hey is this an ml they settled with them for like 200 million it was the largest uh FTC fine ever and Herbalife the FTC commissioner was asked is Herbalife a multi-level marketing pyramid scheme and she said it's not not one right because she was legally Bound by not calling it that so basically bill was right and that was an instance where he lost a shitload of money trying to fight a bad guy did that really happen by the way I'm not saying Bill Ackman sucks I think I'm I'm I like Bill but you're not I know no that's not that's not what I'm applying I'm I'm saying that some people maybe think that he's full of it right I I think yes absolutely there's people that are critical I think there's a great quote on this I'm not saying he is the tallest the tallest blade of grass is the first to get cut and I think Bill is very loud and he is always confident and he's usually right but not always and so someone like that I think when they're not right everyone loves to [ __ ] all over them yeah yeah I'm not saying that I don't think he's in the category where he's got like you know there I don't know of any accusations about stuff like that I think some people are just like he's not as good he loses money he's not as good if an investor as he says or his his Fame would lead you to believe that's a criticism but that's like any that's like that's like criticizing someone's Skittle LeBron James is not as good as Michael Jordan or whatever right like that's different than saying somebody is you know I think it's like it's like fixating on Warren Buffett buying Dexter's shoe and it not working out and then saying or you know Warren Buffett did some deals in his early career where he bought a business and he ended up having to lay a lot of people off right now you could build a narrative that well Warren but everyone says Warren Buffett's so great but what about this and what about this but if you look at it and there's a hundred Investments and 10 of them didn't go well you know you can fixate on the 10 but you can look at the long-term performance bills compounded at 20 plus percent I think 25 or something crazy uh maybe not quite that but something exceptional so again like he's my business partner obviously I'll defend him I'm not by the way yeah I don't think he's anywhere are near those guys I'm not saying I'm not saying I think he sucks I actually like him a lot from what I read about him I'm just saying my point being is a lot of people a lot of awesome people have haters and just because you have a lot of haters doesn't necessarily mean I don't think you should we shouldn't have you on that's my whole point but imagine okay you guys have a newspaper right effectively you guys own the New York Times of tech startup Bros right like that that's what that's what MFM is you guys have this huge audio quote you on that would it be ethical for the editor editor of the New York Times to put an op-ed from Bernie Madoff on the front cover right it was not an op-ed it's an interview it's a big big difference again I hear I totally I totally agree I hear you guys I know you want to like stir the pot and it's good good listening I just for me like I just hate when these weasels get okay let's get back yeah let's move on all right Andrew who's the most delusional person you've met this year so okay so it's a delusional person who I think is amazing um you guys probably will say the same person it's Brian Johnson uh I met Brian almost a year ago and I remember sitting down with him and looking just looking at him he's like a translucent glowing Twilight vampire like he just looks if you cut his arm off there's circuits under there I and he's so incredibly well spoken and like like you I Sam I think you said he's like the the Elon but like behind the scenes and quiet right it's special I think he's amazing uh I think he's like he's like dedicating his life to basically being a test uh you know a test case for the rest of us so I really admire him uh and I think he's really how do you look in person did he look uh on our pot he almost looked he almost looked a little ill like he was so skinny yeah he was so pale that there was no pigment in his skin like literally like literally looked like um what's that movie uh with the [ __ ] what is it uh the robot guy alien alien with the robot guy like just totally pale humanoid that's uh that's my pick too uh Brian Johnson for the for the exact same reason so we'll we'll move to the next one uh he was he was you're right crazy and delusional in the best way possible um yeah as a mean that as a compliment um okay did you guys have another category that you really like your answer for does anybody like think they got something good because we can just go to those the the relationship hacks and the um what you got so um they always say like the best first date is an adrenaline kind of event right so like you want to go on a hike you want to get your heart pounding maybe you go and do like a ropes you know those uh what are they called they're like rope swings through the forest whatever like something that gets your heart pounding because when someone Associates you with a peak experience like a physical feeling of peak experience that's very positive and it bonds you and the same thing is true with alcohol so I I kind of stopped drinking um maybe like seven or eight years ago and I've kind of mourned the ability to go and you know down a pint with someone because they always end up telling you everything they tell you about their business and the problems they're having and you know what's going on with their wife it's like hang out once drunk is like hanging out 10 times times sober and so what I've been doing is I've been been inviting people that I would otherwise have like a meeting with over to my house and we'll do a really long sauna and a cold plunge and I've been finding like I just feel so incredibly bonded to people because I'm having like my body is pumped full of all these endogenous drugs uh and it's been really good it's been kind of like drinking with someone dude can I tell you what mine was here's I'm gonna read let me word re read it word for word invite people have them come over for dinner and cook for them and we take ice baths together after dinner before dinner what are you doing before do you tell them some trucks or how do you prepare are you just spray it on them or or sometimes sometimes they're just spraying on them and I have a towel already and I have shorts and it's so funny that that's exactly what mine is another relationship hack that I have is I bring my wife to almost everything so so it feels like a family a gathering and also she's like like hot and like well like well read and like can have a discussion so it automatically makes me seem better you're the guy with the hot book smart wife oh yeah I bet uh uh yeah so Adrian I had the same thing another thing that I that I typically don't do and I and I think this is the worst way to hang out is while exercising I hate when people say let's go get a workout together I'm like I don't want to I never want to do that ever I will never do a workout and hang out yeah I want silence same I'm the opposite I love love a workout together that's a great it's a great idea I've had multiple listeners from the Pod be like hey I'm in town uh winter workout like I'll just come swing by and we'll just do it together and I was like oh that's perfect I don't want to separately beat you and uh I'll learn so much about you just seeing how you work out that this is uh like how you deal with like you know adversity like you know how you're how are you as a hang you know do you work out like all these things it's a great tell all right I got two little hacks the first is a principle that I've had for a long time it's called don't attend the party host the party this is my um I have a rule I don't attend other people's events typically unless it's a real good friend who really wants me to but I will host so um I think hosting is it is let's say five times the work but I think it's 500 times the payoff uh when you actually host the the event so we uh Camp MFM is a perfect example of this uh and when you host it um the other the other hack in this is make it epic because it's going to be more fun for you to it's like all the logistical work is kind of the same but if you just use your creativity to make it a more interesting people will come and they'll have like a whole memory to you know a whole experience uh with you so with Camp MFM the way we did it where we flew to this place we had the basketball trainer Mr Beast and Hassan were there like interesting people were there we all stayed in you know an Airbnb a giant house together like that was a instead of just doing a networking event we made it fun and we made it different and I think I know you get a bunch of benefits of being the one who hosted it that's the first one the second one I would say the actual relationship hack with with my wife is so I'm a pretty chill dude but I do I do have one Achilles heel which is I'm very very very impatient and what that means is like you know my wife is like slow to leave the house trying to go somewhere it's like oh dude why does this take so I feel like I've wasted half my life waiting to leave the house um you know just with kids it gets like really slow so I've always had this impatience thing and I've tried to be like all right I'm gonna be more patient I'm gonna be more patient and I realized that that was actually a Fool's errand that the way to be more patient for me is to get in a fight in the morning and what I started doing was I hired this MMA trainer and I would wake up early I do my workout in the morning and I would Spar and what I found is that if I Spar in the morning I've gotten a really hard strenuous like endorphin kick you know done the rest of the day I'm just sort of like yo it's whatever like I I can wait yeah you can take take an extra 10 minutes uh you want to change your shirt because maybe this one's a little maybe a little too hot it's like go ahead go change your shirt yeah no problem I'll be here at the front door chilling and I have become such a more patient person just by doing a sparring session in the morning it's a pretty extreme step to take but it is so far the only thing that has gotten me to change this like really terrible personality trait after so long nothing like getting punched in the face I was I I think I told you that you did tell me that and the other experience I had like this was I've been skydiving once in the morning and the rest of the day you could stress me out if you tried I was in I was a completely immune to stress and so I think there's something to this like having a very exhilarating or adrenaline kick in the morning it just makes the rest of the day completely non-stressful that doesn't mean you don't do anything it just means you don't stress we were talking about the cold plunges and um I was just listening to a huberman lab and he was talking about this exact thing so when you're in cold it obviously stresses your body you get a huge dopamine Spike and you get adrenaline norepinephrine all that kind of stuff and he was saying that if you do stressful things while you're in the cold plunge it adapts you to dealing with stress better so you should definitely get a cold plunge and then argue with your wife while you're in it or something sounds smart uh so that's best religion pack what's the what was the other one you said uh oh favorite tool or product under what it's favorite uh tool or product under a thousand dollars what you guys got so I always have this problem um I'll travel to a city and I'll try and think of you know I'll be like okay I'm going to New York on this day who do I know in New York and it'll be whoever's top of Mind whoever I've just been texting with or something and I'll go and I'll have a couple meetings and then I'll leave and then I'll remember you know it's like when you leave the grocery store and you realize there's like three or four important things you forgot I always realize oh [ __ ] I forgot to meet all these people I really wanted to see and so um I've tried a couple different tools for this but I found one I really liked it's this one called clay it's a personal CRM which we all hate I know it's like a horrible business but um they do a really good job of basically tapping into your Twitter your LinkedIn your iMessage all the pla your email all the places where you contact me and this is uh Earth clay.earth yeah and so basically it's a huge database of all the people you know and so what I do now is I go in clay and I'll just be like I'll type in New York and it'll show me everyone in New York and then I don't miss people uh and that's been huge this is a beautiful website yeah I turn right away because it helps us like uh same problem with all crms for me where like you get out what you put in and I'm just not willing to put it put it enough but there's no I don't use it like I don't you I don't update it it's just when I go traveling it's just a database of people I know and where they live can I uh mine is my body tutor and I don't know if Sean that if that's yours as well but have you heard about my body tutor Andrew no very simple all right here's what it is I spent 600 a month and every day my coach her name's Heather calls me and says what are you gonna eat today and I tell her and she's those yesterday according to your MyFitnessPal you ate this this and this this thing was bad how'd that make you feel and I say I feel horrible I'm not going to do it again today and she just shames me or educates me on why I made a good or bad decision and we like work backwards from whichever goal I want it's it's a five minute phone call uh that's been the bit the best tool I've ever used that's a good one that's all it is I um so I'm a pretty disorganized guy so my favorite tools or products have been the one that helped me get organized and I got two that kind of save my ass this year um I don't know Sam did you when you were at the hustle did you ever have like a bookkeeper yes and do you remember life before a bookkeeper and a life after bookkeeper before it's stressful and like now I know that like I didn't know what the difference between revenue and cash flow was and I didn't like understand like that like you take expenses and you like I'm amortize them I didn't understand all that stuff so it was as if I was driving at night time without headlights on the perfect way to describe it that's how I've been my whole life and I would always wonder man how do these other people have their [ __ ] together how is it you know tax season comes around I'm just like scrambling and it's like the worst version of cramming for a test and so this year I basically totally revamp my financial like hygiene game with a bookkeeper and a tax person that I love and I'm gonna shout them both out because they're amazing uh they were they were so amazing I did invest in both of the companies because I was like I have to like you know I I believe in this uh you know because they saved my ass so one is called Kick so I think it's kick.co is the URL and it's basically if you go to the website I like their tagline it says self-driving bookkeeping so basically what they do is they just say connect your bank your credit cards and it's like everything it's like your Amazon you just click connect connect connect boom it's all your books and then they have bookkeeper and she calls me and she's like here's how you're doing like here's how you're pacing here's what you know here's some things you should be thinking about here's how we can save you money um you know blah blah blah and not like not like spend less but more like tax wise like here's some things that you could do and so bookkeeping was the first one uh and then how much is this all my books are together it's super cheap it's like I don't know it's like 99 or 100 199 a month or something like that it's like if anybody if you're a Creator like the one big thing is they they do this for like kind of like small small businesses like sort of like LLC types s Corps or um creators so like if you're a YouTuber or twitch Creator or a podcaster uh most of them have don't treat their creator business like a business and you totally should it is a business and I think also the law has now changed so starting next year I think they have to do like the quarterly estimated taxes and things like that like dude 99 of the creators have no idea what this stuff is or how to do it and so um so I love this thing this has been like kind of a game changer for me out of having my my p l my cash flow my balance sheet all of it just like very clean and then then that gets handed to the other service gelt and so but guilt does is kind of amazing I don't know how much of this I'm supposed to say are allowed to say it I don't even think they want me shouting it out because it's like dude I just signed it I just signed up I just signed up with gel uh are you on the waitlist are you you actually started using it I dm'd him and I have a call set up so the guy tal is this incredible guy he's an entrepreneur so but for the best thing so I've I've met many I've had many like kind of accountants and Tech strategy people and I literally walked in and I felt like I was walking into a meeting like you know with CIA or something like that with IRS it's like and and Nick Hoover said this right he goes yeah dude 95 of accountants and tax strategy people they're like they act like government agents and he's like you can't even he's like you're just asking questions like how should I structure this differently in order to and they can't answer it's like they're not creative first of all so they're not even giving you ideas it's like if you have the idea they can say yes or no but it's like dude where am I supposed to come up with all these ideas from uh so like they don't give you ideas first of all and secondly they're like well did you spend more than 22 hours doing this it's like dude I don't know I wasn't keeping track of that but like if I say yes what happens if I say no what happens I need to understand like could you just disarm this it's not even like help me cheat it's like literally just don't make this stressful it's been my big problem with this and so guilt is kind of amazing because towels he's a Founder he's an entrepreneur he sold his last company and he's like dude I just like he's like personally I just hated taxes and so I decided to create like the tax firm I wish existed and they're amazing so the same thing they take your books and then what they do is they're more like yo have you thought about structuring your corporations in this way because then you can get the advantage of qsbs while still maintaining this advantage and like they they do everything clean they do everything by the book but they are they feel more like your friend helping you do this than the other way and so these guys probably save me I don't know I don't know how much to save me but I wouldn't be surprised if it was seven figures of what I've saved using this thing um and it's the first time I've been not stressed on the subject of finding like bookkeeping and taxes and so like that has been like a very nice feeling for me to have versus like this scramble and always feeling like there was some adult class that I missed I slept through and now here's the test like that's how that's how taxes always felt for me was I slept through the class and everybody else took it everybody else is prepared and I don't know what the [ __ ] I'm doing and now finally I feel like okay I I have my notes to take this test dude I think it's one of the one of those things that's shocking how many business people just don't know how to read a balance sheet and a p l and cash flow statement and it's if you want to learn Khan Academy has an amazing introductory course takes about an hour and you'll learn everything you need to do you guys hear this the IRS hired like some like some absurd number of new Auditors was it like 18 000 if you're like 80 000 or or more I don't know like IRS hiring new agents I think they hired 80 000 um 87 000 new hires and so I think there's gonna be a [ __ ] little audit which is why I wanted to be like super buttoned up with everything um just because oh man that's another time suck if you get audited of like dealing with all that crap so uh you know I don't think they hire these people to do nothing it's 80 billion 80 billion in new funding and 87 000 tax agents isn't that insane that's [ __ ] crazy they're gonna have a lot of work to cut out for them um I think we should almost wrap up we have we want to do one one or two yeah let's do one or two more what are your favorite ones yeah let's do let's do one what's a really good one what about biggest change adjustment you're making yeah I have one go Sam so um for I have a new thing that I'll launch that it's live but I'll announce it later um I'm hiring a CEO for it I've already like done that and I've never done that early on I also am doing close to like I'm being less of a dictator and I'm also being less metrics driven this sounds like the freaking douchiest thing ever but I'll say it but more like Vibe and energy driven uh basically with the hustle and like my last company I was like by the book where it was like all right I want to see projections we're going to nail it we're gonna like the metrics say this therefore like I can see you putting a metric on the vibe too like we're in 87 on five this week guys well like on my last like for all my companies I'm like look you've got to do this many outbound calls like we're gonna like whatever the a b metric is this is what it is uh like we're going with a that A1 and I just filed the data and I was like I don't care and then it was very much a dictatorship where I said my rule or my way or the highway and I'm trying to be a little bit calmer for my next thing and I think I'll make way more money that way that's a great one great adjustment uh Andrew what you got biggest change or adjustment you're making in your business life 2023 so last year I don't know if I said this but my big goal was conquering email like I just I was overwhelmed by it it was stressing me out and so now I've built a system I've fully delegated it I've got someone dedicated to managing my email and so I really only get 10 or 15 emails that I have to respond to and everything else is triaged and responded to and dealt with so I've conquered email the problem is now I get a lot of iMessages like texts and stuff and I'm going I don't know how to conquer that other than changing my number which seems [ __ ] up um I'm trying to figure that out if anyone has any ideas please tweet at me because um there's it seems like there's no way if someone has your number they're going to get to you and I have a really hard time not responding to text I feel kind of guilty um so I'd love to hear you're just getting like cold texts from strangers is that the problem dude I get so many of those not that it's just there's I mean I get cold text for sure but it's more just like there's so many people I've given my number out to and if someone doesn't get an email response to me sometimes they'll try and go there I think like some people have found my number online like it's just it's just becoming too much and I'll be like with email you can kind of turn it off I'll be putting my kids down for bed and like reading a Kindle book on my phone and I'll be getting hit up with text and it's just the ability to break into your Consciousness would you just get a new number sucks yeah I was thinking about it but I've had my number since I was like 15. it feels messed up to do I know but I've thought about doing that as well Sam uh okay so you did yours Andrew you did yours my biggest adjustment um you knowing when to use my impulsiveness so I am an extremely impulsive person um and that works in like eight out of ten situations one of the situations it doesn't work in is I'm very impulsive with picking businesses to start and yeah I will just like start a business like instantaneously and I will go and I'll start making it happen and it's really fun and that wave and that Thrill is so addictive and then 11 months later I'm like okay now I have this business um was this the business that I wanted to have was because like I can't do that many of these at the same time uh so is this the right are you happy you started your Ecom thing um no if I could go back and just pick a different project I would um same thing with the milk Road part of the reason I sold it was I was like I don't think this was the project that I want to work on every year um you know for the next three years and so if I don't want to work on it for the next three years I should just sell it now and like you know uh if I have a good offer like take it um but that's kind of a shitty feeling like there's a celebration in selling but there's also a bit of a failure it's like I've been saying this for a while I want to work on a project that I don't want to sell like this podcast time has flown by where this is the third year we're doing the Millie awards that means this Friday is at least three years old um I can keep going I would do this for free I was doing this for free I was going to do this at a loss so this is the right type of project for me to do it's one that I would literally do if there was no money involved I don't count the days or the hours I'm not stressed about the metrics I know it's going to keep going up because we'll just keep trying to do a better and better job I have fun doing it and it's not a not a drag on my lifestyle right like perfect project this has been the only project I've selected correctly on I would argue every single business I've started since the age of 21 was the wrong pick and it was always just the impulsive pick it was someone should do this dude I bet I could do that dude I would just do this as this all right let me just do it and I would just do it and then you know sure enough I'm look looking for the exit later because it wasn't really the right project so I'm trying to find the big changes I'm going to find the project that's in my zone of Genius um that is the perfect project for me it's what I enjoy doing um and I'm not building it for some future payoff I'm building it I'm doing it because I like doing it that it is the the project that's you know I'm most interested in and if that changes later okay that's fine I'm not saying I have to do it till I'm 99 years old but um I'm not doing it just kind of like on a whim so I'm going to be patient and select the project properly that's good it's about time I've been telling you that for 10 years the best lessons are the ones that you have to relearn 10 10 times over okay so the other one was best business idea yeah do you guys dude yeah let's end up tell me why your washer and your dryer are two different machines remember to put my wet clothes into the dryer it's ridiculous this needs to be one that's honestly that is one of the smartest actually a really good point it's it's crazy to me it's crazy to me that it's two different things that that actually exists no it's in it's in Best Buy Home Depot they're not that great it's a thing they're not that great yet like I use them in Europe and they're only okay but they need to be the norm this needs to be the norm yeah yeah if you're working on AI or crypto or self-driving cars quit and figure this one out like we gotta put we gotta have our priorities in order you know how many people are wasting time dude like it's like look at James Dyson look at James Dyson he's worth 18 billion dollars and he just was like vacuums are terrible I'm gonna rethink those I mean he could have been working on AI but no you chose something prior machine next to our dishwasher machine thank you I agree dude like some of the or like uh or like have you ever noticed how the inside of a refrigerator no matter how rich you are it always looks like [ __ ] like we need like a better organizer or something for like so some of these like day-to-day problems I think need to be improved particularly we'll start with the washer and dryer it needs to be one machine okay I like that one Andrew um so mine I tweeted about this um so there's all these private jets out there flying around all over the world and uh tell me about it um people people will people will fly somewhere and they don't need a return flight or they're gonna go there for two weeks or three weeks or whatever and so the plane actually flies back empty just with the pilots on it right and I think this is truly insane this is like billions of dollars getting lit on fire every month of just jet fuel and empty planes and stuff I don't know what the solution is I know there's people that have tried this um but it seems like a incredibly inefficient disjointed uh world and someone needs to crack this and create a central database of basically every plane that's available because let's think about who owns private jets it's very very rich people very rich people are usually business people and are logical do they care about having someone else fly back if it pays for all the fuel and stuff probably not maybe like Gucci where it's like well I don't want to like sell my unsold Gucci clothes I'd rather just burn them to keep the value up sure yeah I don't know maybe but anyway I do think there's a lot of people who would certainly uh want to get compensated for that if it was easy and I think someone needs to crack this yeah that's a that's a good one um okay I'm gonna go with the school for the starving artist okay so I've met a lot of people in life who like to do different artsy things you know photography film uh you know met somebody who was like you know they like they're like oh yeah I fell in love with photography because I would hang up the freaking prints and like let them dry like whatever you know whatever that [ __ ] is uh you know coloring you know blah blah drawing there's all these aren't artistic things and I would say most people give up on those passions or things because it's really really hard to make a living doing it or is it that's what I want to answer because now that I'm doing this Ecom thing I now pay a lot of money to photographers it's just that they had to be branded as photographers who understand how to do product photography or commercial photo shoots um my wife when she was in business school was just doodling on her paper board and somebody walked by and luckily they saw that and they go did you draw that and she was like oh yeah sorry uh I'm paying attention I promise he's like no no I don't care like but if you can draw that I have a job for you it's called graphic facilitation you can make a thousand dollars a day just by going to these meetings and conferences for these businesses and you draw on a giant whiteboard what they're talking about so they have a visual takeaway at the end of it and she made more money than me for a long time doing this thing she would have never known how to turn her art into money and so I think somebody should create an art school for people who have artistic talents but want to be rich uh for have our discounts but they want to make a living doing it and not just be a starving artist for their whole life I think you should create a specific school for this and all the courses are things where you take an artistic trait but you teach them how to do it in the commercial way and they can make money even while they're in school doing this like you know how big of a shortage there is of video editors now that YouTube and Tick Tock are so huge or you know again commercial photography or drawing or all these different different uh artistic things so I think somebody should create the school for The Starving Artists where they're no they're not going to starve anymore and uh get the get the artists that are willing to sell out like 25 and just like do this like you see this girl on Tick Tock she does these she'll take like a uh like Dr Pepper will pay her like a million dollars to this Tick Tock where she does these like crazy slo-mo zoom in water dripping on the side and she makes this epic like like video trailer of a Dr Pepper she makes a Dr Pepper look like it's the unveiling of a new you know rocket by SpaceX and she's just really talented at that and brands are willing to pay her for

one of the hardest businesses I own a bakery in Victoria BC where I live and I bought it because I'd rather had grown up working there it was a Neighborhood Place the owner wanted to sell and I've owned it for about five or six years you have to have about 40 or 50 employees someone has to wake up at two in the morning and go into the basement of the bakery and bake croissants and the amount of coordination that has to go right where if a couple people are sick how messed up the business can be it's just night and day compared to any internet business

the company that we talked about where we said oh we met this girl she was a college student at NYU they got they did that Clubhouse thing where they did shoot your shot and I met her and I was like wow you're a star I don't know what this idea is she was doing like some web 3 version of The Bachelor I was like oh that's a terrible idea but this is hey that's okay this is your terrible idea you're gonna do amazing things I think they might have already pivoted into something kind of amazing or found something amazing under their umbrella and it's these shows so the watch one has in in four weeks 14 million views 2 million likes and a total budget of I think two thousand dollars 100 190 000 followers [Music] foreign we're live brother it's been dry for me not a lot of research and ideas going on are you the same dry season it's dry season yeah I um I know what you mean but um I can't say I relate because your boy's wet really you have stuff Andre's dripping with Concepts you know actually I have all the stuff prepared and then like typically in the four hours before we record I just come up with a whole different set of things that I want to talk about the first one is okay so I don't know the full back story of this but I I do think it's kind of cool so I saw a tweet that basically said there's like five 21 year olds who are building you know some Next Generation Media company uh okay what are you guys doing well basically it took him one month and they launched a series of original Tick Tock shows so not just like themselves on Tick Tock but an actual show so there's one show called buying time it's where they buy and sell watches like kind of like on the Fly um and you get to see them like buy or sell negotiate the watch what's the name of the company so the name of the company what is their name um I thought it was related to that mad realities thing it might be it's gonna say it sounds like that I think it is related to them I'll I'll try to try to go find it yeah it is it's either produced by them it's theirs or they're like in the network I'm not sure but they're in in their bio for all the shows it's at mad realities right so that the brand that we the the company that we talked about where we said oh we met this girl she was a college student at NYU they got they did that Clubhouse thing where they did shoot your shot and I met her and I was like wow you're a star I don't know what this idea is she was doing like some web 3 version of The Bachelor I was like oh that's a terrible idea but this is hey that's okay this is your terrible idea you're gonna do amazing things I think they might have already pivoted into something kind of amazing or found something amazing under their umbrella and it's these shows so the watch one has in in four weeks 14 million views two million likes and a total budget of I think two thousand dollars 190 000 followers and what are they doing on the show and does that two by the way some of these numbers might be a little off we we got we got Brandon the researcher he's running on the hamster wheel in the back here he's trying to get all the data but sometimes I mess up kind of reading his data so so numbers are directional for anything I ever say okay um but I did watch this other one keep the meter running so keep reader running's cool you'll like this concept they get in a cab in New York and the guy's like all right where are you trying to go and he's like uh where do you like to go in New York why don't you take me there I've seen this it's so good he's like take me to your favorite favorite place you know let's go eat uh you want lunch have you eaten today and the guy's like no I I don't need to end of my shift he's like let's go take me to your favorite spot he's like okay he's again just keep the meter running and they basically drive to like you know the little the like Halal Town part of New York to get out and you hear this story he's like he's like leave the meter running they go inside they eat he asks them about his kids and his life and how he ended up with a taxi does he like it and they're just enjoying a meal and they just do that the whole day uh also 2.4 million likes 160 000 followers budget it's really really great man that's a really great have you seen it I've seen it it's like um if humans of New York was a tick tock show and um and so they definitely find some gems of like human beings and you're just like by the end of it you're just like I just love this dude I just want this like taxi driver to have an easier life and it's a great show she's happy too which is the best part it's not it doesn't make you feel guilty because they're sad they're very happy and content with a simple life and most of the people who are watching Tick Tock have like 10 times more going for them than this guy and are 10 times less happy and you know discontent of scrolling Tick Tock basically at the time so it's like one of those things that makes you feel good it's a feel-good show then they have this other one called Einstein Elementary it's basically this guy he calls himself the Einstein of Wall Street it kind of looks like Einstein got gray hair puffing out to the side and he just explains stock market [ __ ] in like simple terms and this one has a million likes and a hundred thousand followers and I'm just like this is really really cool they are basically prototyping these shows that could be produced into real shows or this might be it um and the reason I wanted to bring this up is because a 21 year olds doing cool [ __ ] love it B if you think about like what's the next Generation like you know you worked on that show or worked with a guy from American Pickers or like there's all these like random Niche shows right it's like yeah these guys they go into [ __ ] storage units and they like you know they have to cook a meal out of what's in there yeah who the [ __ ] out of this why am I watching this for two two and a half hours um those shows are going to happen on tick tock not TV and they're gonna happen like a thousand fold you're gonna get a thousand times more experiments just using Tick Tock the second thing is I have this framework that I learned from it by Buddy Sully which was the doors versus Windows so when I saw this I was like huh they got like you know millions of views but they kind of don't make any money and it kind of goes away so I don't really see the opportunity and at first I kind of wrote it off like yeah that's the problem with Tick Tock man you can get you can pop off but like then what so what and I think that's so what drives away a lot of people but there's another part of me that's like of course this is valuable of course if you created a show that people like and millions of people watch it there's going to be value there on this platform that's growing and taking over like the entire social media it's like the fastest growing company in the world uh of course you being one of the fastest growing channels on the fastest growing up you know media app is a is a very valuable thing it's just not clear exactly what that value is how you'll capture it and in a few years it'll be like wow this person makes a hundred million dollars off Tick Tock that's crazy right the same way we say about Mr Beast on YouTube and people on Twitch oh ninja makes how many millions of dollars on Twitch that's crazy just for playing video games and to me this is a Windows versus doors thing when the analogy goes like this most people only want to work for window on window opportunities window opportunities where you could see straight through you can see what's the value on the other side and you see what's inside then you can open up open the window or break the window whatever hop in and take the value what a door opportunity is like a door is opaque you can't see what's on the other side you know there's probably something but you don't see exactly what it is and it's good to go for window opportunities because you can see exactly what's there but it is bad to be the type of person who only will do things and only take massive effort on window opportunities and you never go knock on doors and when you knock on doors it's because uh 90 of other people have just walked by because they don't know what's inside they don't they don't want to make the effort and I think this is a doors opportunity where people on Tick Tock are going to get way bigger than most people realize they're going to figure out how to make money even in these like 15 seconds of Fame moments that they're having and huge brands are going to be built this way and I just think it's a door opportunity we haven't we haven't heard the five success stories you need to hear before it becomes a gold rush and everybody starts to copy it that's true I think though in some regard you uh like I work in media industry so do you like it's a pretty like tried and true method of like getting an audience and making money through advertising so I have faith that they'll figure it out the thing that a lot of these companies where they screw up there's basically I've been thinking a lot about this but there's like one or two mistakes that you can make and well I mean I've thought of one or two mistakes that you can make in business that are like basically irreversible so most decisions are reversible not all but most and a few that are not is if you screw up your cap table and you raise too much money and you have a company like BuzzFeed that makes like 350 million in Revenue maybe like 50 million in Prof profit I think their market cap is a hundred and fifty million right now because uh like they're like I don't know how they're gonna you know I don't know how the markets work like this but they're never gonna like live up to the hype that they once had of like 5 billion or whatever it is same with uh like bird scooter bird scooter maybe not a horrible company did you see what their market cap is today it's like 70 million or something right what is it no 40. 40 million dollars wow 40 million dollars and so a company like this like this house is worth more than bird isn't that crazy the founder the founder owns house the founder bought a 20 million dollar house isn't that nuts like the hustle was basically almost worth more than bird and bird Soul or raised I think like a billion dollars right to be fair the hustle was way cooler than bird I mean hey dude scooters littered all over the city like I [ __ ] with that you know I I like riding a scooter oh nice we got your socks on but the the point being with this with this person's business they could I think they could kill it as long as they don't raise too much money because if they do then I think that they're gonna they're gonna die and it's gonna be horrible did I ever tell you the story about Elizabeth Murdoch calling me no what was it so the week the hustle launched I wrote this blog post saying that we launched and I get a call a cough and it was this Australian lady she goes hi this is Elizabeth Murdock and I knew right away who that was but I was like wait like Rupert's daughter like the owner of Fox Liz yeah I was like Liz what's what's up what are you doing Colleen she goes hey I saw your blog post and I think what you're doing is really cool I uh I think she said either she's launching or she already launched this company called uh I think it was called vertical networks and it was exactly this thing where she goes uh basically I negotiated a deal with Snapchat and uh they asked me to make content for them so I'm funding people to make content and you seem kind of like a loose canon who's pretty funny uh can I like I don't remember I don't want to put words in her mouth but she was like can I buy you or like fund you and you just make content for us on Snapchat and I was like huh that's interesting so I get in touch with like the guy running the company his name's Tom he's awesome and he was like Yeah so basically just like move here and just start making content all day for Snapchat and I was like I don't know man that seems like a lot of work I don't really want to do that I've got a girlfriend who I'm probably gonna get married to and he goes all right well no big deal we'll find someone else and so they find someone else and it's a uh these four guys or three guys and they started a YouTube channel and a snap or a Snapchat Channel and then a YouTube channel and it's called yes Theory have you heard of yes Theory oh no way that's that came from that yeah isn't that crazy so yes theory is this it's like three guys and their whole idea is like they do crazy [ __ ] where they like and these guys are like they're they're my age but at the time when they started they were like 25 and 26 so like these young like good looking dudes and they would meet someone on the streets of Venice this like cute girl and be like hey do you want to go to Rome right now or they would get they would get in an Uber and they're like hey Uber driver um do you want to go to Hawaii this second we'll go and just leave your car then we'll just pay for everything and they do these crazy things like this and it's this great show and it started this way as as one of these Snapchat shows and so what these young women are doing with this like with this Media Company it's the same thing that like has worked before in the past yeah that's that's really cool I didn't know uh I didn't know you did that wow you were so close to a whole different life I don't regret it man those guys like have if you follow their story dude they get burnt out like because they would do this crazy stuff at first it was like let's go skydiving or let's make a bucket list and do it and then it was like let's go to the most remote place on Earth for 24 hours and then let's go live on an island with people who have never seen white people why is it that you always hear about YouTubers getting burnt out but you never hear podcasters really getting burnt out because we don't do [ __ ] we just sit here and talk like we don't have to do anything like dude my friend Noah Kagan has this YouTube channel where he has to go and like among many things he like knocks on doors and asks people how they got rich dude I don't even if I don't see Corn Flakes at the grocery store I don't buy it I'm too embarrassed to ask the clerk at the counter where they are like if it's not on Amazon or easily available at a corner store I don't buy it like I can't imagine knocking on a door and asking them how they got rich it's hard it's exhausting especially like Noah's cool he's he's a friend of ours but isn't it kind of like no you're above this like you're Noah you're rich we should be knocking on your door and asking you how you got rich this is the point of being rich that you don't have to do this [ __ ] yeah but he's you know broke boys he's trying to play the game he's trying to get popular I don't know he's just trying to get popular and so it's working and he actually has this new series where he interviews old people and who are rich and asks him if it was worth it and that's actually a very very cool series that one that one's cooler it's also more like a podcast it's yes but yeah dude youtubing is just it seems too hard of a job so anyway yeah I'm about what these young women are doing but uh before you move are you ready to move on to the next one yeah let's go to something else wait but before you do I have to I want to say something to our listeners I'm gonna say this every episode now until we hit like 500 000 subscribers I want to present a a gentleman's agreement do you know what a gentleman's agreement is Sean I was born under a gentleman's agreement I could a gentleman's agreement I don't know what that means actually I actually don't know what it means it's a non-papered contracted agreement so people tell us all the time that they get addicted and they get obsessed with this podcast that is awesome and so it doesn't matter if you're on YouTube if you're on Spotify or you're on iTunes whatever you're using right now if this is our your the first episode you're listening to you get this one for free but if it's the second episode or more that you've listened to here's our Gentleman's Agreement you go to your YouTube app or whatever you're on and you click subscribe or follow or whatever it is and you do that for us we make this for you we're your like little research laboratory rats we're doing all this crap for you just go and do that for us because the more you do that the more views we're gonna get the more hyped we get the more dopamine we get and the harder we work so that's our gentleman's agreement if this is your second plus episode just go and do that for us right now that's that's my gentleman's agreement and and the goal is you said 500 1000 what YouTube subscribers I think we should just say 500 I think we should just say 500 000 YouTube subscribers we've gone from 20 000 to 150 000 in the last year 150 to 500 this year 2023. all right down 500 also where's our plaque I don't know dude I want the platform like where is the plaque oh you know we've been talking about participation trophies like it's a bad thing I want it I want that yeah yeah you say 80 of success is just showing up what I showed up where's my plan yeah we were supposed to get a flag at a hundred thousand you got sent to the HubSpot headquarters somewhere darmesh is sitting there polishing our plaque showing it off at his parties like it's his where is the plaque I need to know there's a conspiracy and I need to know and I told I told the people on Twitter because I said hey who should keep the plaque me Sam how are we gonna do this we're remote it's only one plaque they said they'll give you a bunch of them and then people said small boy stuff you're worrying about a hundred thousand dollar a hundred thousand subscriber plaque and I said you know what you're right we're gonna take the plaque we're gonna take it to a field and we're gonna destroy it because it's totally small boy plaque we're not we're not celebrating until we're at a million um but we need the plaque to destroy it office based style like that is the yeah I have no problem destroying your plaque yeah you frame yours my point is this is our gentleman's agreement and I'm gonna I'm gonna bring up our agreement every single time we do a pod so that's it that's all I gotta say we can go to the next segment I do think you totally misused gentleman agreement but whatever it's uh that's the best okay what um you had a thing about uh coffee Zilla and also can we talk two after things happened after our previous episodes number one Tim Ferriss tweeted out our podcast cool moment Tim first maybe what was one of the first podcasts I ever listened to love that guy he listened to our section where we're talking about him and my experience meeting him and all that your experience meeting him and he said first he emailed me just goes hey heard heard the Pod loved it it was so funny Sam was talking about how OCD I am about editing things he goes normally I am but you edited a great thumbs up don't worry about it and I was like okay good uh and then by the way I hope I was I hope he didn't take that as disrespect it was supposed to be a compliment yeah an admirable thing Tim ignore the words we say we're sucking up to you all right whatever we say we might make some footfalls on that but we just badly want to be your friend all right that's just all that's that's all that you need to take away from any of this um all right second thing we did this episode with Billy McFarland the guy from fire festival and I think you like hit him up and hung out with him afterwards is this true yeah he on the Pod or either like before after I forget I told him where I'm basically visiting family right now and he said oh yeah I'm right down the street from you and so I texted him and I just said thanks for coming on yeah like I'm we're I'm down the street from you and and he said great you want to go hang out right now I go yeah sure let's just go we'll go get some ice cream what'd you guys do we went and got we got tea because it was past 3 P.M and I didn't want to drink coffee by the way so I got that is the move don't do coffees anymore ice cream just take people out to ice cream it's an amazing move they want to lick a thing in front of them I think that's weird right you gotta get the spoon yeah and so we went and hung out and we talked about like I I can't talk about it all but we talked about like his family I just wanted to ask him I was like tell me about how you were raised like tell me about your family so I won't mention that stuff but we talked about family stuff uh and then we talked about like uh prison stories um which she like mentioned on the Pod a little bit and then I basically told him what I said here which was this idea that you had on the pod that's really stupid man I bet you you could charge startups twenty thousand dollars a month and be like a consultant just do that and he goes yeah let's talk about that and so we talked about that about like what we would do if if we were in his situation and what I think he should do and uh I talked about um the mistakes he made and like why did you why what were you thinking and he basically expanded on what we talked about in the Pod which was like I just didn't want to look stupid and I lied and I was embarrassed and I just got into this you know I just did something bad but uh yeah hung out with them and here's my takeaway I understand why people believed him very believable very Charming um like every time he did take you to ice cream after all dude yeah like I got whined and done and I could honestly see myself becoming friends with him but at the same time I'm like are you doing it again uh so you know and that's what I told him I was like it's hard I think he was I think he was entertaining enough and I think he seemed fun like why not be friends with them and hey even if he does it again it's as my [ __ ] up friend man everybody's got a [ __ ] up friend who just keeps [ __ ] up he might be yours it's okay if that's the worst case scenario let's say he's the worst case scenario he kind of you know steps in in poo poo again makes makes the bad decision let's say that's the worst case scenario that's all right no no no sweat I feel like you're a little scared to just be friends with this guy just be friends with him dude our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better I'll be friends with them I won't do any business with them for a long time until like we've you know he's proven to hang out with them in public together Are you ashamed I already did I already did no I hung out with them in public no and if someone if I was if I was with him and someone said something mean to him I would be like dude you gotta don't do that right now please let's say that about my friend Billy yeah don't say about my friend Billy because here's the deal that's what I'm talking about dude he served his time so uh I've like a volunteered I'm a saint by the way I volunteered at prisons before so like I'm a real Saint uh I've like worked with these types of people before everyone gets gets a second chance and man five years or how much did he serve four years that's a long [ __ ] time that is a long time that is college except like you don't leave your dorm room ever you know like it's the worst and uh you know I think he paid the price so I it was really exciting to to kind of hang out with him what did you think about the Pod with them yeah I thought it was good uh I thought he was you know likable and I thought he was interesting and I all the same things you thought I thought he was like about that he's interesting uh you know I thought he's you know owned up to what he did and he didn't try to deny it or deflect it or give some BS excuses he was just like yeah I messed up I did it and I think that most people who lie don't lie because they're evil they lie because they're insecure and they lie because they're afraid I know this because anytime I lie is because I'm insecure or afraid and um and so you know I don't really like I think that's a completely understandable thing and I think he did it at a scale which was bad obviously that affected people that was bad uh but also you know put it into perspective you know like what did he do he lied to professional investors who you know in their diligence didn't uncover it they're fine you know no harm done for them there were some people that went to this uh Festival that got disappointed that's you know unfortunate but you know okay but it was a bad really bad party and then I think the worst thing was like the locals of the island I think were sort of left holding the bag in some way I don't know the full details of that but I would say that's probably the most kind of harm done from it and I don't think that was his intention at all right I think his intention was to try to pull this thing off and he he uh tried to fake it till you make it and he faked it and didn't make it and like this is what happens when you fake it didn't make it right so like I think that he rightfully got convicted I think he served his time and I don't hold that against him uh go forward I was just giving you a hard time because I feel like you like the guy but you're trying to like slightly tiptoe a bit around it and I think you're honestly and he's fine and you know like let's let's move on with life and see what he does from here that is my honest feeling I like him and I'm eager to see what he does but I'm still like I'm still arms like but here's here's what the fascinating thing that I hung out with him I call it like the resistance so I've said this before the world wants us to be vanilla they want us to put put us in his box and people who residated where are you going with this people who resist that I'm fascinated by them even if they are truly a saint or if they're a criminal there is like this Allure this Fascination that I have with them no matter what and I think we all do we all like that you know people who are like this is why cult leaders are awesome you're like oh my God you're convincing me that there's like another way of living and and he has that same thing and there's levels to this is what I'm learning and his level of like he he kept telling me he was like I thought I could pull it off and in my head I'm like you're [ __ ] insane everything every little bit of of evidence points to you not being able to pull this off but there's something about you that you think that you could pull this off even when all the odds are against you and you're delusional you still believe it and there's something incredibly fascinating about this and it's so interesting that that he raised 25 million dollars for a festival when he was 25 years old and he was just like yeah this is what we're gonna do I only look forward he was I think he said on the potty goes I only look forward to like what's gonna happen uh and I like I was like that's fascinating to me because that is not what we are we're we're we're we're bullied into this box and anyone who resists that I think is interesting to me I think you are you've touched on something very very true I used to say this all the time I go I feel like the world is Baskin Robbins but all 31 flavors are vanilla and I was just because I was like I look around and it's all vanilla vanilla over here another vanilla Choice over there another vanilla Choice over there every's living these very vanilla lifestyles and I'm not going to pretend I'm some Renaissance Man adventurous but in my own way I feel like I fight the good fight against vanilla I try to choose to live my life in a way that makes sense to me even if it is non-standard um and that has and that is something like deep inside deep inside the core I feel that I feel that that's what I'm meant to do that's how I'm meant to live and I take great pride anytime I do something non-vanilla I try not to do it just for non-vanilla sake but actually sometimes I do that too just to push it right like sometimes I just go and I go eat the you know caramel ribbons or the the bubble gum flavor whatever I don't even like it the bubblegum flavor tastes tastes nasty but I'll just do it just to remember remind myself not to be totally vanilla and so I am with you on that and that brings me to something that you tweeted out that I wanted to talk about it's called The Adventurous this is a how sick is that you tweeted something out about this you go this did you say I don't know what you say this looks awesome I want to do it I go to the website immediately I'm like oh this requires leaving the house not gonna do it but let's just check out what other people are doing copywriting is so good the copywriting is right I'm just going to read it out loud because I think it is worthy of of a little oral speech here so we're The Adventurous this is what it says on the website we're fighting to make the world less boring our planet used to slap us about the face cheeks with iron fists of Adventure every day Maps had edges to walk off whole continents lay undiscovered but now the entire surface of the Earth has been scanned by satellites and shoveled into your mobile phone tagged with twattery about what restaurant serves the best mocha latte frappa [ __ ] we live to find ways to make the world a bit more difficult to bring chaos into our over sanitized lives to create Adventures where you don't know what will happen tomorrow or even if you'll make it because we think there's no greater moment than those seconds as you leap into an abyss of uncertainty and potential disaster okay so this is our art fellow artists out there you remember the episode where Sam declared that he's an artist has got to create [ __ ] this is this is really amazing copywriting I think this is like such a good example for the swipe file of a I like you know in my power writing course I'm gonna like use this as one of the examples of an US versus them uh us first them frame status quo breaker which says the status quo if they took something good which was that wow your mobile phone has you know like the full map and you can get directions you can find the best restaurants you can and they're like you coddled little baby you are you living this over sanitized life don't you remember what you were put on this Earth to do and how life used to be back in the good old days and I think that that Nostalgia the US versus them this is amazing copywriting are you gonna actually do one of their things yeah I messaged them and I and I said like uh I was like hey I'm gonna try and brag to you because I want to impress you but here's who I am and I like listed off a bunch of credentials I go I'm not asking for a discount also a great copy how do you how do you brag without how do you brag while nodding at like I know what I'm doing here I know why I'm doing this I just want to say this out loud likeable bro yeah I emailed them I go uh well I'm gonna list a bunch of accomplishments because I want you to know who I am I'm not exactly a somebody but I'm not exactly not a somebody uh here's what I've done and I and I listed it out and I go the reason I'm explaining this is I'm gonna pay full price I'm not asking for any type of discount or anything like that but like I want to do one of the America one and I want to baby like bring a bunch of friends and like tweet about it and things like that like when are you doing in America one because they don't basically what this company does is you pay nineteen hundred dollars or something like that it's pretty cheap and then they either give you a car or a motorcycle or maybe a bicycle for different races and they host these races like in Mongolia and they drop you off at Point a and then it's like you have three days to travel 300 miles to point B and they literally just say all right everyone bye we'll meet you at point B figure it out and like one of those things is like you have to drive a mini bike which is like a 50cc that which is a very small motorcycle it's basically what they wrote on Dumb and Dumber another one is uh like a car that is a rickshaw which is like a well you know what direction does yeah yeah and so like they do these crazy things and yeah they're amazing and Sean go to their FAQs for the event this is another like really good um a really good way to like explain how to do copywriting because they're FAQs they're discussing go to like click one of their random races and then go to like the FAQs they're discussing really serious topics in an incredibly conversational way so they'll say like they'll say like um we plan on doing this unless kobit ruins it then it just ruins it like they just like talk in a really here's an example I clicked Mongolia and it says the route uh the section one the route Mongolia is big really effing big and driving through it as any of you ex Mongol rallies know is brain squashingly awesome thousands of miles of endless Horizons mountains dirt roads Nomads blah blah so riding through it on a motorbike designed for children is simply resplendent I don't know what that means uh Mongolia calls to the soul like a flight [ __ ] and then it sort of explains what's going on and then go to like go to FAQs and you'll see like they're like you pay 1900 with that comes your little mini bike some of which are good some are bad but that's part of the excitement and then like like they uh and they just like explained this like what will I eat mutton noodles question mark whatever you bring with you buy on the route or are lucky to be offered lucky enough to be offered along the way period next question yes how good is that foreign yeah this is really cool who's behind this is this like uh just a guy I think it's just two guys like two friends like these like I I watch their videos they make launch videos for each one and just two guys uh it's really fascinating so I want to do one I don't want to travel to Mongolia because like by the time they have it maybe I'll have like a kid or something I don't know but like I would like to like like if they were like if I could go to Colorado or Canada or like Mexico I would do it we're more like a convenient adventurist yeah yeah so like all the wild in my backyard yeah so if they could do that uh speaking of like levels and like content have you seen coffee Zilla I've seen coffee Zilla yes can we talk about this yeah let's talk about it let me give you the background about this guy so his name's coffee Zilla he only has one point something million subscribers on YouTube so he's not huge huge yet but he's growing quickly and yeah small boy stuff he um and he uh basically his whole thing is he wants to uncover internet scams um not just internet but mostly internet so guys like um uh fellow podcast guests uh Tai Lopez like he'll do a whole thing with Ty Lopez or he'll do a whole thing on Andrew Tate or whole thing on Dan Lok who's like another internet guy which are like typical question that I often Google which is is X person legit exactly and he's trying to answer that question and usually he's going in saying they're not legit here's here's what we know so he's playing this with you know a bunch of people and now he's doing on Logan Paul Logan Paul had a thing called the crypto zoo I think it was called which was like this crypto project that had all this [ __ ] going on but the point being he has the most attention to detail [ __ ] I've ever seen like I I saw this on Casey neistat Casey neistat I'm like how are you making just your commute to work so fascinating it was like because he had all these interesting shots that were so thoughtful this guy has the same thing where there'll be like a robot sitting behind a bar and it's just like you know like oh I had a tough day at work coffee still is talking to like a fake robot and I'm like how is this interaction so freaking good or he'll like fly in people who worked with Logan Paul and he'll interview them in person and make this whole like 30 minute video that's as good as 60 minutes and it's so fascinating and it just shows you that there's levels to like the game and people who turn it up a notch I think they're rewarded yeah this guy uh his production quality has gotten like kind of insane um recently and I think that you know he's thriving on some of the big you know questions or controversies SBF uh Logan Paul who else does he do um Jake Paul I think he did uh what's his name uh entertain things and things like that uh yeah he's he's cool he's he's good and I I really like this Niche like I think he's carved out like a really strong Niche um and brand like visual brand too so I think he's done a kind of an amazing job with with his videos and his content but he kind of has pigeon told himself and there's this one move that a lot of people make the liver King made it when he said I do not take steroids and now this guy is he does the same thing where he says I do not make money through advertising through ads because I want you the reader or the viewer to be supporting me so I can make more genuine [ __ ] and I'm like no don't shut that off you may feel that way you may feel that way today but like Casey neistat has this funny thing where he was like dude I had 100 million views before I turned ads on my YouTube because I thought I was being like an artist and that was the stupidest thing ever because like I had I was so broke at the time and I couldn't like make more videos and had I done that I would have made an additional million dollars or whatever it is and that's how exactly how I feel I'd like to just take the money you could take the money and still be cool and ethical and by the way we could put like a before and after on the screen like if you go back into his channel three years ago it's literally him in a messy bedroom he's like holding a mic up with his hand and you know he literally looks different his background looks different and that's like you know how he started and this you can see the jump up and quality in three years is like pretty insane to be honest with you three years isn't that long dude it this podcast is three years old I think and like just like the other day you like didn't even wear a shirt when you recorded like like a potential Choice like we we still don't I don't even have a camera that works yet I mean like like this guy this guy basketball hoop behind me now so we're moving up like it took forever just to get a video camera that works and we still call it a video camera uh like yeah I asked how to get a camcorder uh yeah his per his progress is is wonderful yeah that's amazing um all right what else we got what other what other uh content you want to do I don't have anything okay wow the well the well-runath drive uh okay let me give you one um have you seen this website gently.com no I think this is kind of a cool idea basically it's you know like people you do this probably you probably buy like kind of vintage leather goods or whatever off of like I don't know whatever some like eBay or Poshmark or depop there's all these second hand marketplaces that that exist so I just named three or four of them uh the real real right there's like all these different places you could go what gently did was pretty smart was they just said all right how do we make a search engine so you just tell us what product you want we will go search all the different places and then we will just send you text message alerts as we find good deals on that thing here and that brand or that item that you want I think this is pretty smart and then they cut a deal with all the different Marketplace which is hey if we send you the customer we bought we get to bring the customer the buyer to you how do we get you know our 10 kit cut or whatever it is off of that purchase I think this is anytime you have like a fragmented set of places where something is the One-Stop search for it and search and look they did smart there's like these alerts so uh as soon as you put in that you're interested in something they'll just constantly alert you about this thing it's sort of like this like highly targeted you know ad that they're sending you each time and then you can go and you can buy the thing and I think this is pretty cool saves the customer a bunch of time brings these marketplaces customers and um and does it in a way that's like actually like pretty seamless I thought this is actually a pretty cool idea I'm gonna sign up for this uh you are right you stereotype to me correctly you made some pulled you you made a stereotype and uh you're 100 correct uh I was looking at investing in it and I was like all right let me just try using this thing and I was like oh I don't have like Hobbies or tastes like you know there's not a I don't know any of these Brands I don't buy any vintage Goods or like you know exclusive designer things and so didn't really know what to do well it looks like it's you're trying it looks like if it's good well it looks like it's for women mostly um because it's Poshmark that's mostly women I think only women or mostly women the real real Mostly women I actually just went to the real real yesterday they have a story where I'm staying uh it's mostly women I I believe but no I I like this I don't know if this could be a big business wouldn't the margins be like nothing yeah because you're taking a cut of a cut so I think that's the the hard part you have to have like really high volume um but I do think there's an it's a it's enough of an interesting wedge where like they'll probably need a second Miracle meaning if they'd have to the first miracle is getting this popular where people start using this all the time and then the second Miracle is going to be something like you know they they create their own you know Supply on the on the marketplace or they create their own Marketplace out of this or they got to do something maybe it's a subscription I don't know they'd have to come up with some other thing that's going to um gonna make this work so so I do think that that's the that's the second thing all right let me give you an idea now um you've used click funnels correct yeah I have I've made a lot of money using click funnels if I ask you what is Click funnels great at why would anybody use click funnels quickly spin Up drag and drop landing pages that can also accept money and the landing page well there's a bunch of landing page builders that are drag and drop why click funnels is it better design is it you know faster easier to use what is the benefit it's mostly horribly designed uh it looks like it was designed with like a set of crayons and the reason it's like a perfect way to say it yeah it looks like someone like just got like a red and blue crayon and like whiteboard it they just like turn that into a website uh so no uh it does it just has a three or four features that are exactly what you need for getting money quickly on a website and I think you know one of them the way I would describe it is called click funnels for a reason which is that they are they're specifically funnels so they're like designed to convert a customer um through a funnel which the funnel might happen it might be like first we're going to grab their email we're gonna optimize for grab email then once they grab the email we're gonna then offer them this upsell and we're gonna then ask them to pay and if they don't pay then then they'll go here the whole point of their software is to get your money to become my money and that's like what they do they go you have someone on your website how do you get the money in their Bank their bank account into yours and they make it easy so you think I'm like perfect you can exam you accept an email you get the sale you do it upside out you do all this stuff and they're unabashed they they're unashamed whereas upsell it'll be like upsell one then if they say yes hit them with upsell two if they say yes hit them with upsell three if they say no hit them with down sell down sell one down cell two down it's like what the hell are they I literally don't even have enough products to like fill your funnel I don't have down sell products what are these um but it works it works it was quite it works and I think clickfunnels does over 100 million in revenue or something like that they throw that 100 million number around a lot I think it's way more than a time or an annual thing I think they're churn is really high that's that's the problem with these things is like the churn like that attitude of like make your bank account my bank account that all doesn't exactly have the most like the best longevity but yeah your customers are kind of piece of [ __ ] marketers you're like bullying them yeah I think so I think somebody can make a click funnels 2.0 um in fact I think we could make click funnels 2.0 uh like I think if we used our brand we could create a better click funnels which is what the guy did Russell Brunson he had a uh he was like a Content guy I mean he he like had masterminds and [ __ ] like that but he had like a huge email list and then he like launched the software and it wasn't great at first in fact it's still not really that great if there are any developers or designers that don't use crayons um you know build us a click funnels competitor We Will We Will promote it because Cleveland is honestly a very useful tool it is super useful good at doing the job which is the your money to my money thing which is exactly what a lot of people want and it's simple and that's the beauty of it when you make a click funnels page it's like there's no navigation there's no footer there's no scroll it's like yeah it's a giant box that says give me your [ __ ] email and it says it's like a flashing button and it says if you click this thing with your email something good is gonna happen and like they'll might be something good I guess I'll put my email in and for some reason I don't know why this is still a thing when you sell a product there all of the product images are like pictures of DVD and PC game boxes do you know what I mean it's a box set always it's like a CD dude like I don't even own a thing that could accept a CD why is like this this like product always like a set of CDs yeah looks like this because it's infomercial right it's the equivalent of an infomercial but online um so I think some somebody click funnels I also think specifically for e-commerce there's not really a click funnels for e-commerce there's a bunch of people who think they're you click funnels for e-commerce and trust me I am in e-commerce I have tried to build funnels using Shogun Builder all of these guys nobody's done it nobody has made it simple nobody has made it stupidly obvious where you hit the customer over the head with the offer and like that's all you really need to do and I've looked at so many of these and nobody has nobody's made it dumb enough everybody makes it too smart and um and so I think there's there's generally like a click funnels like 2.0 and I think that there's click funnels for e-commerce is a is an opportunity that's out there and I think you would need like you'd either need to be a Russell Brunson type of guy where you are going to independently build your brand as a smart content entrepreneur marketer type dude or you should partner with uh or like you know we like someone like us who already has that audience and that brand can distribute a product like this and get it to I don't know probably somewhere between like three and six million AR just off of our audience um it's hard it's actually good but the product actually has to be good have you heard of uh well so another thing that click funnels did like these guys are really fascinating and at first I was a hater on them and then I was like oh no they're all right uh but they they they're what their conferences are are a little cringe but still cool like I respect it but they make money off info products and this was so fascinating and so smart so a lot of big software companies they're like dude I'm not gonna sell anything but the software because like this one thing makes so much profit and revenue like I'm just doing this one thing and they were like nah F that see we don't have a lot of money to spend so we're bootstrapped our marketing is going to be profitable and so they write like guides and do all this stuff and they'll charge like a hundred dollars for like a book and when you buy that book you're automatically like get a you know a month free of Click funnels and they basically when they hit 100 million in Revenue it was 80 million in subscription revenue and 20 million in info product revenue and they would create these info products and sell it and that's good because they would acquire a customer for a break-even amount for an info product and automatically add them into their subscription revenue for their software and that was really fascinating I thought it was a great idea and they've proven that it can work really nicely yeah I think in general uh Break Even marketing is a phrase I've used in every every single company I've built which is like what is a version of our marketing that itself is a not a cost center as a profit Center it doesn't have to be the main marketing channel but like we should do something like for you hustlecon was a good example of this right it's like yeah I'm gonna do hustlecon it's going to get people to find out about the hustle it's going to take people who like us and make them love us and make them super evangelists and it's going to get all these speakers to come speak that'll become content so that's marketing there but you were like yeah but this is not just like a money pit no we need to make money on our marketing and I just feel like most people don't really consider that but it like at twitchcon when I was at twitch it's the same thing twitch there's this thing called twitchcon it's this like I don't know 30 40 50 000 people something show up to this thing it's all did they make money off that and they they don't really try to make money off of it but the merch store at twitchcon literally the line is like it's like imagine like the San Diego Conference Center or whatever which is like a you know a three mile long building or some [ __ ] like that the line is the entire three miles it's like the craziest line you've ever seen people waiting slowly like hours to go in to buy your hoodie and I was like this is crazy how much are we making off this and like it was like you know run by this like two-person team it wasn't really like the main focus and like you know the event itself you know has sponsor stuff and they did have Revenue but like I felt like there could be so much more that was done there was so much more like potential to commercialize that thing and I get it which is like in your company of twitch's size you don't need to worry about making a couple million bucks off this thing but if you shrink that it kills me it still kills me yeah exactly exactly it's like well first of all you should have just been able to sell more merch just like by being more efficient like you know how many people didn't wait in this four hour line uh you know that that's just like one thing all together the second thing is um if you're not twitch you're not generating you know call it billion dollars of Revenue uh if you're click funnels or the hustle or you're a normal size business these these break-even marketing things a marketing event that makes you 500k or 1.5 million or something like that that's actually quite meaningful um compared to it losing 500k or losing a million dollars which is where most companies default to and I think just with a little bit of creativity you could turn a lot of cost centers into profit centers or at least Break Even when it comes to marketing dude there's this attitude that I've been having lately so I've been working on this like new project and I've switched my attitude when I was starting the hustle I was like um I'll do anything for any Advertiser to make any amount of money like whatever dude you know what I mean like I'm like whatever I just need I need pennies give me pennies I'll do it all and I'm like yeah sure like you know you know the rules said no CBD but like you know like what's I have an eraser we can erase that rule and uh now I've been like saying like nope this is what it is I say no to everything and like oh this person wants to join I don't really feel like it let's just raise the price really high so they don't want to join or like you know what I mean or like like let's like this this type of attitude it's made it's made the businesses so much more successful having that attitude and like it's it's pretty funny you know like there's this hot girl that I knew and I was like and she was like joking and she was like my motto for getting dudes is uh treat them mean keep them Keen the meaner I treat them the happier the more they want me and I was like that's the greatest thing ever I'm gonna do that with my life of course it didn't work with women but uh it's kind of worked with business this tree to mean keep them Keen it's like the more we say no the more they want it and I can't believe it's worked that way dude rhyming is just an underrated strategy in general let me just put that out there I don't know what the hell she's talking about but it rhymed and that made me feel good made me think that she's got her [ __ ] together dude treat them mean keep them Keen you lived in Australia Akin means like you know like you like them yeah you shouldn't need a dictionary for your catchphrases I I that's my personal opinion um right like you didn't know who Dolly Parton was though so like you don't really know anything [Laughter] all right um I got a bone to pick with the fitness industry so you're fit I'm aspiring to be fit yeah and a lot of the products I feel are geared towards people like you it's like bro you want to be ripped it's hey do you want you know girls do you want a bigger butt and flatter stomach you know that's kind of like me that's you and then that's the female version of you um I feel like 90 of like ad dollars go towards that when it comes to Fitness would you say that's true yeah just people who want to look good naked so you're struggling with your light bulb there by the way I know see there's this thing there's this compass that lets you show how to center it perfectly so that it uh floats but it's not not participating people are loving that thing by the way you're gonna sell a lot of them in the videos they're loving that light bulb yeah I know I'm not shouting out who made this because I'm gonna make our own this is this is the start of our merch store I've decided we need to do merch um we're two we're too [ __ ] catchy to not have merch bro we just gotta get the coin business um coins dollar bills whatever all right so so anyways Fitness okay 90 of dollars I feel like go towards getting you spring break ready but uh my trainer for example he works out he works me out in the garage and in doing so there's a whole bunch of people that pass by and I gotta say the most interested group of people that pass by are not looking to get ripped shredded jacked swole whatever words you want to say those aren't the words that they're interested in they want to be knee pain-free they want to be back pain free they want to be foot pain free and I feel like the pain-free uh version of exercise is a little under marketed and for every you know P90X or Beachbody program I think that there should be a even bigger version of that that's just helping Mom not have knee pain when she walks or gets up from her chair and um and I think that what happens is there's a lot of workout programs that would say we could do that that's what ours our program is great for that like we both like these over toes guy he's great for that but there's still this leap that the person has to put together that oh if I do these exercises then that will be the the benefit that I get out of it whereas somebody else might be trying to jump higher run faster and I think that in the same way that the uh you know that vitamin brand Ollie how they instead of saying we provide vitamin D uh or we we provide magnesium it's like it's like we better sleep better yeah yeah immunity sleep better you know whatever they basically just go straight to the benefit and I think that there should be a juggernaut of a fitness company that is simply trying to make it so that you are back pain and knee pain and foot pain free neck pain these are common pains that people who are you know know have a ton of money have a ton of motivation to get these things fixed and it's just a lightweight exercise program I've been telling you about this remember I was like my Instagram feed is just full of shirtless dudes like stretching their hips and like doing like stretches like it's just this whole they call it Mobility now Mobility is the new pain-free you know or Mobility is like the new yogabilities I think I think it's the right idea but I think it's the wrong frame I don't need shirtless dudes stretching their hips I need Mom saying um I woke up every day and I had this problem I just I just thought it was I'm getting old that's it and then they put me on this you know 21 Day program by Dr knee and Dr knee thank you so much I now walk pain-free I walk my dog I can play with my grandkids thank you so much Dr knees and we need Dr knees as the brand and we need the testimonial not being ripped shirtless guy stretching his hips it needs to be you know what do they call it the silver tsunami or whatever like it used to be somebody with a little gray hair saying how they used to not be able to just you know do simple stuff in the kitchen and get out getting out of bed and now they can I I mean I don't know what else to say other than yeah I agree uh the company um was it called uh what was the thing that it's like I I have one is it hypervolt I forget one of the one of those like either hypervolt or therageous they said I remember the scene their pitch when they raised money they go we want to be the Nike for recovery and right I actually don't I think is the thing is it hyper ice I think that'd be challenging to pull off because they're just kind of selling like a product that's a bit commoditized now just like this vibrating thing uh but they've done a pretty good job with The Branding but I think that that pitch was quite interesting and I actually think it has legs I think challenging but it has legs and I think you could also have like a Nike for you know like pain-free like like I actually do think that that's like there is something quite interesting there with that yeah the way calm did around meditation if someone did around just getting rid of pains that you think you have to live with but actually can be reversed do you have pain I don't but like like for example my trainer he trains he trains me but he also trains my mom he trains my neighbor who's like the CEO of a big tech company but then he also trains his mom and in fact my neighbor who's the CEO of a tech company he will miss sessions all the time because like you know whatever he's on calls and [ __ ] like that but his mom never misses it and she's never worked out like she didn't have a gym membership so she went from 900 gym membership to having a personal trainer and would you see what he'd has her do it's like is this a library like you're stationary for like 90 of the workout and it's like yeah if she's sitting down flat footage she's just trying to push up from like you know her toes because her toes are incredibly weak and that's causing a whole bunch of structural issues so he just works toes then ankles then he gets to the to the calf and the hamstring then the knee you know and he's just working his way up rebuilding it and she's like mowing her lawn now like she couldn't like walk basically like she could from my neighbor's house to my house she basically couldn't get there each day and now she's literally mowing her lawn and um and that's like kind of a kind of kind of a crazy recovery why don't you just get ripped just do that also I'm trying your boy likes cheese okay there's a little bit of a problem so I I'm gonna have to show you a shirtless pick because oh so I like it got really strong and then over the past like eight weeks I've lost 15 pounds and I'm trying to like I just like to try to do things so now I'm trying to get skinny and everyone's like how are you doing it and the answer is I just don't really eat you just be hungry all the time and my trainer my trainer was like well what's your goal and he I go uh I want to look good naked and live forever and uh he was like cool well one of the proven things that makes that people live for a long for a long time is calorie restriction so just not eating a lot so if you want to live for a long time you just got to get used to not eating a lot so I'd be getting used to it and it's not so bad it's not so bad but it is kind of bad it's pretty bad I'm on that Warren Buffett kick bro I try to live till 95 Rich happy

there was a letter in 1972 that Warren Buffett wrote to the CEO of C's candy after they had bought Sea's candies he's like Coors gets a lot of mileage out of the fact that all their beer comes from One Brewery and I do think that a certain Mystique attached to products from with a geographical uniqueness maybe grapes from a little part of Italy or France are really the best in the world but I've always had a suspicion that 99 of it is just in the telling about it and one percent isn't the drinking he's talking about like sort of this marketing psychology giving them like ideas for catchphrases and slogans this is way more active and sort of like the brain switched on in terms of operating that I had thought

most internet entrepreneurs when they get into starting businesses they do things that are either black hat or gray hat and then they realize I gotta do things legit because I don't want to go to jail and I can make more money doing things ethically and not breaking the law like you just like make so much more money being legit how on Earth did you not learn that lesson earlier [Music] all right today's pod is interesting we just had Billy McFarlane and he's famous for the fire festival thing which basically was this like huge Coachella type event that went viral four years ago and he ended up committing a ton of crimes that he admitted to and was a charged and convicted of like 25 or 30 million dollars worth of fraud we just had him on the Pod very confusing pod Sean I think not confusing but but like mixed emotions yeah yeah I mean he's an interesting guy he's also uh complicated like most people and uh you know I don't know I think we I think it was pretty interesting we talked about a bunch of things we talked about kind of his origin story how he got to the fire festival and almost like where it all went wrong so where did he start making you know mistakes and then eventually committing crimes uh we talked about life in prison and what that was like in solitary confinement and things like that we talked about what he's doing now how he's trying to come back and me and Sam are a little bit hard on his new idea I would say well to the point of if this was a normal if this was just a normal person random person on the street I would not have been as harsh but I felt like I I don't know for whatever reason I felt like I had the license to be a little harsh on this one um we talked about that yeah we talked about other ideas about what he could do or other opportun business opportunities he sees uh pretty fascinating guy very fascinating guy the thing that like that sits bad with me is or it makes me confuses he's very likable he's a very likable person incredibly Charming very charismatic and I want him to win but he did a lot of really bad [ __ ] and he seems a little a little coached in the sense that he's like right up front we'll say uh what I did was terrible I deserve no sympathy uh you know I was wrong and I was an idiot right and he's very quick to kind of own that which is great you'd want somebody to own it but it's also I think that's somebody who who understands okay this is the message I gotta stay on this message and um yeah I gotta make it really clear where I stand on that it's like when you have like a star football player a star athlete in high school and you see them like doing bad [ __ ] off the field and you're like dude you have it all man you've got the talent please don't blow this it it hurts us all to see someone with so many gifts do such bad [ __ ] and that's a little bit how I felt with this and uh yeah I'm I say this in the end but I'm eager to see how this story ends I'm gonna be following it and I think it was a good pod uh Ben our producer Ben thought uh it went great he was messaging US during it but I uh I think people will like it yep all right enjoy all right let's just get right into this so it sounds like you have like staff like you just asked someone to get you a coffee so are you like are you back I mean you're you're you're in the mix again you're working yeah broke as hell but uh taking advantage of you know anybody I can get to help me try to rebuild and start making things right and do you have like a crazy restitution thing so we should explain kind of what the so this is Billy Billy created fire Festival most notably you may have seen I don't know the documentaries or whatever you just got out of prison but one of the things that's associated with it is you have like more than 20 million or something that you have to pay back in restitution to some combination of investors uh creditors people like that how does that work you do you have to give them like every dollar or is it a certain percentage like how does that work because that's a deep deep hole yeah and it's brutal I'm like I just can't think about that big number because then you know I'll sort of lose track about like what's happening today and tomorrow so how it works is that I have to pay a percentage of all of my personal income you know directly back to restitution like after taxes they calculated on just like gross income so totally pre-tax income so make like a thousand dollars this week I have a set percentage I have to pay on that thousand dollars but what is in addition to that yeah what's the percent is it like crazy or is it like five percent it's more than five I'm not sure like where it's gonna end up it varies based on income so I know what I have to pay right now but I think it gets readjusted every couple of months and then in addition to that pirates giving 10 of all of its Revenue back to restitution as well so if pirate gets 100K sponsorship deal like it'll pay 10K right away and then whatever I get as my like salary or income I'll pay an additional percentage on top of that so I'm just trying to pay more than I have to why are you doing this right now why are you I mean like you know you're in a different situation I I firmly believe that I I listen to your pot the pods that you've done I've watched the documentary I've read a little bit like you made a massive mistake so yeah I think that you you you deserved to be punished and so I don't feel sorry for that for I don't feel sorry for you for having to do that I think five years or four years however much you serve that's that's a lot so my my current stance is like everyone deserves a second chance and if you if you do the crime and you have to do the time like you you there should be a point where it's like all right you screwed up you get it you can try again I feel that but when I see you doing this podcast push right now I'm like should we is he taking advantage of us like why is this guy doing this right now why is he what what is he gonna was he trying to sell or or is this therapeutic or are you just trying to make a living which well you know what what's your what's your motivation between this recent push yeah so like first of all totally deserved what I got and sorry I think there's like days where I felt like I got too much time there's days where I felt like I didn't get enough just like based on everything else happening in the world so deserved it was coming and like definitely not looking for sympathy I think there's two things here one is that by doing these podcasts I'm getting great like inbound deal flow so if three or four companies are listening to this and they're like oh wait he actually does know how to Market he can get us attention and they'll come and hire me like that's amazing that's my entire purpose of like doing this small media run right now I think it's like looking at your Twitter comments a little bit this morning before I came on the show a lot of people and other hosts have gotten the same feedback is like why the hell would you give a con artist like any time of day um love your loved your response but I think the response to all those people is like what did I say you said like maybe an interesting conversation that will get us money transparency I said I said uh an interesting person or a cure an interesting person that would have an interesting conversation and it will get us a lot of views uh I think that's cool like other people haven't been able to say that so I think that's great but I think to them is that anybody who has taken life to the extreme or too far has learned like a lot of good and bad lessons from that so like they can use me right and if there's like one entrepreneur here who's trying to raise money and he or she thinks like [ __ ] this is a little harder than I thought 60 days ago and they're about to send out that monthly investor update don't [ __ ] up your numbers like Don't Go Over the Top to to raise that cash and like if I can stop one person really cool but on the other end of the spectrum if there's somebody who's going about it honestly and they're scared to kind of take that leap like if I could Inspire them to go and try to make their brand pop off really cool as well so I think there's lessons to be learned and people could kind of use all of my mistakes to help them wherever they are in their entrepreneurial journey and you you are kind of a hustler so you um uh we'll kind of Go Fast through it but you basically when you're in middle school started creating projects I don't even want to say company because like you know I don't know how much of a company it is when you're in middle school but like you were building products and uh launching them as websites that's right is that right like in Middle School yeah just basically started doing super basic HTML CSS in like fifth and sixth grade and so this is what 20 21 22 years ago and it was pretty much like the Wild Wild West days of the internet and started a couple of like web hosting companies and basic social networks and that was really my foray into the world of Entrepreneurship and technology so you you make those sites you end up selling them or you sold at least one of them uh for like what like uh a big way and a small win what would you do when you were kind of like you're probably 2006 and seventh grade yeah yeah these are a couple thousands of dollars so life-changing to you know okay just wants to buy candy but and at this point kind of irrelevant but I think like kind of got me into the game um started a little bit of a bigger media site called 24 scene in high school and sold that 2014 yes sell it to a company called buddy TV out of Seattle when I was 16. what did that do what was 24c it was a Content Network and I love the TV show 20 for so was basically clipping you know Snippets of the 24 show and this is before streaming so it's hard 24. yeah exactly so it's hard to get like actual media of the shows this is all based on like you know Fox like aired it and then it really was very little media afterwards so I was taking like the show that aired and clipping it up and ended up doing it for a half a dozen TV shows and I had this business partner at the time who was in his mid-30s in Michigan but I never met and he like orchestrated the sale and then he paid me out on Western Union every two weeks for like the remainder of my high school so that was pretty crazy how much did you how much you make doing that it was like tens of thousands of dollars like but at the time it was it was wild for me and from there is you you went to school and you you graduated but you never had a real job did you went to college um basically started living off of my 2014 Capital under this little suitcase under my bed for my freshman year of college and for the first time I started going out like going to nightclubs going to dinners like exploring what every 18 year old I think man like wants to see what's out there in the world and flew all my cash in a couple of months so I'm like [ __ ] now I'm broke sitting in my college in this like small town I can't afford to like try to find a car to take me to New York City anymore like what can I do so got back to what I knew which was basic programming and started a social networking website called spling during my freshman year of college and that introduced me this entire world of like venture capital and Angel Investing and essentially dropped out of school halfway-ish through my freshman year to work on spling and then I started this whole like run of venture capital backed startups my um my wife uh through friends of friends somehow uh had some run-ins with you at Penn like like apparently like good running or you know someone you must have dated someone who were friends of someone and she and she uh they would tell me stories about uh they're like yeah we knew him and he would always rent like these fat cars and drive us all and pay for everything to go to New York City from Philly uh and like he we just thought like he just had some business and no one knew what it was no it wasn't anything inappropriate but it was just like he just like just we all do it's this guy who must have had some money through some internet companies and he uh he treated on all of us on a regular basis yes I went to went to Philly for a company called dream Adventures which is kind of like this accelerator incubator program and it was dating a girl at the time who was I think it's a sophomore now at Penn so I should have been a sophomore in school so all my like peers and friends were in college and like so I'd be like at dream it trying to raise money by day and then like at the terrible like college parties by night and then obviously trying to take them to New York so what what triggered this switch from like uh I'm a kid programmer who likes to make hobbyist websites like you know scenes from my favorite TV show 24 to like I'm trying to be the man because it seems like at some point you all your business ventures switched to like things that were super cool right you did the Black Card credit card thing uh you did fire obviously which was like you know the next Coachella so at some point you switched from like kind of hobbyist websites to how do I be the cool guy you know the Big Man on Campus type of thing what what triggered that that switch for you yeah I think that's a good question and it was almost like I was living these alternative lifes and not really fitting in with either one I was a college kid but trying to raise money from Venture capitalists when you know at my little school the majority of the students haven't heard of the word like venture capital in their life and then so I'd go hang out with these Venture capitalists who were Titans of industry or you know successful Angel Investors and kind of go back to the college realm so I was always kind of interested in merging the Two Worlds so when I'm hanging out with the VCS the college kids all want access to this and they would hire me to help like Market or consult so it was kind of hustling and trying to make side income to to fund a lifestyle and trying to kind of keep up with this new world that my basic programming had been giving me access to and then at what point so the was like your first kind of it wasn't a real win like you didn't exit but you raised I think four or six million dollars was that the the magnet is it called magnesis yes so um turn 19 graduated from the dream Adventures moved spling to the second ever we work labs uh down on Barrack Street in New York and I was there we were now around he's like 30-ish you know hustling entrepreneurs all trying to make it I'm a kid and went out to dinner with just like a group of these friends I was starting to meet in New York who are a little bit older a little bit more established and one of them pulls out this black American Express Centurion card and kind of slams it on the table to show off and I'm like [ __ ] I have 40 in my Chase account like how how can I do this so I went back to my wework office went online to Alibaba before Alibaba was really like a mainstream thing uh particularly like in New York in the US bought these black metal cards and bought a Credit Card Copier they kind of came in the mail took my Chase blue debit card copied it onto this black card went to the pizza place across the street from the wework guy was treating me like I was royalty went back into the office and just saw these cards to all the entrepreneurs in the wework office and then magnesis was born and how big did that business get before it uh before it went South so my nieces did Total like 11 12-ish million in Revenue over three years and my biggest mistake was getting distracted by fire in the fire festival and I understand this is forwarding like years in advance but in the run-up to fire festival for the four or five months I just started trying to get money from anywhere and everywhere and basically milked the magnus's customer base as much as I could and then when fire crashed Magnus went down with it so I'm just not seeing it through was such a [ __ ] up but magnesis was just it was just literally like it's not a bank account it was just literally the physical card as well as some perks like you would get like discounts to certain concerts I guess is where fire kind of got inspiration from yes discounts to certain clubs I guess or like a discount for like a private jet service so you just must have negotiated the deals or probably even white labels like some other company that had found cool deals and knew for 300 you got the sick uh card like literally physically just a card with your same bank account you had access to like a townhouse I forget what you called it a townhouse uh and you got to go to some parties and you got some perks is that basically the model exactly then what was really interesting though was the members were bringing all the perks and benefits so initially I sold these cards and so now let's say we sold a couple hundred cards I'm like wow Our member base is super interesting whether they're entrepreneurs they're people all these different industries that my friends don't really have access to like let's get a space where they can all come and connect so I went and rented a series of Lofts and townhouse that I couldn't afford where basically members can come and hang out anytime and then as magnesis grew we just built an app where members would come to us saying hey I work at this brand whether it's like this plane company this Fitness Studio this fashion brand let's do something special for the rest of the members and they would basically pay us to advertise and give access to cool [ __ ] to the members and the members of pay us an annual fee to get access to these perks it was kind of interesting we're making money from both sides and then relying on the actual member base to create the offering was it profitable so I was just so bad with financial management that we raised you know a few million bucks for magnesis but we never had more than two months of runway in the entire history of the company so I'd raised around and like 80 of that round was already spent in terms of like Bill's owed to employees contractors agencies whatever so it's like always a kiss to death like okay raise a million bucks but [ __ ] I owe 800 Grand and now we have two months to run my left I think my biggest inability was to communicate like that problem to investors I just kept saying like things are great you know you'll raise a million bucks and we're off for the races I couldn't just like really explain how much we needed and why we needed it and that caused us to have to basically become profitable super early on so just started monetizing the user base way more than I should have which I think diminished the value of the brand and for like the last year and a half two years of magnesium it's like we weren't profitable but we were paying all of our bills just based on Revenue we just like tried to monetize too quickly and too fast to keep up with my like crazy expenses but even magnesius magnesis had issues like there's like stories of like you know the the members saying we thought we were buying tickets to blank but turns out like we didn't actually have them or maybe like Hamilton tickets I think there's a story around that like you even had issues then what what uh uh what what were the what were those issues so when fire Festival came and I started going down this terrible Rabbit Hole I needed money from everywhere and anywhere and that included overselling and trying to over promise things to magnesis members to get that capital and it just like took everything down and like I was wrong and I was like lying everywhere thinking I could make these miracles happen and sometimes we did but more often than not we we crashed and burned at the end so it just like totally just like lost track of all the good that was happening and I know you you feel bad and you probably feel you know some shame and all these negative things do you ever just laugh at like wow what the hell like what did I do where did this go how great how far did this thing go it's like there's a reason there's documentaries about it it's literally like a movie is there any part of you that just sort of looks at this and says I can't believe how far I let this thing go and how far it went totally and like I was like looking and trying to think through the SPF scenario you know for the past couple of weeks and I think at the end of the day like he's obviously in a completely different Stratosphere but it's really in his position it's really hard to say no to someone with 10 billion dollars right I don't care like how smart or how wealthy you are so much of our decision-making process is based on social proof and when you meet someone with that kind of capital it immediately checks off all these like subconscious boxes that create this phenomenon on social proof and I think that like to a much larger scale that's what happened to him but it also happened to me where I had thousands of customers or thousands of members and all these talent and artists who are promoting the brand and I was in a position where I was just like way too young way too immature and people who should have helped me were almost scared to say no and I kind of like relished and thrived off of that and this led me down this terrible terrible rabbit hole and when they started saying no I was too like in my own head where oh you know I pulled pulled this off and proved you wrong before I just like didn't know how to press that red button to stop and that was like one of my biggest issues I think the reason you're interesting because every entrepreneur we have a lot of I mean people who like listen to this Potter like entrepreneurial and everyone like most internet entrepreneurs when they get into starting businesses they do things that are either black hat or gray hat and then they realize they realize like okay this is sick I know how to make money like I'm proficient at this skill set but like I gotta do things legit because I'm gonna make way more money if I and I do the same thing I used to do these like I mean I've done criminal [ __ ] as well and I'm like what the hell am I thinking I should do things the right way because I don't want to go to jail and I can make more money doing things ethically and not breaking the law like you just like make so much more money being legit how on Earth did you not learn that lesson earlier I think just craziest thing is I didn't know really what failure was until I failed on such a massive scale um I think part of what let me go so far is I obviously had as many losses if not more than every other entrepreneur along the journey but I was really good or I guess really bad at blocking out that noise and I was so focused on like this end goal of Nothing Else Matters like let me put my blinders on just like keep running forward and I just kept getting jaded to failures until the failure became so big that I'm I'm locked in solitary confinement and what was the end goal like for for me it's like I want to make a certain amount of money so I could have a certain house so I don't have to worry anymore so I could spend my monthly however much I want and then there's there's I me and I mean all of us have some ego thing of like I want to prove to people that I'm Legit yeah um what what was your but I like had a certain money goal in mind I imagine Sean's the same way he's like well I want this lifestyle I want this what what what's your motivating factor in all this like and you say I want to have a 100 million dollars a net worth by a certain age or I want girls to have sex with me which is like we all obviously do like what's like the motivating factor I want to fit in I think I I had two big like insecurities and drives one is those initial investors who backed me when I was 18. I wanted to prove to them that they were right and fire was seven years later from that 70 years later after that so one I want to prove they were right I was too insecure to show any kinks to my armor to them and two is I wanted to be the guy that just like took you to wild crazy experiences and I'm like wow like this whole programming thing is taking me into this world of entertainment I'm hanging out with Like Rappers and models and Comedians and my friends don't believe me like I want to be that guy who can take you from your shitty college or from your like shitty desk job to this private island where the who's who of the world is flooding in their guards and having a blast so it was partly like proving myself to investors and to partly prove myself to friends that like I'm the guy that made this life experience happen that you just can't get anywhere else and we should explain the origin so you you go from magnesis I don't know what's in between but at some point you create this app called the fire app and the fire app was meant to like let you book a artist right so you could be like oh I want uh you know whatever Timberland to perform at a party I can send a booking request and he can accept or reject and there's no middlemen or minimum you know Less middlemen in the middle and so you know sort of create a Marketplace for you know people to book these artists that was the core idea and fire Festival was a marketing stunt to promote the app right but at some point the two kind of almost flipped in importance and firefestyle became the the overarching thing fire Festival starts uh from what I understand because you meet a guy who's like yo I have this little plane and I fly to these random Caribbean islands and you used to go on your weekends you know in this like four person plane hang out come back and you were like wow this is so dope people are like wow that sounds so dope you're like yeah you should come do this too and somehow your experience of like flying to these remote islands and having a having a good time became what if we fly 3 000 people down to this island and we do this like Festival this coachella-like Festival did I get that right so far I think you told the story better than me okay perfect but but somewhere along the way you get something where I'm fast forwarding this because I think you know it's documented in other places but I do want to explain it for somebody who's listening so somewhere along the way you're like all right we're doing this we're doing fire festival and you start promoting this thing and your method of promoting was what what was the marketing game plan to promote fire Festival so like it all kind of stems down too I was for all my terrible flaws I was really good at taking a tangible asset that most people didn't have and using that to launch a business so magnesis had this physical card that would cost me like two dollars to make per card and then a crazy townhouse so my entire Target demographic didn't have access to a black card they didn't have access to a multi-million dollar townhouse in downtown Manhattan when they're 23 years old so I took these two like inaccessible things gave it to my customers and used that to launch a business on top of fast forward to fire now I'm trying to cater to these you know b list rappers and comedians who need small bookings these people aren't Jay-Z they aren't Drake they don't have their own private island so here's where I come in okay now guys we have our own private island you want to be involved with me and then I use that to hopefully build the fire booking app so all my marketing strategy came down to taking a tangible good or service that wasn't available to a certain audience giving it to them making them feel like it's theirs and they own it and using that to build a business so that was the entire logic behind like the fire app and fire Festival component and as you perfectly said the importance quickly flipped as we launched the marketing for fire festival and fire Festival became it and fire app became you know a second thought for that period of time it's not like a bad plan it's not a bad idea I guess like you said like on the Pod I think when the documentaries came out we were like honestly it was a dope idea and somebody like if it had just been done like and it wasn't even like it's not like theranos where you're like that was a dope idea if somebody had just done it right it's like well maybe it's technically impossible your [ __ ] your thing was possible you just had shitty like Logistics and operations and poor planning you just threw up you just threw like the the idea of the event and then the actual the actual event did not live up to to the hype but your thing was totally possible um what what went wrong there why why were you not able to to pull off what you had sold the dream that you had sold were you Bella Hadid and you had [ __ ] I don't know Kendall Jenner and all the all these people promoting that hey we're going to this thing it's gonna be you know whatever the party of the century you sold the tickets so you got that part right it's just you didn't deliver the party do what the craziest thing is I think lying and unable to show weaknesses made the festival fail and I truly believe that my backers at the time were well connected and smart enough where it came to them and said hey look guys we did this great marketing campaign but I have no idea what the [ __ ] I'm doing they would have found like the best Festival people in the world to come and actually execute this but I was so scared to show that I couldn't handle it that I kept saying everything is great and everything is perfect and that pushed away the people that would have helped me it's like literally lying I think doomed the festival from day one post announcement who are the big Packers was it VCS or or family offices or what uh handful of venture funds and then you know 25 individuals everywhere from like larger family offices down to just smaller Angels who is the biggest fund or most well-known fund uh I just don't want to throw anybody under the bus so yeah oh okay I thought I wasn't sure if it was public uh I I think that some of the investor list was a good portion of the investor list I believe was sealed in the court files and I didn't ask for it to be sealed I think other people did so I just don't want to yeah sure don't want to do that our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better and so you uh you're like okay I I could have asked for help from uh or organizing people and this is where I think things get a little tricky so you brought up SPF um yeah I've I brought up theranos we're talking about fire Festival I think there's always a question of like was this intentionally supposed to be a fraud like oh I'm just gonna trick people and run away and uh you know like with FTX right now that's a question like did something happen that you weren't really paying attention to and then things got out of hand or from the beginning oh you were like I'm just gonna trick people and take their money um for you where did it's where did it start it like was it well intentioned at the beginning and where did it turn at what point did you realize oh I'm I'm I gotta just say this because I gotta get to the next dollar I gotta get to the next the next milestone so truly try to execute the event and literally up until people were arriving to the festival I thought it was gonna work and obviously that's so stupid looking back yeah you knew you had like [ __ ] you know tents and like grilled cheese sandwiches for for people who ordered Villas like what how could you how could you still believe that right up till the event are you sober this entire time by the way uh maybe the drugs but was like drinking a lot but no drugs drinking way too much never like I've smoked weed maybe six times in my life but I think it's like a common you know people are saying I was on Coke or whatever never tried Coke on my life so they could have a heart okay so yeah back to so you're you're in a sober-ish mindset and yeah you actually think it's gonna work the day of or the day before and I'm like Here's my thought process the island is so beautiful we have this like a local team who you couldn't script these characters they have the boats they have the jet skis they're gonna take people out like we know how to do these experiences if you have some crazy Pilots like it's just gonna be like a wild weekend that you've never had before and we have 30 artists who are paid so you're gonna have like A-list Talent one of the most beautiful places in my opinion like in the Atlantic Ocean and amazing group of these like movie scripted local characters who have toys for you to play on so I thought that like okay they'll go back and they'll have a shitty we don't have food and shelter and bathrooms but we got nature yeah yeah yeah who needs food when you have tubing but actually like I think the craziest thing is if we Market it like that it would have been amazing it would have been better okay guys I can't figure out the logistics I can't afford to to build like 500 houses but I somehow came up with the 5 million bucks for the artists we have these great people we have this great Island like bring a sleeping bag and figure this [ __ ] out I think of that mindset shift was marketed people would have been way more excited and they would have been like felt like they're owning the adventure and it would have been almost like yeah however many men years were and like the marketing like killed me at the end like the marketing sold tickets but it also made it fail what would the ideal outcome had been let's say that like it just so happened to work how much revenue and profit would it have made and like what would the ideal situation had had been so I have no idea like my entire are you [ __ ] kidding me how do you not know this so like I we had a budget for 10 million dollars for the festival I didn't have 10 million dollars but like okay I can reasonably raise 10 million dollars just off of this brand we're building right now for the festival um ended up spending way more than that and it got to the point where I would go to sleep with no money in the bank wake up and know that like that day I had to raise a certain dollar amount just to survive and some days it was 50 Grand some days it was four million dollars so I'd wake up at you know 9 A.M and know that I have until 2 pm to get X dollars in the bank to then rewire it out before the before the day ended so my life is [ __ ] hell and I just couldn't like zoom out so I was stuck okay today's two million dollars I can call this guy I can call this guy and like at the end of the day things keep getting bigger the brand is going to be so big if this Festival works everybody's gonna get paid and I just didn't like know how to really run the numbers at that point so how much did you end up spending we've raised 26 or 27 um but we were making money from other sources like we were selling tickets on top of that we were getting sponsors magnesis was making money I was doing consulting jobs so it's like literally like every day which is a different angle for money so you said maybe like 30 billion plus I would say in this six-month period it was probably closer to 40. and the tickets so you sold 7 000 tickets is that right I think it was probably just under six thousand it was just like around three thousand people per weekend some were given away for free and some were sold so we sold a little under six thousand let's call it five percent Revenue five thousand times what what's the average ticket what were you selling these for so the average the the the median ticket price was like 12 to 1500 however we sold like a handful of outlier tickets for like a couple hundred thousand dollars plus per ticket so so then it was in five thousand times two thousand you're uh what's that ten million you got 10 million yeah in sales uh and then did you have another couple million from sponsors or anything like that yeah and like the issue is that some of the ticket money was held in escrow some of it was for like these yachts and boats so it wasn't like pure 10 million dollars of free cash flow it was like everything was held up or not held up in certain ways I think like my stripe account got Frozen with like 700 Grand in the day the festival got canceled so it's like you know money was held in a bunch of different sources and areas so the the event itself didn't make any sense right it was like we're gonna make 10 million we're gonna spend 40 but you could have gotten so much more Profit just by running a 10 million or 40 million dollars of Facebook ads you know what I mean like this is just like a a better or a slightly different version of Cameo or something like that like these marketplaces are tried and true uh an event would have been cool if it were like a break even or a slight loss but that yeah but but put it this way like as for as wrong as things are and I can't do this tomorrow but if I did fire Festival again in three years I think almost all the first group as well as the rest of like pop culture would buy tickets just to be there to see how bad it is right like the brand the brand value is there just like how can I do it appropriately are you tempted to pick the right time to go I mean I have to do it again I just can't do it while I'm on probation I can't do it this year or next year but you know it has to be done again and I think no matter what success or failures I find along the way in Tech like until I execute fire have you seen his new company pirate go to the website dude trust me go to it it's p-y-r-t.com Billy like this is the same [ __ ] that you're doing a little bit like it's it's not like you said you could program like like when I see what you're doing and I you had you did the Met Gala thing where you got in trouble for scamming people out of that I'm like hey just do a [ __ ] course dude just create of course and make two million like me and Sean make seven figures a year from this stupid stuff it's not stupid it provides value but I mean it's like insignificant compared to an event or like you said you liked the program and you like content sites like just do something like boring and straight why are you doing this pirate thing it's like the same [ __ ] there's so many things that's gonna go that could potentially go wrong it's just the the stakes are so much higher than just creating some boring ass software I hear you um I think pirate is actually is that what you're suggestions no uh Billy we have uh 3 000 people coming tomorrow I hear you no you might very well be right and I think the thing that we're getting back to with pirate is like I'm not trying to host a thousand people on an island it's not gonna work I want to get back to those trips on the small planes with a dozen people or two dozen people that did work well for a couple of years and it has to be like a tour guide for a few years of my life and like eat [ __ ] like I'm gonna go do that but I can give a couple of dozen people this amazing adventurous experience and then while I'm doing that I'd like to find interesting ways to broadcast those experiences to all their followers and then give their followers a way to get involved so I'm not trying to figure out the logistics to host thousands of people I know I can host two dozen people and if I can take five years to build like really interesting like virtual reality esque Tech that allows anybody to like watch and actually influence what's happening I think that's like a really cool win and way to kind of get back to what I'm good at this is a horrible idea yeah dude it I I actually don't think it's a horrible idea if it like I think you potentially are you're you're um you rank so high in capability and so high in in ignorance like and that's like a perfect combination I think of starting a business which is like this like confidence of like I think I can pull this off and I'm capable of some things that's actually a beautiful combination but you also have this third part of the of the pie chart where it's just like reputation and like past and owing money I just don't understand why you're doing this it just you can you you are brilliant at a lot of things that just seems like such a startup just a boring ass agency that makes 20 million a year and 10 million in profit yeah if you just did like an event like a stunt marketing agency or uh or something so we have that we're announcing it today actually it's called the pirate Collective and that's how we're fun that's what we're trying to fund I guess our attack is so let's walk through this okay so I'm on the podcast I'm on the pirate website and it says there's a picture of a private island so we're already getting flashbacks of fire and then it says join the crew a pirate is somebody who turns The Impossible into Adventure he says give me your phone number and then it says join the treasure hunt virtual reality so what you're saying from what what I just gathered of what you just described is that you're gonna take you know six to 15 people at a time on those like little planes to the islands like you used to do where it's not such a heavy logistical lift um yeah those people are gonna have a great time they'll pay five grand or 10 grand or something I'm just guessing here they'll pay a lot of money to have this really cool adventurous experience and then you're going to use you know video plus maybe virtual reality to broadcast that experience to other people who can't afford to go and or maybe their friends and their social media um yeah and they get to maybe buy a virtual ticket to kind of attend the party that way and you're gonna do that a bunch of times did I describe it right or did I I'm just guessing based on what you said what you said absolutely so the last thing that you're missing is that the people who are basically so essentially we're going to partner with this little hotel they'll handle all the hospitality and Logistics we'll host artists there on a regular basis we'll rig the hotel with these 360 cameras live stream everything that's happening then give the people who are watching the live stream the ability to buy in and affect what's happening on the island so they could like have one of the artists go to the recording studio and impact the creative process when they're making their song or they can buy the talent like a drink you know and make them take a tequila shot because you should just have you gone for being Mr Beast like we hung out with Mr Beast and yeah you're wired just like that nut and uh and I feel like if you just channeled your energy towards how do I do the craziest thing that's gonna make the craziest video that 20 million people are gonna watch and then continually one up yourself uh I feel like that would work that's my suggestion to you know and you absolutely have the you have the Charisma and you have the storytelling ability just dude just do just just make you and like a small team doing the crazy [ __ ] and do ad dollars but it sounds like you're sharing you want to share your screen you could share your screen I I heard you click it around I bet you sure I'm not supposed to share this but okay but uh I want to get back to what you just said I like that attitude I like that so um this was an island we were working with unfortunately I'm not allowed to go to the Bahamas so this is just pure like demo purpose but the idea is to take like a one-to-one virtual representation of a property track where all the talent is in real time track where all the toys are in real time and then people can click into various live streams once they're watching a live stream hopefully watching their favorite Talent they could actually choose these actions to affect what's really happening there so it could be as crazy as me swimming in the reef and the users deciding to Chum the water and given the sharks in the area I think a lot of people want to see see that happen or as simple as buying somebody a drink but and what what would the financials of this be like I mean I'm sure you've now thought about that more you're like what would the p l what would what does this no it surely has it's like one day one day it could do this what's that one day so a million people paying 20 cents to ask a talent to do something or to contribute an action towards like the real world so if everybody pays 20 cents to Chum the water and a million people are chumming the water then that's kind of where the financials come in sorry I can't do that just tell me like in in five years are you in your head you're like I think we could do like a hundred million dollars in eight years like what what's the you're not getting me arrested Sam I don't want to promise any Revenue but no no sorry don't promise I'm just saying like when you're laying in bed you're like I think this could become like a 100 million dollar Company by doing this I think what's the way I think about this and my logic could be wrong is that once again I we're not going to be using the Bahamas but for example the Bahamas gets around four-ish million tourists a year and if we're doing these really interesting broadcasts we can have more than four four million people in a single day like virtually come to the island so if we can just like totally destroy their tourism numbers in a virtual scale I think it's a big Revenue opportunity so okay so where did you come up with this idea were you in prison or was it once you got out that you were like all right I'm gonna start my brainstorm no I was in solitary confinement and it's like totally totally confined and you know a lot of it was just like reflection and then a lot of it too is I want to get outside of these walls and just like get back to Adventure and then find a way to share this so we should say by the way that's kind of where you got into solitary because you attempted to do a podcast from inside prison yeah uh terribly what well first did you know that was not allowed was that I didn't even realize that would be such a faux pas like that that was that would be such a course that would be a faux pas I think the biggest thing is great dude they read your mail and [ __ ] you can't like and like each [ __ ] each inmate you have like different roles for you right like if a journalist calls you and you do an interview is that allowed that's allowed um I was wrong the toughest part though is like it was a gray area I think if it was a clear violation of the rules My Punishment would have been like less strict I used the pay phone like their available pay phones um but at the same time like you can't cause attention to the jail right and that's what I did so I understand like why it was like so incredibly stupid but I think if I had a clear violation of the rules I would have gone to solitary for like 45 days and not seven months you basically had a podcast host call you on the pay phone and then you did your side of the podcast from the pay phone in like 10 minute or 15 minute increments right because that's what you were allowed exactly exactly okay yeah I mean I understand why you think that's great it's like what's the difference between prostitution and pornography you know it's like I don't know if there's a camera there it's like you're you're safe like you know I mean like you're like playing this like uh like I don't know if I would be if I would be risking things at that moment I mean I I've done I've when I was in college I did stupid stuff and I got in trouble and I remember getting in trouble and thinking like I don't ever want to come back to jail again and more so solitary confinement seems like I would kill myself I think I would want to commit suicide like that sounds like that's like the seven months in a box it seems like the worst that's the worst possible outcome let alone like you know getting life you know like El Chapo and some of these guys in in these like Florence and all these like high high level security what was that like seven months being in that cell I get anxious just thinking about it I actually think that it's counterproductive in terms of Reform if that kind of makes sense and the other time in jail like I don't think it's going to have a long lost long-lasting negative impacts in my life I did 10 months total in solitary one time for three one time for seven I think like that actually makes it more likely that I make a mistake in the future and obviously if I do make a mistake it's totally on me but like the mental hangover that I have where it's like somebody out there could snap their fingers and put me into a concrete box like that's scary like that's what gives me the nightmares at night and I think that like if anything that makes you know ideas bigger or different because you're kind of fearful of that outcome so I don't know it's [ __ ] hard and like there are guys who have done way more than 10 months and I can't imagine what they feel like but I think that's like the worst part of the experience and actually it's just counterproductive did you know it was going to be seven months or is it like do you know there's an end point or you didn't know no and I think if they said hey this is seven months then you're getting out and then you're going home the year after that it would have been totally different but the fact that they kept [ __ ] with me basically saying hey you're never getting out of here you're gonna get in trouble more like that was the biggest mind [ __ ] you just like wake up every morning and be like this is never gonna end why like you mean the the guards were just [ __ ] yeah in the jail they literally in response to the podcast they tried to send me to a terrorist facility called the CM the CMC in Marion Illinois you can like look at their inmates on Wikipedia like I'd be one of two non-terrorist in that facility and they would come and [ __ ] with me and like pass like program statements under my door for this communication management unit like here's where you're going McFarland and like I thought they were bluffing and then like a day later oh we submitted you there and like it legitimately tried to send me to a terrorist facility and it's like you're never getting out what's gonna happen that is [ __ ] crazy I I think that like whenever I was thinking I remember talking to my wife at the time when you were getting in trouble and I'm like unfortunately I think four or five years probably is a fair is it's probably a fair punishment I don't think solitary is a fair punishment and I don't think being like tormented is fair though you know like let's just say you went to jail not because you threw a bad Festival you went to jail for what was the exact reason lying to investors and like and you lied what about the financials or what did you lie about yes badly financials Revenue personal company what were you doing what were you doing wire fraud I think is the the main charge but there are a couple couple surrounding charges as well but basically anytime you lie to get money it's essentially wire fraud in the eyes of the federal government but you you are making fake documents like you were photoshopping things and making fake PDFs I think right yeah I made I just made fake like Excel documents basically saying hey our income is x million this month and it wasn't close so I was you know totally guilty it was it wasn't like it wasn't a gray area I was black and white wrong right the festival was better than I advertised which is obviously impossible I still haven't gone to jail when you um so I remember being like okay wow that's crazy uh sounds like you know he got kind of in over his head you know and I I was having some sort of sympathy in a way and then there was some story like when you were on probation then you did something else you created something called like VIP access or some [ __ ] like that Gala yeah and then that was also like you know you know freaking little figures in some way what was that and how do you defend that part right because that's after the fact now yeah and you're you're already on probation and and was it just like I just had a habit of doing this what was going on there the only defense is that I was a [ __ ] idiot like there's no other way to to to get around that um yeah I was totally wrong and I kind of got in this mindset where it's all about the money I'm like that's probably wrong but then figured hey I need to find a way to pay everybody back and let's get back to what I was doing at magnesis at the end to kind of fun fire Festival which is to sell these tickets right and you needed like you needed like a like if I was your father I would have just I would have punched you in the [ __ ] face and I'd be like Billy like this is you're you're hurting me you're like you're you're hurt like you needed like a like uh like someone just to be like dude you are so talented but you are [ __ ] this up so much it's like these are such clear mistakes I don't understand why I don't understand like did you not have a friend that was like it sounds like you were trying to trying to do a quick fix if I can get the money back if I could pay people back then I'm not going to get in trouble about the other thing is that is that accurate is what you were thinking I was scared of jail like no one was picking up my calls anymore I'm on you know on bond I guess and like I just couldn't once again I couldn't zoom out and understand the bigger picture where if I sat down shut the [ __ ] up yeah sure I'll be broke for a couple of years but I'll go to jail for two or three years and I'll get out my late 20s and you know have a chance to pay people back the right way and I just like couldn't understand that but yeah I think that like going forward a big thought process for me and it's been three months is you know how do I position myself whether like whether it's a company or something else like to get the help I need and do I operate within a bigger company do I find like partners that you know are senior to me and experience in age who I can like trust and defer to so it's just all part of my journey right now and I think that like this time around I think I prefer those boundaries more and it's just trying to find it and it's been you know super early in the process are you gonna raise funding for this next company I I think a lot of people I don't know but if I had a bet I would say you probably actually could raise I bet you there's people that would give you money is that so I I texted a I texted like eight Venture funds a few weeks ago and you know was literally like a broken grammar like two-line sentence like two told me to [ __ ] off like you know one didn't respond you know one asked for more questions and four just like responded in like you know within a minute saying we're in um the issue is you know as I've kind of gone through the process I'm actually not allowed due to an SEC deal um I'm not allowed to raise Securities so I can't go and raise money uh I think the ironic part is that like it's probably gonna it would have been easier this time to raise Venture money and like no decks like none of that [ __ ] like I said I have no decks here's all here's all I have and uh yeah people want to back it I just can't raise the funds so and I I think that would shock people is that yeah you know you just had a 50 hit rate on uh on a text message how do you explain that to somebody who's listening and they're like you know there's some people who are frustrated that that's the case I can't believe people would find him how would you explain to them because it's people people are making this decision they're smart people they're capable people they have other options yeah uh how would you explain why why somebody would be willing to do that so I started trying to raise money for the first time almost 12 over 12 years ago now and you know as with everybody the first ex-people told me to [ __ ] off and kind of laughed at me and like so I went through 12 years of [ __ ] including 10 months of solitary confinement to like get to the point where maybe an investor believes that I've learned enough lessons to focus on what I'm good at get help with what I'm bad at so it's not like it's like wake up one day and can raise money it was it was it's been 12 years of just like totally [ __ ] up to get to this point but yeah and I think that before I raise money and obviously like legally I can't do it and I'm not going to be allowed to do it is I need the help right and I need like the system and the structure in place where let me go and market and like come up with these experiences and Adventures and you know Drive attention but have somebody else who could just help me manage like financials and Logistics and operations what other ideas did you have if you weren't going to do something fire festivaly uh did you have like other I'm sure you had a lot of time on your hands to think of other ideas did you think about any other potential potential things you could do with your time maybe not even businesses yeah just other things you might do um I think if someone wants to go on an early really understand uh gpt3 like the what's kind of power in the open Ai and just become an expert on that I think you can be like make a killing as a consultant and like teaching all these big Brands like what's happening there and like what's gonna happen the thing that's like one option to kind of go and like become a gpt3 like expert and like be the YouTuber Brands is your experience with gbt3 since sorry when you got out six months ago uh yeah I actually was reading about it for like a year in jail uh didn't even like know open AI was a name in the company or anything like that but it's like had random book sent in so I was like oh this is super interesting and like have dozens of pages and notes on it maybe I'll post them but like and then kind of come out and see what happened recently which is pretty cool so I agree I think that could be a great company and I bet you'd kill it because you're pretty good at selling uh yeah by the way you yes I think if I was close with you I'd be like Billy do that uh what what else what else has excited you what other ideas I think the concept of fire app which is providing transparency to a lot of these like Legacy Entertainment Systems is interesting um one I think which is really interesting right now is like Performance Marketing for like social media and influencers so I think one the reason why the fire just take a step back the reason why the fire Festival marketing I think works so well is at the exact same time we had 400 people post this orange tile but these 400 people weren't related right it was some music artists like some comedians some athletes some models so when you're in our target audience and you're scrolling through your Instagram feed you're like why the [ __ ] are these five people who don't know each other all posting this right now like I need to go check this out so one idea I had is that basically creating like a Marketplace for influencer marketing where let's say like Starbucks has a new coffee that they want to advertise they can go and upload all their creative assets and set like a million dollar budget and then anybody around the world could take those assets and post it to their Instagram or their Tick Tock or their YouTube and then they basically get a score for how much engagement they get in their content and their overall score gets them a percentage of the budget so if Kim Kardashian posts it and she crushes it you know she gets 900 Grand 100 000 is split up to you know another million people who all kind of posted I think it's like a fun way to remove all these [ __ ] middlemen in this whole social marketing world and then allow a brand to turn all of their followers into advertisers for that company without dealing with any of the legwork it's almost like clout do you remember clout with a K yeah yeah I do like yeah overall social score right yeah and it it it they raised a ton of money and probably sold for less than their valuation of 100 million dollars or I think they sold for 100 which was less I think than what they raised at but I actually thought it was a fantastic idea for some reason it didn't work I don't know why but you you'd be in that space a little bit it sounds like yeah I think it's interesting it's like providing a score to how well your content performs and getting paid off of that but then turning everybody into your promoters yeah I think that's a really cool idea uh it also flips the model on its head right now you have to do sort of individual manual Outreach and then negotiations and then whatever versus just saying it's in the reverse here's a giant honey pot if you want it go get it you know um and then basically divving it up based on the actual performance versus uh you know who can negotiate the best you know uh okay so that's a really cool idea what else you got yeah yeah those are my two so I love you too ppt3 expert and then providing Like An Open Marketplace where Brands can upload their creative assets and anybody can kind of publish them and get paid business and why not do that one yeah and why not why why do you set it on the one versus those two I mean they sound quite reasonable yeah maybe I'll do them yeah no you won't and I don't think you will I think like I don't know I don't think you will like I don't know I guess you just have this like you must have a fire in you where you're no pun intended where you're like I have to go this event route which is which is baffling I mean but I guess people just passionate people are passionate about certain things I get it yeah but uh logically I just I have such I don't want to see you fail I guess I want to see you succeed and like prove people wrong and I I want to prove that like Second Chances could work and so when I see this I'm like oh man you're just playing this game on hard mode like yeah I think you're not making the same mistakes on the obviously on the uh I have no idea but like that'd be crazy if you're making the same mistakes as far as what got you into prison but you're also choosing a business model that's super hard uh like you know you're talking about a million people paying 20 cents to Chum the waters and it's like I don't even know like those words have never even been said together uh right so it's like you know you're choosing to try to pull off a really uh really really difficult thing um yeah and you know it just seems like I guess Like My Philosophy is always like in in business there's no extra points for difficulty um in fact you get you're getting docked points for difficulty the harder something is uh you know the less money you end up making and and so there are no bonus points for doing things the hard way now on the other side there is one advantage which is when you go do something cool and audacious every day you wake up and you're motivated and maybe you can recruit people who are motivated to pull off something epic um because epic things have their own you know motivational draw to actually go and do your best work which which he just did I saw on your Twitter and I think Tick Tock you said hey everyone I'm hiring for my new thing how many uh applicants did you get yeah so back to a business idea I think it's really interesting is we partner with a company called Bounty Hunter world to hire and they're trying to disrupt the whole recruiter model where they're saying anybody can refer a friend to a job and if you successfully refer someone you get paid that recruiting fee and as you guys know like those fees could be crazy so I think like they're super awesome and then we tried to like one-up it so we're saying anybody who refers a friend to Pirate that we end up hiring we take that person on one of these pirate experiences so trying to like give the island Entertainer experience to like any of our fans um we've had a lot of people apply for jobs I think the craziest thing is like we have no money and I'm probably like paying 15 to 20 of what I was paying for the same role five or six years ago and probably getting like better people so think it all goes to show like your mission and your intention is just so much more important than anything how big is the list of this like I put my phone number into this thing how big is the list how many people have have signed up to like do the treasure hunt around two thousand Okay so yeah it's not bad I'm shocked you didn't get more because the milk boys thing that got 1.5 million views that I've been getting a lot of inbound it's like social like Instagram DMs I think are just have gone crazy um I think the conversion's like a phone number through a platform has been a little bit harder for us but yeah overall like how do we kind of organize all these DMS and maybe that's a different business too if someone can build an inbox that takes inbound across like Instagram DMS uh LinkedIn like in mail your like your public email address and organize all of that and like kind of qualify those leads that's something that I would pay for on a monthly basis and you like you're you're and you're building all of this right now with I think you said you collected 150k in Revenue so far from like brand deals or something like that and so yeah November first yeah so you're building this bit oh since November 1st well I mean that's a pretty good run rate already yeah so but you're you're building this business now you have 170 000 just to to play with that's kind of what your starting point yeah don't worry we spent it already did you really I mean like we're just trying to trying to survive so dude have you ever heard of like pilot or badge dude there's these like really good accounting like software companies that you could use it's like a thousand a month and they'll just like tell you like your p l like yeah you should or like a or like a part-time CFO like I don't know man maybe that would be a good investment I need all of it I need like I need help yeah have you ever heard of QuickBooks I mean like I don't know man I think you should like really sweat the details on this stuff FDX use QuickBooks and look what happens well correlation not causation but I know I mean speaking of that what do you think you you know I've been following we had um Sean and I have both interacted a bit with Martin shkreli and unfortunately you know you're in the same vein there's you there's Martin and then there's now uh uh I think Sean doesn't like SPF because winners don't get accurate winners don't get nicknamed he's just he's just Samuel now but what do you think what's your take on the uh what's gonna happen with him uh 40 years and then hopefully after like yeah then he'll get out after like 15 to 20. do you think that's fair that's my guess um I don't know I talked to Martin after he got out and I was like what was it like in prison and he had a bunch of stories where he's like yeah I created a cryptocurrency study Club I uh you know I I had like you know all these like he's like yeah we had the system where I was you know selling information blah blah I was reading tons of books I had access to the internet he's like I would be under the covers at night like basically watching uh Khan Academy videos learning about like calculus and um what's it what do you do to pass the time what was your life like I think the hardest part about prison is it's designed to strip you of your ambition right because like there are great people there and I bet some really incredible people but there also are a lot of bad people and you can't put bad people into an environment where they're inspired and they have ambition to act on their bad impulses so there's this concept of being institutionalized and essentially it's meant to just make you a human robot and I think it's like good in a certain way that it makes it time easier but like naturally I was just trying to fight against like all like the set processes as much as possible so I think it made my time go really really slow I was trying to fight to like find ways to stay creative what's the next environment meant to make you robot like they feed you at the same time every day like they turn the lights off at the same time you can only use your phones from a certain period of time like just everything is like structured like this like you have to wear your uniform to go to lunch and it's like if you're trying to find ways where like you know trying to find my creative periods and just not make every day the same so I can just like keep different ideas flowing and coming what were some things you did successfully to kind of like amuse yourself what was little what were your maybe a little tactics the little wins you had as to keep that creative you know spark alive yeah uh training a lot of boxing so um I had like a soulmate who's a performer Puerto Rican like professional boxer and he could like wrap his hands with towels and like you know train me in boxing which is super fun um we didn't have that guys take like toilet paper rolls and wrap them in tube socks and use that like for for mitts so yeah it's like finding like creative ways to to go and like exercise and for your mind and like do little things you're not supposed to it doesn't hurt anybody like you couldn't practice martial arts but you know you go in the back and have the guy hold your mitts for you for a half hour you can kind of get away with it it's like a good good way to escape you look like you're in better shape yeah I was fat as hell what are some um stereotypes that you know we would have about your experience that either proved to be true or like that maybe weren't true uh about the whole experience the whole like racial segregation totally holy thing yeah yeah totally thing um I think like being in New York I'm a little naive and spoiled to I I guess like a lot of what probably exists in other parts of the world but literally being in a place where if you're black you go on this line for lunch and if you're white you go on this line for lunch and you just can't cross over it's like wild it just like feels like it's 60 years behind the times and obviously something that I haven't experience in in New York and and like probably spoil to that sense but really kind of getting over the racial issues or I think kind of a weird hard part for me and it's probably like what's weird about it is like when they separate by races it's not always out of a place of hate it's just like no this is just you stay with us they go with them yeah and it's not necessarily that they're they hate the other group it's just this is just how we do things yeah it's always been done this way it's just how we're going to do it and like there certainly are terrible racists on both sides but the majority aren't there's like this is the way it's done so this is the way we're gonna do it like it doesn't really make sense but if you could go in and change one way that the prison system works well while still you know achieving the goal and the job to be done of of a prison what would you change uh now that you've kind of saw it from the inside I think that I would make sentencing more equal across the board and there are a lot of people who committed the exact same crime Hood wildly different sentences and this is almost like an interesting problem maybe this is a really cool business is to build some sort of like AI sentencing thing because like right now it's up to one independent judge and that judge like in my case I could have gotten nothing or I could have gotten 20 years I'm like literally one person can decide the fate of your life um and I think what I got is fair for me but many other people's senses weren't fair so maybe it's some sort of system that takes in all the information around someone's crime and their personal life then studying everybody else who has had similar crimes and seeing who was successful and actually sentencing based on this idea of you know future success well what are some examples of different punishments or different sentences based off a different similar crimes so I think for my situation it was a financial crime and typically your sentence is based on what the dollar amount that victims lost is so the more you lose the more time you should get I think like there's plenty of people who were from New York whose dollar amounts were hundreds of millions of dollars who got one or two years then I go out to a jail in Detroit where there's people who have lost five hundred thousand dollars who got 30 years so it's like just like they're just total disparity where it shouldn't be like that I don't think sentences are based on future success and some judges are like I think kind enough and smart enough to do that but but some aren't so almost like having this AI system that recommends a sentence in addition to the judge there's like a different data point I think it'd be super interesting yeah that's that's a cool that is crazy because like it could be like that this happens where a judge is in a bad mood or uh has seen certain patterns that are biased and yeah I mean that is it is pretty wild you know I've had friends like go through some of this stuff and they're like oh he this person was in a great mood today and I just or I just happened to get this person who falls under this political party and this is what happened it is that is pretty crazy It's just tough I'm like look at Elizabeth Holmes she realistically could have gotten two years or she got it she could have gotten 35 years right and it's like it's up to one person to determine like what that length of time is and that's a it's like a big task for someone to take on and yeah unfortunately the system isn't fair yeah so do they have like a like a like you know if you go to a company and you're gonna get a job it's not just up to the manager to just pick a random number for what you get to get paid it's like no we know for this job title with this many years of experience this is the range and the range is between this this and this and if you're going to go outside of that range you got to have like a pretty strong indicator and it's like people have to be notified that I'm going way outside the range the the normal like expected range in order to make this offer uh it's almost like they kind of need that or I don't maybe they have a version of that for judges who are trying to send this they have a guideline system that gives you a recommended range and that definitely helps and it's good I think the issue though is that it's really hard for the judge to get to know someone such a short period of time and those who have access to Great attorneys have an advantage because like your attorney's entire job in the federal system is like you're going to lose the case it's all about presenting who you really are as a person and why you should be afforded a second chance at some point in the future so people who don't have access to Quality attorneys just don't really have that same opportunity to explain why this should have a second chance and so I think that the AI probably benefits more of your like lower income defendant which is most of them who can't afford their own attorneys to to show they're more of a human than just like what the crime is did you have a fancy lawyer I had a good lawyer so like and I just made it impossible for him right like getting in trouble again on bail there's like nothing he could have done oh just opposed [ __ ] like I could have had 20 lawyers it wouldn't have mattered I would have you know have Sean have you ever seen the movie Catch Me If You Can of course great movie and so I read about that guy a lot Frank abnaily Jr and turns out most of what like he he made this book about his crimes and turns out it's likely like mostly lies I think like they prove like he's been proven time and time again that he didn't actually do what he said he did in terms of crimes but he like glamorized it and then he turned it into like a pretty successful Consulting business I don't know how big but like I looked up where he lives and he's got like a you know multi-million dollar home and he's always wearing these nice suits and he looks like he's he's done a good job when I look at him Billy I'm like well that guy is kind of like a good example of like what you know turning [ __ ] into gold and like turning a situation around what did you ever think about kind of going that route like I think that like I would just yeah I'd hate to live off of like fire for the rest of my life and then there's like a short window opportunity where the attention from it will allow my next business just to start with the springboard but I'd much rather be known for and fail or succeed at a new business than being someone who just talks about fire festival for next 30 Years like that's boring as [ __ ] but I I understand why some people would would want it I agree it is boring but when you you know are in debt of 25 million dollars it's like well you know like I unfortunately I have to sacrifice my excitement in order to like make this work on the other hand he has got nothing to lose really well what does he have to lose he's got like all right well starting back from scratch reputation was pretty tainted and in a pretty deep restitutional hole where you got to pay back like 25 30 million dollars or something like that why not swing and do what you want with your life versus uh you know I guess I guess it is there in a way it is it is a good idea to just go for like the mo whatever is the most sort of exciting and fun and fulfilling thing for you and how do you find Pride right like I think that talking about it like a failed business when I was 24 and 25 when I'm 40 I'm not gonna wake up with juice to keep going like I think like if I see somebody else doing that I'm like oh what a [ __ ] loser I kind of want to be that person so I'd rather go and like try to improve and like whether I fail or succeed is try something new and different and try to build something so if it all works if life goes the way you want it and you're now 65 70 years old what Billy McFarland who who is he what happened if it all works out for you yeah he took his failures learned from it used it as a springboard to build something new and like whether it's pirate or something else that I do in 10 years from now and and one for it but like made good friends and help people along the way and if I can pay back 25 million dollars amazing if I pay back a million dollars but you know I try it and do it honestly like that's okay too I think and yeah and I actually I think that a lot of the investors listening would probably agree with that if as long as it's kind of done the right way I think at this point it's less about the money and more about how I change well we appreciate you coming on you know this was like uh when we were I Was preparing for this and I was like man I don't know how to approach this I don't want to like glamorize someone who's done something bad but like this was a really confusing thing to do but I'm happy we are able to talk I I'm gonna be following your story very closely I'm very eager to see how you pulled this off um and frankly I want you to pull you know I want I want Redemption to be real and and I want it to work everyone deserves a second chance so I hope I hope it does thank you guys super cool to finally be here so Sam and Sean thank you guys thanks for coming on [Music] foreign [Music]
